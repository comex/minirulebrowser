The following is a first draft of a paper on breaking the rules of a
game, and what happens after. I intend to add an Appendix applying
the lessons learned to the specific Nomic context out of which the
issues addressed in the paper originally arose. Any comments, pointing
out gaps or unclarities in the argument, or objections, or suggestions,
are welcomed.

Breaking the Rules
==================
By Steve Gardner

1. Retractable and non-retractable errors

The question I wish to address in this essay is an easy one to state:
how should play proceed in a game when the rules have been broken?
This is a question which even relatively simple games must address in
some way, for whenever people engage in any rule-governed activity, the
possibility of the rules being broken must always be present. However,
we shall see that although it is a quite straightforward matter to
deal with breaches of the rules in simple games, for more complex
games, this problem becomes one of considerable subtlety.

It is natural that this aspect of game play should in its turn be
governed by rules. However, these rules are of a different character
to the rules which govern the ordinary processes of play, for they
speak not only about those processes, but also about the rules which
govern them, and how they are to be applied. Hence it is natural to
refer to the rules which govern play when the (other) rules have been
broken as *meta-rules*. I will follow this usage for the rest of
this essay.

For simple games, the meta-rules will usually be implicit. Consider
one of the simplest and most widely known games, tic-tac-toe. Like
many games, it is played on a grid, and a legal move, it is generally
understood, consists of placing a marker, an 'X' or an 'O', in one of
the squares of the grid.  It is not a legal move to place a marker
straddling two or more squares. But what if, to your surpise, your
opponent were to play in this fashion? 

Let us begin our discussion by assuming that the illegality of this
move is immediately detected. Although this will seem a trivial point
in relation to tic-tac-toe, it will later assume considerable
significance, so bear with me. Later we shall be able to relax this
assumption, and see what ensues.

A very natural response to this kind of attempted move, which I
shall call variously a breach of the rules, a violation of the rules,
or just an error, would be to point out that it is not according to
the rules of tic-tac-toe, and to demand that it be retracted. (It is
irrelevant for our purposes exactly how one might go about proving
that this move is in fact illegal according to the rules of tic-tac
-toe. Let us stipulate that you are able to demonstrate this to the
satisfaction of your opponent. Perhaps she is a small child to whom
you are teaching the game, who will take your word in these matters
as authoritative.) What happens then? Well, if your opponent agrees
that her move was illegal, then she retracts it.

But what is meant by 'retraction'? There are two possible senses to
distinguish: it might mean that the move is considered to have been
played, and then taken back; or it might mean that the move is
considered not to have been played at all. 'Retraction', as I am using 
the word, has the second of these senses. For those who find it difficult
to distinguish these cases, we can think of the difference in terms
of what a recorder of the moves of the game would normally record. 
Consider for example the illegal opening move in chess: 1. Nb3. Let
us imagine tham I am playing chess with you and that I make this
illegal move. You point out that this move is illegal, and I agree,
so I put the knight back on b1 and instead play 1. Nc3. A recorder of
the moves of this chess game will record this as 1. Nc3, not as 1.
Nb3 (illegal move) Nb1 (retraction) Nc3.  This is in accordance with
the convention that, for ordinary purposes, *only the legal moves of a
game count as part of the game*. For instance, if you want to
reconstruct the chess game which we played subsequent to my illegal
move, you will not include the illegal move as a part of your
reconstruction. You will not begin by saying, "Well, first you played
your knight to b3, then you took it back to b1, then you played it to
c3...". You will quite rightly take it that the game begins with my
move 1. Nc3. So, when I say that a move is retracted, I shall mean
that it is considered not to have taken place, that it is not considered
to have been a part of the game. We shall see that does not prevent the
rules of a game from recognizing, and if appropriate, penalizing, an
*attempt* to make such a move.

Returning to our tic-tac-toe example: your opponent makes an illegal
move by placing her marker straddling two squares. You point out
that this move is illegal. She retracts the move, and (abstracting
away from complications to be introduced presently), makes another,
legal, move instead. That the players follow this course of action
and not some other (which is perfectly possible), is dictated by a
meta-rule of tic-tac-toe, which must say, in effect:

      Markers which are not placed legally on the grid, as described
      in other rules, shall be removed from the grid, and the player
      whose turn it was shall continue by making a legal play, if one
      is possible.

Generalizing, the meta-rule says, essentially, this: 

(1)   Illegal moves are retracted, and play then continues according
      to other rules as if the illegal move had not been played. 

This is a meta-rule for many simple games, and can even serve
reasonably well in some quite complex games. Of course, for complex
games, the meta-rules dealing with violations are much more likely to
be explicitly included in the rules of the games themselves. This is
only natural, since having more complicated rules makes it more
likely that some players will misunderstand them, and hence try to
move in ways which are in fact illegal. It is perhaps in order to
provide an incentive to players to learn the rules quickly, and hence
to expedite the smooth flow of the game by reducing attempts at
illegal moves, that many games introduce complications of (1), along
the lines of

(2)   Illegal moves are retracted, and the player making the illegal
      move suffers a game penalty. With this exception, play then
      continues as if the illegal move had not been played.

Meta-rule (2) shows that it is not essential, when errors occur, that
the course of play be completely unaffected by them. Meta-rule (2)
can serve as the template for meta-rules even for highly evolved,
complex and sophisticated games. What is more, (2) can itself be
further complicated into

(3)   Illegal moves are retracted, and the player making the illegal
      move either suffers a game penalty, or is forced to play in some
      specified manner, or both. Play then continues according to other
      rules.

A meta-rule like (3) is already sophisticated enough to be used in
chess: if a player moves a piece illegally, we may require that she
lose 1 minute on her clock, and must make a legal move with the piece
she attempted to move illegally, if that is possible. Play then
continues normally.

Note that in moving from (2) to (3) we have moved still further away
from a treatment of error which tries to restore the former game
state precisely to whatever it was before the error was made (which
was our response to errors made playing tic-tac-toe). Nevertheless,
meta-rules (1) to (3) still have in common the concept of *retraction*, 
and I will refer to errors which are treated in this way as *retractable 
errors*.

The question now arises: are all errors retractable? It is easy to 
see that they are not. There are some errors the nature of which
guarantee that they are not retractable. For example, consider a game
whose rules require that an action be performed within a certain time.
Then clearly, failure to perform that action within the required time
constitutes a breach of the rules, and merits any penalties which are
incurred for such breaches. But the idea of retracting this error is
a nonsense; that would require that we somehow change the past.
Similarly, if the rules of a game require that certain information
remains secret from some or all of the players, then the revelation
of this information to those players likewise constitutes a breach of
the rules that can be penalized, but which cannot be undone. Errors
such as these, which cannot in principle be retracted, I shall call,
unimaginatively, *non-retractable errors*. Examples of non-retractable
errors are such things as fouls in various sports (soccer, basketball,
snooker, etc), or misplays in card games such bridge or poker.

The meta-rules for dealing with non-retractable errors will, of
course, say nothing about retraction. They will say simply 

(4)   A player who commits a (non-retractable) illegal move incurs
      a game penalty, or is forced to play in some specified manner,
      or both. Play then continues according to other rules.


2. Error detection and retractability

So far, so good. We appear to have a nice, clear-cut distinction
between retractable and non-retractable errors. We can use the
distinction to classify all the different errors which can arise in
game play, and the distinction will also tell us the appropriate
kinds of meta-rules which our games should include for dealing with
them. 

However, this pleasing result was achieved only under an important
assumption: that errors are detected as soon as they occur. When we
relax this assumption, a worrying new phenomenon emerges, one which
will require us to complicate our account of breaking the rules. For
if we allow that errors may go undetected for some time, then we must
face the possibility that when an error is detected (if it ever is),
that it may be practically impossible, or at the very least
undesirable, for it to be retracted. For non-retractable errors, this
poses no problem, since we do not expect them to be retracted in any
case. But for retractable errors, this possibility raises new
questions, and it is therefore on retractable errors that I now wish
to concentrate.

For retractable errors, a new distinction is forced upon us: between
those retractable errors which may be retracted in practice, and
those which may only be retracted in theory, but which in practice
are not retractable. This last class of errors, the errors
retractable in theory but not in practice, seems to occupy a kind of
middle ground between the retractable and non-retractable errors, and
so threatens to undermine our neat distinction. Furthermore, the
existence of this class of errors leaves us wondering whether or not
we ought to say of them that they are considered to be a part of the
game. For recall that it was the distinguishing mark of retractable
errors that they are retracted, that is, considered not to have been
a part of the game. But if we are to have theoretically retractable
errors which are not in fact retracted, that would appear to leave us
in the uncomfortable position of admitting that some illegal moves
are to be considered to have been a part of the game. I shall later
argue that this position is not as uncomfortable as I have made it
sound, but first a little more needs to be said to clarify the
foregoing.

In particular there is the matter of why there should be a class of 
not practically retractable errors at all. Specifically, why is the
existence of these errors related to the time of detection? The
answer is intuitively obvious, but worth spelling out: it is that
during the delay between the time the error is committed and the
time it is detected, the game goes on. By the time the error is
detected, the game may have evolved to a state which either makes it
very difficult to return to the state of the game at the time the
error occurred, or undesirable to do so, or both. It will be
difficult in proportion to the difficulty or inconvenience of
reconstructing the state of the game at the time the error occurred,
and this difficulty will depend on the number of different kinds of
entities described by the rules, and the complexity of the
relationships between them. And it may be undesirable to return to
the game state at the time the error was committed, not just because
of the practical difficulties involved in reconstructing that state
of the game, but also because the evolved state, including the error,
might now hold some intrinsic interest for the players of the game.
It may be this game state, error or no error, which now holds
interest for them, and from which they now wish to continue the game.

They may, however, feel some disquiet about doing so. For it seems
that to ignore the existence of a retractable breach of the rules,
and continue playing the game regardless, runs counter to every
instinct about why people play games in the first place. That
instinct seems to tell us that respect for the rules of play must be
absolutely paramount; that the rules may not be ignored for the sake
of convenience; that if players do not try to adhere to the rules,
then their activity is without meaning.

This disquiet, although powerful, is misplaced. To forestall
immediate objections, I should add that I don't think there is
anything wrong with the intuitions which drive it. Rather, I think
the disquiet is produced by a failure to interpret broadly enough the
phrase 'the rules of the game', as it appears above in my attempt to
capture our intuitions. In particular, the worry can emerge only if
'the rules of the game' are being thought of as explicitly not
including (some of) the meta-rules for dealing with errors.

An example will help us see thing more clearly. Consider again you
and I, playing chess. Imagine that about ten moves into the game, I
accidentally knock a piece off the edge of the board, and that,
distracted by my thoughts of the game, I absent-mindedly misplace the
piece back on a different square than the one from which it came.
However, so absorbed are we in our contest that neither of us notice
the error -- until, some 30 moves later, you suddenly exclaim "Good
heavens! However did that piece come to be there? You must have
misplaced it back on the board when you knocked it off!" Somewhat
embarrassed, I agree that this must have been what happened. How
ought we to proceed?

If this were a tournament game, with much hanging on the outcome,
then the meta-rules are clear about this situation. The game must be
replayed from the point at which the error occurred. This is the way
in which the bodies which administer tournament chess play respect
the important intuitions I outlined above: by including a meta-rule
like (1), (2) or (3) above in the rules for tournament chess. In
the language I have introduced, we might say that in tournament chess,
nearly all errors are retractable, in practice as well as in theory.

However, in a social game, things may very well go quite differently.
Suppose that you and I are especially interested in the current
position. Then we may agree to play on from that position. The
question is: can a purist legitimately argue that in this case we
are simply ignoring the rules of chess as a matter of convenience
to ourselves? Can she argue that we have, notwithstanding our 
intuitions about the importance of respect for the rules, included
an illegal move as part of our game?

I don't think so. I think instead that we simply play according to
a different meta-rule than the one found in the rules for tournament
play. Instead, we employ a meta-rule for not practically retractable
errors, one which is more appropriate for the context of social play:

(5)  Illegal moves are retracted, unless they go undetected for a
     sufficiently long period. In that case, they are considered
     to have been legal moves.

This meta-rule for dealing with not practically retractable errors
differs from meta-rules (1) to (4) above in a crucial respect: it
mentions move legality. The meta-rules we have considered to this
point have no effect on what constitutes a legal move; they only tell
us how to proceed when the rules have been broken. Meta-rule (5), on 
the other hand, does say something substantial about which moves are
legal: it tells us that if a breach of the rules goes undetected long
enough, then by virtue of its having remained undetected, it in
effect inherits the status of a legal move. A recorder of the moves
of the game would be required to record it as having been a part of
the game.

The effect of this meta-rule, then, is to subtly alter the meaning
of 'legal move' in the game to which it applied. So to the extent
that this meta-rule (or one like it) is accepted for social chess,
the meaning of 'legal move' in social chess is correspondingly
altered. The effect of the alteration is to add a rider to the other
definitions of which moves are legal, one which says that moves which
would otherwise be illegal are legal if the illegality goes
undetected long enough.

The answer to the question of how long is long enough will of course
vary from game to game. It is perfectly possible (although rarely
done in practice), to explicitly include meta-rules in the rules for
a game which answer this question. More often, such rules will be
implicit, perhaps even negotiated among the players when a previously
undetected error is detected. There may well be disagreements among the
players about whether long enough has passed since the time the error
was committed to grant the move, otherwise illegal, the status of a
legal move which meta-rule (5) confers on it. But this is no concern
of mine. Such disagreements may be settled according to whatever
conventions are in place for settling disagreements among players
(the majority decides, or the player most familiar with the rules
adjudicates, or the player providing the materials for the game 
adjudicates, etc), or even according to other rules for settling
disagreements, if such there be. If the disagreement persists and
cannot be resolved, then certainly further play will be difficult,
if not impossible, for the players to undertake. But none of this
poses a threat to the formulation of meta-rule (5) as the right
kind of meta-rule to deal with not practically retractable errors.

There is an obvious objection to my treatment of the not practically
retractable errors, and to my formulation of meta-rule (5) above. 
The objection is to the way in which meta-rule (5) confers legality
on otherwise illegal moves, if they go undetected long enough. To
some, it will seem that this is undesirable, just because it makes
legal otherwise illegal moves, and furthermore that it is unnecessary, 
because meta-rule (5) could be reformulated without mentioning move
legality. Hence the objection is to the effect that the meta-rule for
not practically retractable errors would be better formulated as 

(5') Illegal moves are retracted, unless they go undetected for a
     sufficiently long period. In that case, they are allowed to
     stand, although they are still considered to have been illegal.

Of course, if one agrees that it is preferable not to grant moves which
are otherwise illegal the status of legal moves under any circumstances,
then the above argument will appear compelling. On the other hand,
taking this path forces one to confront squarely the fact that the
non-retraction of a retractable error will entail the incorporation
into the game state of an confessedly illegal move. It is clear that
we are faced with a trade off between on the one hand making some
illegal moves legal (as in meta-rule (5)), with the price that we
weaken to some extent the definition of 'legal move' to include
otherwise illegal moves which go undetected for a sufficently long
period, and on the other hand insisting on maintaining the strength of
whichever definition of 'legal move' is in play (as in meta-rule
(5')), at the cost of occasionally admitting that moves contrary to
the rules were allowed in the course of play. I find this latter
alternative distasteful, although by so saying I concede that the
matter is to some extent a matter of taste. For my part, the central
intuition which I want to preserve intact is the one about the 
conventions for recording moves: that only the legal moves of the
game count as part of the game, and hence that a recorder of the
game should write down all and only these moves. If that means that
we retrospectively grant legality to illegal moves which it would 
be undesirable or impractical to retract, then so be it.

Announcement of a new Contest;

Name:          The Sub-Nomic Contest  (Or: how recursive can we get?)
Contestmaster: Swann



    Contestmaster note:
    This is based on Suber's Initial Set as it appeared Hofstader's book 
    _Meta-Magical Themas_.  I have modified it as little as possible,
    adding the category of Unmutable Regulations (Which are there to
    interface between Daddy Nomic and Baby Nomic, and are defined as
    unchangeable and of absolute precedence-- in the Immutable and Mutable
    Regulations :)

    Any Reg with an asterisk after it has been modified slightly from
    the text of the book, generally to take the e-mail form of the game,
    or the nature of running this as a Contest in the context of a
    larger game, into account.

    I didn't asterisk changes that were simply terminology, which
    amount to the following:

    Regulations = Rules
    Contestants = Players
    Credits     = Points
    Contest     = Game

    (Sorry, there was no elegant way to rename voters and judges)

    Other potential terminology conflicts are dealt with by unmutable
    002.  (Also note the capitalization, or lack thereof, which is to
    further avoid confusion with the larger game.)

O. Unmutable Regulations

000* This contest is a sub-game of Agora Nomic and contestants must
     abide by all rules of Agora in effect.  Any regulation of this
     contest that is inconsistent with the rules of Agora Nomic is also
     void within the Sub-Nomic contest.

001* The entry fee of this contest shall be 5 points.

002* Whenever a term appears in the regulations that ambiguously could
     refer either to Agora Nomic or to Sub-Nomic, the term refers to
     Sub-Nomic.

003* Whenever the regulations state that a contestant has won the
     contest, that player becomes the contestmaster, if e consents.
     If e doesn't consent, the consenting contestant with the highest
     number of credits becomes the new contestmaster.  In case of a tie,
     the old contestmaster chooses a winner and new contestmaster.  When
     a new contestmaster is chosen, the old contestmaster becomes a
     contestant.

004* When a new contest begins, play continues with the regulations then
     in effect.

005* When a new contestmaster is selected, e receives the entire
     contents of the contest fund.  This is the only funds transfer
     allowed out of the contest fund.  After this transfer, no funds may
     be transferred out of the contest fund until a new contestmaster is
     again selected.

006* Whenever a new contest begins, and after the new contestmaster has
     received eis reward out of the contest fund, all contestants must
     put five points (or any currency the new contestmaster deems an
     acceptable substitute) into the contest fund.

007* The contestmaster must post all regulation changes to the public
     forum within 48 hours after the contestants' votes are tabulated,
     and no later than one week after the voting period has closed.

008* The contestmaster must accept any and all transfers into the
     contest fund, from whatever source.

I. Immutable Regulations

101*  All Contestants must always abide by all the Regulations then in
      effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  The
      Regulations in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a contest
      begins.  The Initial set consists of regulations 000-008
      (unmutable), 101-116 (immutable), and 201-213 (mutable).

102.  Initially, regulations in the 100's are immutable and regulations
      in the 200's are mutable.  Regulations subsequently enacted or
      transmuted (i.e. changed from immutable to mutable or vice versa)
      may be mutable or immutable regardless of their numbers, and all
      non-unmutable regulations in the Initial Set may be transmuted
      regardless of their numbers.  Unmutable regulations may not be
      transmuted.

103*  A regulation change is any of the following:
      
        i) The enactment, amendment, or repeal of a mutable regulation.
       ii) The enactment, amendment, or repeal of an amendment.
      iii) The transmutation of a immutable regulation into a mutable
           regulation or vice versa.
      
      No regulation change may affect an unmutable regulation.

104.  All regulation changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted
      on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required 
      number of votes.

105.  Every contestant in this contest is an eligible voter.  Every
      eligible voter must participate in every vote on regulation
      changes.

106*  Any proposed regulation change must be written down and submitted
      to the Contestmaster before it is voted upon.  If adopted, it must
      guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

107.  No regulation change may take effect earlier than the moment of
      the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No regulation change may have
      retroactive application.

108*  The contestmaster shall give each proposed regulation change an
      ordinal number for reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301,
      and each regulation change proposed in the proper way shall
      receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal
      is adopted.

      If a regulation is repealed and re-enacted, it receives the number 
      of the proposal to re-enact it.  If a regulation is amended or
      transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to
      amend or transmute it.  If an amendment is amended or repealed,
      the entire regulation of which it is a part receives the ordinal
      number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.

109.  Regulation changes that transmute immutable regulations into
      mutable regulations may be adopted if and only if the vote is
      unanimous among all eligible voters.

110* Mutable regulations that are inconsistent in any way with some
     immutable regulation (except by proposing to transmute it) are
     wholly void and without effect.  They do not implicitly transmute
     immutable regulations into mutable regulations and at the same time
     amend them.  Regulation changes that transmute immutable
     regulations into mutable regulations will be effective if and only
     if they explicitly state their transmuting effect.

     Regulations in conflict with any unmutable regulations are wholly
     void and without effect.

111* If a regulation change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous,
     paradoxical, or destructive of play, or if it arguably consists of
     two or more regulation changes compounded, or is an amendment that
     makes no difference, of if it is otherwise of questionable value,
     then the other players may debate against the proposal before the
     vote. One week is allowed for this debate, from the time the
     contestmaster submits the proposal to all contestants, after which
     time the vote is taken.

112. The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be changed
     from the achieving N credits to any other state of affairs.
     However, the magnitude of N and the means of earning credits my be
     changed, and the regulations that establish a winner when play
     cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be
     amended or repealed.

113. A contestant always has the option to forfeit the contest rather
     than continue to play or incur a penalty.  No penalty, worse than
     losing, in the judgment of the player to incur it, may be imposed.

114. There must always be at least one mutable regulation.  The adoption
     of regulation changes must never become completely impermissible.

115. Regulations that affect regulations needed to allow or apply
     regulation changes are as permissible as other regulation changes.
     Even regulation changes that amend or repeal their own authority
     are permissible.  No regulation change or type of move is
     impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or
     self-application of a regulation.

116. Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a regulation
     is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
     the regulations, which is permitted only when a regulation or set
     of regulations explicitly or implicitly permits it.

II. Mutable Regulations

201* All contestants begin a new contest with exactly zero credits.

202* Contestants may propose regulation changes by submitting them to
     the contestmaster, who must then distribute the proposed change to
     all contestants for debate.  The contestmaster must submit all
     properly-submitted proposals within a week of receiving them.

203. A regulation change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous
     among the eligible voters.

204. If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the
     contestants who vote against winning proposals shall receive 10
     credits apiece.

205. An adopted regulation change takes full effect at the moment of the
     completion of the vote that adopted it.

206. When a proposed regulation change is defeated the contestant who
     proposed it loses 10 credits.

207. Each contestant has exactly one vote.

208. The winner is the first contestant to achieve 100 (positive)
     credits.

209. At no time may there be more than 25 mutable regulations.

210. Contestants may not conspire or consult on the making of future
     rule changes unless they are teammates.

211* If two or more mutable regulations conflict with one another, or if
     two or more immutable regulations conflict with one another, or if
     two or more unmutable regulations conflict with one another, then
     the regulation with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

     Unmutable regulations take precidence over all other regulations.
     Immutable regulations take precidence over all mutable regulations.

     If at least one of the regulations in conflict explicitly says of
     itself that it defers to another regulation (or type of regulation)
     or takes precedence over another regulation (or type of
     regulation), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical
     method for determining precedence.

     If two or more regulations claim to take precedence over each
     other, or to defer to one another, then the numerical method must
     again govern.

212* If contestants disagree about the legality of a move or the
     interpretation or application of a regulation, then the
     contestmaster must chose a contestant other than the contestant
     alleging the illegal move, or the contestant who allegedly made
     the illegal move, and appoint that contestant as judge.  That
     contestant must then decide the question.  Disagreement, for the
     purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any
     contestant.  Such a process is called "invoking judgment."

     The selected judge has one week to render an opinion.  If the judge
     does not, the contestmaster may rule on the issue eimself.

     The judge's judgment may be overruled only by unanimous vote of
     the other contestants.  Such overturning must be in a proposal sent
     to the contestmaster, and voted upon in the same way as proposed
     regulation changes.  If such a proposal passes, the contestmaster
     chooses a new judge in the same manner as before, with the same
     restrictions.  No contestant may judge the same question twice. If
     there are no remaining eligible contestants to serve as judge, the
     contestmaster must decide the question.

     If the contestmaster issues a judgment, the ruling is final.

     All judgments must be written and submitted to the contestmaster,
     who must distribute them to all contestants within a week.

     New judges are not bound by the decisions of old judges.  New
     judges may, however, settle only that question which e was assigned
     to judge.  All judgments by judges shall be in accordance to the
     regulations then in affect; but when the regulations are silent;
     inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the judge's
     only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit
     of the contest.

213* If the regulations are changed so that further play is impossible,
     or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with
     finality, or if by the judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a
     move appears equally legal or illegal, then the player with the
     most credits wins.  This regulation takes precedence over every
     other rule determining who wins this contest.

This is a good question. Who knows, perhaps I'll join Swann's sub-Nomic 
and find out...

My take on this question is that that Suber's Initial Ruleset contains 
a series of built-in crises which must be faced. Certainly requiring 
unanimous consent for each Rule Change is the first crisis; this will 
only be overcome if the players understand that there is no game otherwise.
Immediately afterwards comes the reward for voting against proposals 
which succeed.

So "fixing" the Suber Initial Set means, for starters, replacing these
two rules.  I do _not_ say that the initial set should be different;
rather, that players in a new Nomic could reasonably focus on how to 
change these. In fact, a flawed Initial Ruleset might be a necessary 
condition for a good game!

I also do not count things necessary to adapt Suber's rules for continuous
e-mail play, for example abandoning the "taking turns" structure, or 
continuing the Game and Ruleset after a win.

Some of the lessons learned in Nomic World and Agora would be valuable 
to incorporate.  These include the following:

1. Some current rules in force in Agora represent hard lessons learned,
   like forbidding a Proposal from rewarding or penalizing on the basis
   of votes cast for that proposal.

   I'm more ambivalent about the "no coerced vote" rule.  Some ways of 
   wording this Rule would have prevented the Group Ordinances from 
   enforcing party discipline.  This might or might not be a good thing, 
   but I'm glad we've had the opportunity to experiment with it, at least 
   in the Reform and X groups.

2. Immutable reform was a way of making the game more flexible.  With 
   no Immutable rules it is possible to completely change the game.

   I doubt that we need the infinitely many levels possible under the
   present system; probably two levels of "Mutable" and "Less Mutable"
   would be sufficient.

3. In Suber's initial set, a rule is renumbered every time it is amended.
   This usually causes it to lose precedence under the conflict rule.
   (Another built-in crisis. Deliberate?)  Our present scheme is one 
   way of fixing this.

4. Our whole scheme of Judgement and Appeals is a fairly stable and 
   consistent one.  From what Steve has said, it was arrived at after
   much experimentation and is the best one he's seen in this game's
   history.  The fact that it has not changed substantially in the
   8 months I've been here is some testimony to its value.  We've 
   consistently resisted Appeal by Proposal, because historically a 
   fair number of the CFJ's involve the Proposal rules themselves!

   Already in Nomic World (see Lindrum's Judgement), the players saw 
   the value of restricting judgement to TRUE, FALSE, and UNDECIDED, 
   rather than allow unbridled judicial activism.

5. Every Nomic has its version of Rule 116 (Permissibility of the 
   Unprohibited).  Agora has Rule 1011 (Game Entities May Not Be 
   Arbitrarily Changed).  Somthing whose value is evident to anyone
   who's been here for a while!  (see the CFJ archives)

None of these involve extra "functionality" except perhaps the Court 
of Appeals.  Killing Immutables and creating "Less Mutables" is a trade
rather than an addition.

Having pointed out all these, I would note that there are things which 
have grown up historically and don't seem to be crucial.

For example, the distinction between "Proposals" and "proposed Rule 
Changes" grew up because the Gamestate includes more than the Rules.
However, it's not logically necessary to maintain a distinction.  
Pieces of the Gamestate like Offices or Patent Titles could perfectly 
well be kept within the Ruleset, and awarding a Patent Title or Office 
could just be another Rule Creation or Amendment.

One other thing that's _not_ part of Agora:  Several other Nomics have 
a rule that goes something like  "No proposal that identifies a Player 
by personal characteristic shall take effect unless that Player consents."
Something to consider, certainly, before removing the unanimous voting 
requirement.

Proto
Fix outdated language

Rule 107 shall be Amended to read as follows:
      Every Proposal must be recorded before being Voted on.  A Proposal 
      which is Adopted must be applied to the Agora Gamestate in the form in 
      which it was Voted on.

Every Rule Change must be recorded before it may take effect.

{Comment:
The language we've got in the current 107 really makes me 
uncomfortable in some places.  Here is 107/0, the current version:

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

For one thing, I dislike the word "any".  I don't particularly like 
"print media" (does that include magnetic media?), and I would rather 
this apply to *all* Proposals, instead of just Proposed Rule Changes.}

Finally, I've gotten around to working on proto stuff again (of course,
I'm staying up all night to do it, but hey.)

Here is the long-awaited Secrecy and Subpoenas (Subpoenae?) Proto.  I
had a lot of trouble with Secrecy, because I realized I wasn't exactly
sure what I wanted out of it.  Eventually I decided on just a definition
of Secrecy, with divulgence "unrequired" except for Subpoenas--so really
Secrecy is just a handy way of designating special cases of Subpoenas.

Proto
Secrecy

The following Rule shall be created:
      Secrecy in Agora is a legal term defining a class of information which
      is not to be divulged.

      A type or information is classified as Secret if the Ruleset designates
      it to be.  The Ruleset may delegate this ability to certain other
      Entities, and may qualify that delegation by limiting the authority to
      declare information Secret to only a few specific type of information.

      No information which is required to be public information (through
      posting to the Public Forum or availability upon request) may be Secret.

      A Player who is in charge of Secret information need not reveal
      that information, except to a Judge who has Subpoenaed it.


Proto
Subpoenas

The following Rule shall be created:
      A Judge or Justice of a CFJ may at any time make a Subpoena on any
      information which is part of the Agora Nomic Game State.  To do so,
      e must tell the Player in charge of that information that it is being
      Subpoenaed.  That Player must then, within 72 hours, send an accurate
      copy of the material to the Judge or Justice who has Subpoenaed it.

      A Subpoena is even Valid and must be honoured for material which is
      Secret or not required to be made public, including (but not limited
      to):

      * Contracts (kept by the Notary)

      * Group Ordinances (kept by that Group's Ordinancekeepor)

      * Current status of Currencies, whether previously published or not
        (kept by various Officers and Viziers)

      * Votes on a Proposal whose Voting Period has ended (kept by the
        Assessor)

      The only part of the Game State which may *not* be Subpoenaed is the
      current tally of Votes on any Proposal still within its Voting Period.

      The penalty for not sending a Subpoenaed material is two Blots.

      If certain information is Secret, it may be used to make a Judgement but
      shall not be published.  The Penalty to a Judge or Justice who reveals
      Secret information as part of eir Judgement is four Blots.  The CotC is
      responsible for reporting this Penalty, unless e is the Judge or Justice
      who revealed the Secret information, in which case it is the Speaker's
      responsibility.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which requires material to be
      kept secret.

Okay, some modifications have been made.  I tightened up GSMs a bit,
and played around with Inertia, setting up defaults and precedences so
the system would work just like it did now.

In another Proposal once this one passed, I would be able to start
defining Inertiae for the other AGSMs currently in the Ruleset, and
fixing things up a bit.

*Ultimately* my goal is to eliminate the distinction between Rule
Changes and other Game State Modifications.  See, if you think about it,
once I have my definitions in place, an Inertia can be defined for any
AGSM or PGSM, and then a Proposal can contain any number of PGSMs, which
change the Rules, or the Scores, or whatever.  Likewise, within the
Ruleset, there can be AGSMs defined which modify EVs or Bits as well as
other Rules.  So, this Proto is "Step 1" in this little project.  Of
course, if only this step in place, everything should *work* exactly the
same.  A little messy, though, since the terminology would be in a
transitional state between "GSM" language and "Proposal/Directive"
language.  (PS: For those of you interested in Steve's non-Proposed
Directives, that's what AGSMs are for. :)

Proto
Proposal/Index Consolidation and Reform

Repeal Rules 594, 993, 955, 1322, and 376.

Create the following Rule, entitled "Game State Modifications":
      Every modification of the State of Agora Nomic, in any way, is a 
      Game State Modification (GSM).  GSMs each fall into exactly one
      of the following categories:
      * Automated GSMs.  Automated GSMs are GSMs which take place without 
        being performed by a person.  They are specified in the Ruleset to 
        occur when certain conditions become true.  AGSMs may only take effect 
        if they are mandated by a Rule with MI greater than or equal to the 
        Inertia of the AGSM.
      * Proposed GSMs.  Proposed GSMs are GSMs which take place upon the 
        adoption of a Proposal.  They can be referred to as GSMs during the 
        Voting Period of the Proposal in which they are contained, but cannot 
        take effect until that Proposal passes, if ever.
      * Manual GSMs.  A Manual GSM is an action by a person (not necessarily 
        a Player) which somehow changes the State of Agora Nomic.  Note that a 
        Manual GSM is almost always the "trigger" for an Automated or Proposed 
        GSM to take effect.

{Comment:
Although not strictly necessary, this poses a convenient way to 
specify certain things elsewhere in this legislation, and can be used 
by all sorts of other types of legislation.  Once this is in place, 
and my redefinition of Power (vs. Inertia), we can eliminate the
distinction between Proposed Rule Change and Directive, both being PGSMs.}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Proposal-Related Indices":
      There is a Voting Index (VI) associated with every Proposal, which 
      represents the support received for that Proposal.  If the Proposal 
      received zero AGAINST Votes, and one or more FOR Votes, its VI is 
      Unanimity.  If the Proposal received zero FOR Votes, its VI is zero.  
      In all other cases, the VI is equal to the number of FOR Votes divided 
      by the number of AGAINST Votes.

      There is an Adoption Index (AI) associated with every Proposal, which 
      represents how much support that Proposal needs to pass.  The AI is 
      calculated once the Inertia of every PGSM contained within the Proposal 
      is known.  The AI is equal to the greatest Inertia Index of all PGSMs 
      within the Proposal.

      There is a Inertia Index (II) associated with every Proposed GSM and 
      every Automated GSM, which represents how much support is required for 
      that GSM to take effect.  The II of a PGSM or AGSM must be at least 1
      unless a Rule specifically says otherwise.  If the Rules are silent
      about the II of a certain GSM, the II for that GSM shall be 1.

      There is a Mutability Index (MI) associated with every Rule, which 
      represents how difficult it will be to change that Rule.  The MI of a 
      newly Created Rule is 1, but may be modified thereafter.

{Comment:
This stuff should be centralized and well-defined.  That's mostly what 
I'm doing here, plus I'm changing Power a bit.  Now, instead of saying 
each GSM has a Power derived from AI or MI, and does or doesn't take 
effect based on that, I say that each GSM has an Inertia based on what 
it's trying to do, from which the AI is derived.  I'm pretty sure this 
removes the circularity.}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Inertiae: A Stopgap"
      The Inertia Index of a Rule Change is the greater of the current MI of
      the affected Rule (if any) and what the MI of the Rule would be if the
      Rule Change takes effect (if any).

      The Inertia Index of any AGSM, except Non-Proposed Rule Changes, is 1.

{Comment:
This is a stopgap, because I don't feel like tackling the MI=3 Rule 105
just yet, at least not as part of this multipart proto--maybe later, once
GSMs have proven their worth.  As for the AGSMs, well, that's really the
way it is now.}

Rules 1052, 1054, and 1416 shall be Amended by replacing occurrences of
      "The Proposal containing such a Directive must have an Adoption
      Index of at least 2."
with
      "Directives of this type have an Inertia Index of 2."

Rules 649, 1044, and 1070 shall be Amended by replacing all sentences
which contain the phrase "Adoption Index" with the following sentence:
      "Directives of this type have an Inertia Index of 1."

Rule 1453 shall be Amended by replacing occurrences of "Adoption Index"
with "Inertia Index".

{Comment:
This fixes up all the Directive types with Inertias. (Inertiae?)}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Proposals":
      Directives and Rule Changes which are contained in Proposals are 
      collectively referred to as Proposed Game State Modifications (PGSMs).  
      A Proposal contains one or more PGSMs.

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which have 
      been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor, and the Voting 
      Index calculated.  If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption 
      Index for a given Proposal, then that Proposal shall pass.  If the 
      Voting Index exactly equals the Adoption Index, then the Assessor 
      shall choose whether the Proposal passes or fails.  If the Voting 
      Index is less than the Adoption Index, the Proposal shall fail.

      A Proposal which passes takes effect at the date and time stamped on
      the first message sent by the Assessor to reach the Public Forum 
      announcing the results of the Voting on that Proposal.

      If a single message sent by the Assessor contains the Voting results 
      on several Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at the same 
      time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.  When a Proposal 
      takes effect, the PGSMs contained therein take effect in the order in 
      which they appear in the Proposal.

{Comment:
This is, essentially, the material currently in 376, 594, 993, and 
955, minus the stuff about calculating AI and VI.}



Proto
Implement GSM language in 108

Rule 108 shall be Amended as follows, and given the title "When May 
GSMs Take Effect?":

      No Automated GSM may take effect earlier than the adoption of the 
      current form of the Rule which causes it.  No Proposed GSM may take 
      effect earlier than the adoption of the Proposal in which it is 
      contained.  A Manual GSM, by definition, takes effect exactly when the 
      person making the GSM executes the action which modifies the Game 
      State.

      No Automated or Proposed GSM may have retroactive application.

{Comment:
Obviously, I would not Propose this until the GSM system was fairly 
well entrenched--I'd like to make sure my definitions work before 
diddling with the immutables.  (Well, not *really* immutable, but you
know.)  This is an almost exact translation of the former 108, though, 
except for the bit about manual GSMs.}

Wow, the listserver has been unusually quiet lately...

Anyway, I have a brief announcement, and a request.

First, I'm working on a perl script to be a CGI script with which to
access the Archives.  So far, I've got it doing queries on the Voting
records, and my ultimate goal for the project is that everything will
tie together.

Now the request: What kinds of queries will you be wanting to make on
the Archives?  Here are the ones I've come up with so far:
List All Players
Voting Records for one Player
Voting on one Proposal
Text of one Proposal
Text of one Rule
Mailing address of one Player
Mailing address of all Players
Text of the Ruleset on a certain date

in no particular order; please mail me with any suggestions, no matter
how outrageous--I have a *lot* of information here, it just needs a bit
of organization.  (I mean, with logs of all listserver mail, I think I
can extract just about anything....)

Not as hard as you might think.  It's just a matter of including a
"data" section with each Rule, containing two dates (when it takes
effect, when it is repealed), and "rule this one replaces", and "rule
replacing this one"....

Actually, if you'll recall, I wrote:

>Text of the Ruleset on a certain date

Like I said, not all that difficult, all I have to do is include the
"startdate" and "enddate" for a given Rule...

How about the amendment history of a paticular rule?  A list of all

- A list of CFJs using a certain Rule as Evidence. Nice if you want to know 
  what people before you judged on comparable subjects.
- History of a certain Rule (all past and later versions), if possible with
  a list of all Proposals (passed or failed) that tried to change it.
- List of Proposals by a certain Player

These are just suggestions, I don't mind if you think it's too much work to
implement it.

That was due to the old "proposed Rule Change" language.  The
Rules specified that "proposed Rule Changes" were to receive
consecutive integers.  I was speaker at the time, and my interpretation
was that since this proposal was not a proposed Rule Change, it
should not receive the number 687 (which was reserved for the
next proposed Rule Change).

As to why you cannot find proposal 687, I do not know.  There
should be one.

Note that the Proposal doesn't have a Title.

The numbering Rule was such at the time that Proposals, could be given
*any* number if they were Titleless.

.net is reserved for service providers.  the obvious form would be

I agree with Vanyel's Opinion as e wrote it -- that Chuck has violated Rule
1454 by attempting to infect a Rule without first selecting a random number,
and that Andre's Judgement, though correct, contained faulty reasoning --
thus you may consider me a cosponsor.

I have a much better idea than to Repeal the Ambassador Rules, or even
to remove the Ambassador's salary....

PROPOSAL
Save Kelly work (if e doesn't want the Internomic proposal)

Directive: Vanyel shall be elected to the Office of Ambassador.

{I am willing to disown this if Kelly actually wants Internomic.}

PROPOSAL
Establish the Internomic

Foreign Policy Directive:
The Ambassador shall endeavour to contact other Nomics and establish
an "Internomic", which is a Nomic for which the entities playing are
other Nomics.

To that end, the following potential initial ruleset for the Internomic
is provided.  Initial discussion regarding the Internomic shall use the
following ruleset, although minor adjustments may be made to it before
the initiation of the Internomic.

Initial Set of Rules for InterNomic
by Don "Vanyel" Blaheta
 
Immutable Rules
 
101.  All Member Nomics must always abide by all the Rules then in
      effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules
      in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first
      game.  The Initial Set consists of rules 101-118 (immutable) and
      201-221 (mutable).
 
102.  Initially, Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their numbers, and rules
      in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their numbers.

103*. A Nomic is any game in which the rules are changeable in some way
      by those entities which play it.  The entities which play this
      Nomic, heretofore called "Internomic", are themselves Nomics,
      heretofore called "Member Nomics".  Every Member Nomic shall be
      either a Voting Member or a Non-Voting Member.  References in the
      Rules to "Nomics" shall mean Member Nomics, and shall include both
      Voting and Non-Voting Members, unless otherwise noted.

104*. At any time, there shall be exactly one Moderator.  The Moderator
      shall be an entity registered as a player of one of the Member
      Nomics.

105*. Every Member Nomic shall have a Liaison at all times.  This
      Liaison must be an entity registered as a player of that Nomic.

106.  The Moderator for the first game shall be {Name}.
 
107.  A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the Enactment, Repeal,
      or Amendment of a Mutable Rule; or (2) the Transmutation of an
      Immutable Rule into a Mutable Rule or vice versa.
 
108.  All Proposals Proposed in the proper way shall be Voted on.  They
      will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number
      of Votes and Quorum is achieved.
 
109.  Every Proposal must be communicated to all Voting Members before
      it is Voted on. If Adopted, it must take effect in the form in
      which it was Voted on.
 
110.  No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the Vote that Adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No Rule Change may have retroactive
      application.
 
111.  The Moderator shall give each Proposal a number for reference.  The
      numbers shall begin with 301, and each Proposal Proposed in the
      proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or
      not the Proposal is adopted.

      If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the number of the
      Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted, it
      receives the number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
112.  Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable rules into Mutable Rules
      may be Adopted if and only if the Votes on the Proposal containing
      the Rule Change are at least 3/4 in favor.  Transmutation shall
      not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a Proposal to
      take effect.
 
113.  In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      Immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that Immutable
      Rule.
 
114.  The state of affairs that constitutes Winning may not be altered
      from achieving n Points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning Points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may be
      Enacted and (while they are Mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
115.  A Nomic always has the option to withdraw from Internomic rather
      than continue to play or incur a game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than withdrawing, in the judgment of the Nomic to incur it, may be
      imposed.
 
116.  There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The Adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.
 
117.  Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that Amend or Repeal their own authority are permissible.
      No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of
      the self-reference or self-application of a Rule.
 
118.  Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.
 
 
 
 
Mutable rules
 
201.  Quorum for a Proposal is defined to be 20% of Voting Members at
      the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.
 
202.  All Nomics begin with 0 Points.  Points may not be gained, lost, or
      traded except as explicitly stated in the Rules.
 
203.  The Winner is the first Nomic to achieve 100 (positive) Points.
      If more than one Nomic achieves this condition simultaneously, all
      such Nomics Win.
      When a game ends in this manner:
        -If there is only one Winner, the Liaison from that Nomic becomes
         the Moderator.
        -If there is more than one Winner, the Moderator randomly selects
         one of the Winners, whose Liaison becomes the new Moderator.
        -All Nomics' scores are reset to 0.
        -A new game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the status
         they had at the end of the old game.
 
204.  A Proposal shall be made by submitting it to the Moderator.  All
      Nomics may make Proposals.  As soon as possible after receiving
      a Proposal, the Moderator shall assign the Proposal a number and
      distribute the Proposal along with its number to all Nomics.

      Every Proposal shall contain exactly one Rule Change.
 
205.  The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal shall be two weeks,
      beginning at the time the Speaker distributes the Proposal to all
      Nomics.
 
206.  Each Voting Member may Vote exactly once per Proposal.  Non-Voting
      Members may not Vote.
 
207.  Voting Members may Vote either For or Against any Proposal within
      its prescribed Voting Period.  In order to be legally cast, the
      Vote must be received by the Moderator by the end of the
      prescribed Voting Period.  The Moderator may not reveal any Votes
      until the end of the prescribed Voting Period.  Any Voting Member
      who does not legally Vote within the prescribed Voting Period
      shall be deemed to have Abstained.
 
208.  At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Moderator shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal.
      If the Moderator's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      Adopted, then the Moderator should indicate at that time whether
      or not e gives eir consent.  If the Moderator does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

209.  A Proposal which would directly alter the actions which are
      required of or forbidden to the Moderator, to which the Moderator
      does not give eir consent, requires a 2/3 majority of Votes
      legally cast in order to be Adopted.

      All other Proposals require a simple majority of votes legally
      cast in order to be Adopted.

      This rule defers to rules which set the required number of votes
      for proposals which propose to transmute a rule.

210.  A Rule Change takes full effect at the moment of the Adoption of
      the Proposal in which it was contained.

211.  A Voting Member receives 10 Points upon the Adoption of any
      Proposal which it Voted against.  A Nomic gains 10 Points when a
      Proposal which it Proposed is Adopted.  A Nomic loses 10 Points
      when a Proposal which it Proposed fails to be Adopted.

212.  If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the Rule
      with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
      that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes precedence
      over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such provisions shall
      supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another or
      defer to one another, then the numerical method again governs.
 
213.  If two or more Nomics disagree about the legality of a move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Nomic may invoke
      judgement by submitting a statement for judgement to the Moderator.
      Disagreement, for the purposes of this Rule, may be created by the
      insistence of any Nomic.  When judgement is invoked, the Moderator
      must, as soon as possible, select a Judging Nomic as described in
      the Rules.  The Moderator must then distribute the statement to be
      judged, along with the identity of the Judging Nomic, to all
      Member Nomics.

214*. When Judgement is Invoked, the Statement shall be Judged by a
      Nomic randomly chosen by the Moderator from all Nomics except the
      Nomic which Invoked Judgement.

      If the Statement must be Judged again, it shall be Judged by a
      Nomic randomly chosen by the Moderator from all Nomics except the
      Nomic which Invoked Judgement, and any Nomic which has already
      Judged the Statement.

215.  After the Moderator has distributed the statement to be judged
      and the identity of the Judging Nomic, that Nomic has two weeks in
      which to deliver a legal judgement.  If the Judging Nomic fails to
      deliver a judgement within this time, it is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A judgement is delivered by
      submitting that judgement to the Speaker, who must then distribute
      that judgement to all players as soon as possible.
 
216.  A legal judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
      judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
      reasons and arguments form no part of the judgement itself.  If a
      judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Modeator
      must distribute the reasons and arguments along with the judgement.
 
217.  All judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement
      to be judged, then the Judging Nomic shall consider game custom
      and the spirit of the game before applying other standards.
 
218.  In addition to duties which may be listed elsewhere in the Rules,
      the Moderator shall have the following duties:
        -register new Member Nomics
        -maintain a list of all Member Nomics and their current scores,
         and make such a list available to all Nomics
        -maintain a complete list of the current Rules, and make such a
         list available to all Nomics
        -make a random determination whenever such determination is
         required by the Rules.
 
219.  If a Nomic believes that the Rules are such that further play is
      impossible, or that the legality of a move cannot be determined with
      finality, or that a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the
      Nomic may invoke judgement on a statement to that effect.  If the
      statement is judged TRUE, then the Nomic who invoked judgement
      shall be declared the Winner of that game, and the game ends.

      This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the
      winner of the game.
      
220*. When the rules of Internomic require that a document must be sent
      to a Member Nomic, the document shall be sent to the Liaison of
      that Nomic.  All actions which are required of a Nomic are
      required of the Liaison of that Nomic.  The Liaison's actions with
      relation to Internomic are determined by the Rules of the Nomic to
      which e is Liaison.

      No entity may be Liaison to more than one Member Nomic.

221*. If more than half the registered players of any Member Nomic are
      also registered players of a larger Member Nomic (larger, in this
      instance, means having more registered players), then the smaller
      Nomic is a Non-Voting Member.

{Rules marked with an asterisk are substantially changed from Chuck's
original email-Nomic ruleset.  103-105 are derived from the original
103; 214 is modified only slightly to allow for Judgements; 220 and 221
are total fabrication, to allow for the vagaries of Internomic.}

Well, participation in a game implies a loss of sovereignty.  Period.  I
mean, I have less "sovereignty" over my own life now--I have to (well, I
don't *have* to, but you know) log in fairly frequently to check mail
and vote and so on.  I also have yielded some control over my disk
quotas; rather a lot of space is taken up by the Archives.  Not that I
am doing this unwillingly, but I am yielding "sovereignty" to
participate in this Nomic.  I expect the same of participant Nomics.  In
any case, I never once visualized Internomic as just another Nomic whose
members happen to be all the members of all the subsidiary Nomics,
because that's all it would be--just another Nomic.

Have you read the proposal yet?  That's exactly how I wrote it up; the
"Moderator" is a player of one of the Member Nomics.  The turn period I
have in there is two weeks, but that is easily changed.

"Considerably different"?  Well, that's arguable.  But yes, the sec-gen
is just a great big Moderator/Speaker type.

I haven't provided for Offices in Internomic, but I envision them
popping up fairly soon.  In any case, the Internomic could theoretically
require our Nomic to require the Players to do things, but if we really
didn't like it, we could just withdraw from the Internomic.

If the Internomic thing goes through, I'd imagine the Ambassador would
have plenty to do--and besides, the post of Ambassador should be a
little more stable than that of Speaker currently is.

	Why's that?  There's no reason we need to be equilateral and 
humanitarian.  If we're a first-world Nomic, it's our duty to guide our 
little-ASCII-brothers toward the path of Truth and Freedom.  If that 
means we have to make a few mandates, so be it.  We cannot shirk the 
duties that God has placed upon our shoulders.  We must be a leader among 
Nomics.

Marks don't lose their utility if they have value in and of themselves,

No way.  A tad too radical.

If all you want is storehouse stuff, I would just as soon have one
centralized, ruleset-sanctioned method of doing so--such as Marks.
Rather than everybody having a Group, or a Contest, or something else to
store their Points.

Boorrrring.  (But better than 2)

Think about this.  I went through the Ruleset looking for all instances
of point awards and penalties:

SALARIES:
1007:X +3 Default
1036:X +3 Promotor
1449:X +5 Assessor
 889:X +5 CotC
 502:X +3 Judge
1051:X +5 Rulekeepor
 417:X +5 Archivist
 901:X +5 Scorekeepor
1436:X +4 Tabulator
1070:X +2 Ambassador
1458:X +3 Notary

PROPOSAL RELATED STUFF:
1061:  +5 New Player Bonus
 659:  -2 Long Proposal
       +1 Short Proposal
       -2 Wide Proposal
1065:  -1 Extra Proposal Fee
1451:  -5 Disowning Fee
 312:X +1 Point for Voting
1443:X +2 Proto Bonus
 833:XF-A Proposal Bonus/Penalty
 947:  +5 Repeal Bonus

JUDICIARY:
1431:  -5 Penalty for Denying a COE later CFJed & TRUE
 951:  -2 Declining a CFJ
1005:  -2 Penalty for going On Hold when assigned a CFJ
 502:  +2 Speedy judgement of CFJ
1448: -10 Penalty for defaulting as Justice

SPEAKER:
 785: -2N Abandoned Speaker
 681: -10 Speaker Transfer
1375: -2N Speaker On Hold
 942:  -T Psychotic Speaker

OTHER:
1023: -10 ASAP Penalty
1064: -10 FOIA Penalty
 840:  -1 Scamster Penalty
 726:Xavg New Player Initial Points
1034:X-25 Mark Purchase
1440:  -5 Blot erasure
1441:X-BL Start-of-Game Blot Penalty
1456: -50 Breach of Contract
1457:  -5 Frivolous Contract CFJ

The ones marked with "X"s are the ones I think should remain as Points;
the others either should become Marks Penalty/Bonuses, Either/or, or are
at least debatable.  In any case it probably wouldn't be all that
difficult to run up one big Proposal (I think it would even be MI=1)
that would make certain things Marks Penalties/Bonuses.

Certainly, anything that is a "Payment" instead of a "Penalty" should be
in Marks, except for the sole and obvious exception of purchasing Marks.

I agree completely.  However, the question is how penalties and bonuses
are awarded.  As a completely radical thought (which just occurred to me
as I was typing this message): Disallow Point transfers completely.
That would mean that each Player would win on the merit of eir own
accomplishments and no other, although business could still be
transacted.

After a little thought, here is a brief protoproto, which I may
formulate into something more formal if there is interest:

* Convert all non-Player Point holdings to Marks at the prevalent rate
  of transfer (presumably 25P:1M).
* Disallow all Point transfers.
* Keep all salaries as Point-based, as well as penalties; convert all
  "fees" (e.g. for multiple Proposals) to Marks
* Institute EOG point-Mark conversion at somewhat less than the
  prevalent conversion rate (say about 40P:1M)
* Modify FOIA to allow for Rules which require payments (in Marks) for
  certain documents.

Other possibilities which would not be immediately incorporated into the
initial Proposal: allow purchase of OoM-type abilities; Powers
(revised); Vototron; deposition from Office; anything else we haven't
already thought of...

Hm.  I can see the reason for stripping down the ruleset, but I was
attempting to use Suber's initial as a jumping off point.  With a little
work I could whittle down my version of the ruleset; I'll work on that
this weekend, maybe.

Urk.  I had been referring to the modification of *internomic* rules;
iow, the methods used by each nomic would be internal to that nomic, at
least for the initial setup of internomic...

See rule 216.  Yes, people can be in multiple nomics, but if one nomic
is largely a subsidiary of another, the smaller can't vote.  (Thus, the
FRC, of which Ronald, Andre, and I are also members, would be able to
vote, but Recursa couldn't.)

Here I must just say that initially, at least, I will assume that
everybody will actually follow the rules.  A radical assumption, I know.

I suppose it isn't really necessary... but it does prevent nomics from
naming third parties as liaison.  Why they'd do that, I don't know...

Look at the second line.  "...must randomly select a member to

As far as I know, only recursa of the existing nomics, but it prevents a
bunch of people grouping into a separate nomic just for extra voting
power.  What it *doesn't* prevent is small groups from several nomics
getting together; of course, the voting dynamics of such a situation
would be so unique it is probably worth it not to bar them.

Well, no I don't. Notice I only said I didn't *think* I'd allow it.
Perhaps I would. But I hope you'll concede at least that it's a grey
area. Consider a couple of examples not too far from Michael's 
(remember we're considering a hyopthetical 683 which requires the
Player to send eir votes to the Assessor). To which of the following
would argument above apply?

1. I decide I'm going to abstain on all Proposals just like Michael
does. But I can't write cron scripts. So, I get Michael to mail me
his script, and I just change the word "Michael" in the signature to
"Steve", leaving the message untouched. Then I run the program. In
that case, I didn't write the message or the script. Would I still be
sending my votes?

2. As above, but I'm even lazier. Instead of getting Michael to mail
me his script, I just ask him to make a duplicate of his script,
(again with the signature changed for convenience), which just runs
automatically whenever his original script does. Am I still sending
my votes? 

3. Someone objects to (2) above, saying that my votes don't come
from my address. Putting aside responses which note the problems
in deciding determinately what someone's address really is (given
that many of us often post from different machines), I ask Michael
modify his cron script for generating my votes so that it sends
my votes via 'my' machine. Does that make a difference?

4. I can no longer be bothered thinking about how to vote, so
I authorize Michael to modify the script he has which generates
my votes in any way he likes, eg so that I vote just like he
does. Now, am I still sending my votes?

Well, in theroy its simple, Recursa having jurisdiction over its own
voting, proposals, etc.  The fuzzy bits only come in at the 
Agora/Recursa interface.  (Theoretically it is currently possible for
a Contestant in Recursa cease to be a Contestant (a legal Agora distinction)
and remain a Recursan (an internal Recursa definition) and still propose
and vote in the Recursa Contest.)

Hmm... I'd implement that a bit differently... or perhaps just change
the "if-then" to "when-do", or something similar; however, selecting an
event-based system is definitely a good choice.  As for Precedence, you
might even rename it "Order", as the higher precedence rules would
evaluate first, and remove the ability of conflicting lower-precedence
rules to do so.

Hm.  As I visualize this, it could be done with a simple .forward file
which pipes incoming mail to the processor, and a cron table which sends
fakemail at the appropriate "schedule pop" times to the processor.

Sounds slick.

Hm.  I'm not too keen on your programming format, although I do agree it
should be kept really simple for the non-programmers out there.  I think
this would be a much easier/simpler/better way of doing the above:

  ObjectNumber: 7
  PrecedenceNumber: 10
  Type: rule
  When: Type == move,
        Subtype == register,
        RegisterName NOT IN Name
  Do: create ( Type: player,
               Name: RegisterName,
               Email: Sender )

Then, as each bit of mail comes in, queue up the queries contained
within, and send each individual query trickling down the ruleset; this
avoids assigning "temporary" objects.

No, since it is an extra-game effect, it would be done when the initial
"REGISTER" query were processed.

Well, I wouldn't even put this in the gameset; this is another thing to
be handled in the "extra-game".

See, to start a query, the processor sets the appropriate variables (in
this case, Type, Subtype, RegisterName, and Sender), then starts the
query trickling through the rules.  Variables may be defined by rules
when they go into effect, or reset if the rule doesn't want
lower-precedence rules to take effect.  The rules keep running, of
course, until no rule intercepts the variables.

This particular rule might be better served by just setting the score
when the player is created.

This would be better than the other way; more likely I would do the
following:

  ObjectNumber: 14
  PrecedenceNumber: 15
  Type: rule
  When: $t = exists( Type == player,
                     Score > 99 )
  Do: Win = true,
      Winner = $t

I use the $ to represent temporary variables, much like your %, but I
prefer $ because it means basically the same thing in perl.

	I see some definite possibilities for abuse, by generating 
infinite loops.  If someone sneaks a rule in that evaluates to true right 
after another one does. . which evalutes to true after the first one 
does.  It will just keep restarting.

rule evaluates to false once, it won't recheck for a particular move.  I 
don't really like this.

many times it's been checked. . if it's something phenomenal, it breaks 
the loop.

	Hmmm.  I like the idea of a formalized rulesystem.  However, that 
doesn't mean that the player input has to be formalized.  You could have 
a player send a message to a designated coder with something like "i 
wanna be a player", and the coder could codify that for the system.  
Similarly, there could be people designated to interpret output for 
non-coder types.  If there is an ambiguity, or a field that the Player 
didn't specify, the coder can discuss it with them.

	Hmm. .but you may want side-effects to happen after a win.  Most
notably, you'd want to notify the Players.  With the above scheme, you'd
just have another ruleobject constantly check the win condition.  If it's
true, do happy things to the gamestate, reset the win condition to 0, and
tell everyone that $t won.  However, i prefer the idea of an separate
object. .the win object, that only acts when its called by another object. 
This object would do all of those happy things when necessary, without
constantly having to check them.

I wouldn't want to use it in lieu of Agora, as the semantic quibbling is

it's done well, I think alot of other groups would be interested.  If you

I prefer the last; especially if there were a designated Coder to spot
this sort of thing.  Perhaps a rule in the extra-game, which stated that
if such an infinite loop starts, the rules are somehow suspended until
it is fixed?

Hm.  There could be a Coder to actually encode the ideas of the other
Players, but as for moves I'd prefer letting the players have direct
input on that, so as not to have the delay inherent in having to send
all moves to a coder before they happen.

Each time a rule is "hit", it has to be checked, and doing as I've
written above would more closely mirror a more conventional Nomic
system.  Once Win == true, some rule intercepts it and does all the
end-of-game things.

This gives me an idea. I don't play FRC, but here's a suggestion
to someone that does: how's about incorporating FRC into Agora as
a Group? Or maybe a Contest? Considering FRC's origins in Nomic World
it seems fitting to me. Even if it were only temporary (maybe make
it a theme for one round of play?), it would give us all a chance to
explore the fascinating issues awaiting us of Groups or Contests not
all of whose Members/Contestants are Agorans. (Since Swann says
Recursa is 'dormant').

Well done, well done!!

I just have a few minor comments:

Relatively early in the game, I submitted a paradox CFJ based on
the fact that "obeying the Rules" conflicted with precedence Rules
which allowed one to not obey the Rule with lower precedence in a
conflict.  The Judge ruled (quite wisely, IMO) that "the Rules" in
Rule 101 referred to the Ruleset as a single entity, and not to
each individual Rule.  Thus, it is not in violation of Rule 101 to
disobey the Rule with lower precedence in a conflict.
(Sorry, I have no idea what the number on that CFJ would be.)

First, you have the CFJ number wrong here; I know it was more recent than 
that!  Second, I thought this was ruled the other way--that a "statement"
did not necessarily mean a statement in the grammatical sense, and
subordinate clauses could be CFJ'd on.  After much
persuasion, I was finally convinced of the error of my ways.

Well, and I'm not going to look through all of the CFJs to find which one

Mmm... I have looked it up. In the Judgement of CFJ 35, as saved in the
Archives, we have:


***Begin of quote from Archives***


The Judge for CFJ 35 shall be:
David Wagner <dgwagner@math.uwaterloo.ca>

{ David Wagner defaulted on 1/10/93 and was replaced by Chuck Carrol
on the same day. }

Judgement: UNDECIDED

-----

Justification:

This is not a statement to be judged TRUE or FALSE (unless the intent
is for me to judge whether the submitter really does request a CFJ
or not ;).  COTC MAY APPOINT JUDGES and COTC MAY NOT APPOINT JUDGES
are not valid Judgements.  Rule 407 states that judgement is invoked
by submitting a statement--*not* a subordinate clause.

The point is now moot, as 367 has been repealed.  If it were not,
I would recommend submitting the CFJ in a more appropriate form.


***End of quote from Archives***

Seems quite clear to me.

Yep!  Anyone who can get the players to vote in a rule that
causes an infinite loop should probably will the game.  That
could be done most easily in the Mechanics, although that's
not a good place for it, since it can't be changed within
the game.  Best solution that springs to my mind is a very
early-precedence rule that counts (using a special counter
the changing of which doesn't reset rule-evaluation) how many
times it's been popped during this event-chain, and launches
a special object when it finds it's been lots and lots.
That special object would then have to cause a win, and all
the results of that Win, without falling back into the
infinite loop.  Which could be tricky!  Anyone causing an
infinite loop in comparatively early rules would probably
have to be awarded a win at the Mechanics level as a
fallback.

Absolutely!  This would be a very very different game from Agora;
Agora brought it to mind as much by contrast as by similarity...

Has anyone considered a formal nomic along the lines of a Prolog-like language?
I.e., a series of productions. I am rather rusty on these languages, but it
might look something like this. Obviously, this is a mere example, and is far
from complete. To express even the mechanism for voting, proposing, and rule
set maintainence would require dozens, if not hundreds, of productions


passes(proposal(p)) := number_of_votes(p,for) > number_of_votes(p,against)
add_to_rule_set(r) := passes(proposal(p)) && is_new_rule_proposal(p,r)
remove_from_rule_set(r) := passes(proposal(p) && is_rule_repeal(p,r)
player_votes(player,proposal,choice) := 
    sends_message(player, i_vote(proposal,choice)


Just something to think about. I have no interest personally in expanding on
this idea. But it seems to me that a prolog-like syntax may be ideal for this.
The Rules would be the productions, and are manipulated by the same logic as
all the other entities. Everything would be completely formal, and the sole
inputs would be the sends_message(player,msg) primitive construct.

I did a little firming-up of my thinking about this, and put
together a simple Initial State.  Apologies for the length!
I'll probably post it to a.g.nomic, also, once the Agoran
Collective Wisdom has had a chance to comment.

Any chance I could get a Thesis out of this?  Or is it
too indirectly related to Agora itself?

A Formal Nomic
--------------

The idea is to have a completely formal game, one in which
there are no rules that have subjective components, or are
otherwise open to disputes about common sense or the
meanings of words.  The game should also be as Nomic-like
as possible, given that restriction, in that the rules of
the game should be represented within, and changeable by
moves of, the game.

This will *not* be Nomic unless we are wildly more
successful than I think we will be.  Because we have to
choose a comparatively simple formal framework (in order
to keep it comprehensible), it's unlikely that we'll
be able to get nearly as "meta" as Nomic can get.
It will also, of course, not have the fun of Judgement
and dispute about word meanings and intent and sense
and reference and all that that Nomics offer.  This
is intended to be a *different* game, albeit somewhat
inspired by Nomic.  But there's no claim that it's
better than Nomic, or truer to any particular ideal,
or anything like that.

There will, of course, have to be an interface between
the formal system in which the rules sit and the players,
who are out in the physical world.  This interface will be
referred to as the Mechanics of the game, and these will
be subject to all sorts of disputes and things.  But they
are *not* part of the game itself; any issues that come up
about the Mechanics ("I didn't make that move; someone must
have forged the e-mail!") will be extra-game issues, and
will not be expressed in the gamestate.

Similarly, the language in which the game is expressed will
be subject to change (and in particular to expansion) as
the game goes on, but this again is an extra-game process.
As new verbs or conditions or whatever are added to the
language, we will just have discovered new parts of the
formal space that the game is exploring.  The status of
the language of the game is not contained in the game
itself (another limitation that Nomic does not, at least
in theory, suffer from).

Details / Examples

The incoming interface is relatively simple: when a piece of mail
comes in for the "server", it's parsed into one or more objects
in the system.  Each object has a Type of "move", a Sender and
Timestamp filled in from the envelope, a randomly-generated
BatchNumber that's the same for all the objects created by the
same piece of mail, and other fields filled in from the body
of the message.  For instance, a request to register might
look like:

   From: Matt Zimola <zimola@peeble.net>
   Date: 14 Aug 1995, 12:36:13 UTC
   Subject: to the Mech server

   REGISTER MattZ

and the corresponding object that gets created might be:

   objectId: 127
   batchId: 114
   moveTimeStamp: 1995/08/14 12:36:13
   moveSender: zimola@peeble.net
   type: move
   subtype: register
   nickname: MattZ

"REGISTER MattZ" is syntactic sugar, to make a common operation
easier.  In its full generality, the incoming Mechanics would
allow the sender of the mail to specify any attributes and values
e wants to (except type, objectId, batchId, and so on).

On the other end, there will be a small set of verbs that
cause extra-game side-effects; primarily mail-sending to let the
physical-world players know what's going on.  But these side-effects
are not defined in or modifiable by the game rules; they are
the Mechanism, not the Rules.  From the point of view of the
game-state itself, the sendFoo() verbs will be no-ops.

A rule is just another object, with Type "rule", an "if"
attribute which is some boolean function of the gamestate,
and a "then" attribute which is some sequence of verbs.
It also has a ruleOrder, to determine which rules get to
look at the game-state first, and probably various other
housekeeping numbers.  (More generally, we can have a
special engineSettings object which would tell the engine
which type of objects are really rules; that would normally
be set to "rule", but could be diddled with for various
special effects.)

The sequence of events in the game is as follows.  Note that
this is again a thing that isn't part of, or changable by,
the Rules, and this is another un-Nomic-like limitation.
It may be possible to make some or all of this stuff adjustable
within the game also; I haven't thought about that very hard
yet.

  - Something happens: either a new object arrives from the
    physical world via the incoming interface, or a rule
    suddenly fires due to a schedule pop.

  - For each object of Type "rule" in the gamestate, in order
    of ruleOrder, the value of the "if" attribute is
    evaluated.  If the result if "false", we proceed to the
    next "rule" object.  If the result is "true", the verbs in the
    "then" attribute fire, creating or deleting or modifying or
    scheduling objects; then we restart this "for" loop, back at
    the rule with the highest (lowest-numbered) PrecendenceNumber.
    (If a rule fires, but the "then" clause does *not* change
    the game-state, we don't restart.)

  - Once the highest-ruleOrder rule has had its "if" part
    evaluate to "false", we go to sleep again until the next
    thing happens.

There are all sorts of "programming" issues involved in making these
things actually work.  When a rule fires and changes the game-state,
for instance, it will almost always have to make sure that the change
it makes is such that it won't fire again for the same reasons, since
its change will cause a restart, and if no rule with a lower ruleOrder
fires, it will see the game-state again just the way it left it.  So
for instance a rule that gives a player a point because of some
condition should make sure to also make the condition false, otherwise
it may give the player an infinite number of points, one at a time!
(Another aspect of the Mechanics will presumably be an extra-Game
meta-rule like "if the game-state goes into a verifiable loop,
the last player to submit a move wins".)

One way to manage this is to have a rule simply delete the object
that caused it to fire; this is sensible in some cases, although it
will often be better to simply mark it in some way (set the
processedByRule47 attribute to T, for instance), rather than deleting
it, so that other rules with higher ruleOrders will get a chance
to act on it as well.

Here's a sample language, Initial State, etc.  It includes
registration (but not deregistration or On Hold), proposals
(which may contain multiple Rule Changes), voting (but not
multiple votes, or changing votes), quorum, simple majority (AIs
and MIs are quite doable, but are not in this Initial State),
points for voting and having your proposals pass, and a simple
Win on points (which ends the game).

I haven't actually *implemented* any of this as a computer program,
and I'm not sure that I have any interest in doing so.  But I hope
it will spur some interesting discussion nonetheless...

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic attributes of objects:
  objectId - a number, used as a handle for talking
     about an object, assigned sequentially by the system
     when the object is created.  Match clauses always
     find the matching object with the lowest objectId.
  type - tells what it is; the incoming interface produces only
     objects of type "move".  The rule engine gets its settings
     from the first objects of type "engineControls", and
     runs only objects whose type is the same as the runType
     attribute of engineControls. All other types have meaning only to
     rules.  A basic type in the initial set is "player".

Move attributes set by the incoming interface (these attributes
are always assigned; any and all other attributes besides Type
can be set by the incoming mail explicitly):
  moveSender - user@host.domain that sent the mail
  moveTimeStamp - yyyymmddhhmmss (a time-format string), from
     the date: line of the mail
  moveBatch - a contentless id assigned to all the "move"
     objects that come in in the same piece of mail (for
     batching up multiple Rule Changes into a single proposal,
     etc)
Except for these three, and type (which is always "move"), the
sender of the mail can control all the attributes of the move object.
Syntactic sugar of various kinds will presumably be provided for
common cases.

Rule attributes used by the engine:
  ruleOrder - rules are run in order of ruleOrder, lowest to highest.
  if - condition tested when a rule is run.
  then - verbs executed when an if is true; if this causes any
     change to the existing objects (creation, deletion,
     amendment), the ruleset is restarted.

Some verbs:
  delete(match) - deletes the matching object (with the lowest
     objectId, as usual)
  create(match) - creates a matching object
  set(match1)(match2) - Changes the object matching match1 so
     that it matches match2.
  send(userid@host.domain[....])(expression) - queues up the value
     of the expression for sending to userid@host.domain (or list thereof).
  sendObject(userid@host.domain[...])(match)(string) - queues up a
     print form of the matching object, with the string for a
     header, for sending.
  sendNow() - actually sends all queued stuff off.

Some functions for use in expressions:
  exists(match)
  count(match)
  timeGE(timevalue) - Tests if the current time is >= the given
     time.  Used for timers.  A possible engine optimization:
     duing each pass, keep track of the lowest-value timeGE
     that fails; set an actual timer to re-check all rules
     at that time, if nothing else has happened in the meantime.

Notes:
  - Some sort of "for" clause in rules may be needed for performance
    and clarity reasons.  Otherwise, the only way to do something
    like sending the entire ruleset to a player in response to a
    query move would be to do <number of rules> passes through the
    first part of the ruleset, using some kludged-up bookkeeping
    attribute or object to keep track of which rules we haven't
    sent yet.  Maybe that's OK?
  - Perhaps allow a rule to say that the engine *shouldn't* restart
    the ruleset after processing it?  That, instead, it should just
    test the rule itself again, and then proceed onwards?
  - A more radical change to this model would be to have all
    object-changes take place in a second, "shadow", copy of
    the object-pool, and switch over to that object-pool only
    when no rule in the current pool wants to make any changes.
    Could be an engineControls switch?
  - Probably be good to have a setall(match1)(match2), that would
    efficiently set all objects matching match1 to match match2.

An Intial State
---------------

Loose conventions about ruleOrder:

  We will use ruleOrder 10000-19999 for rules that don't delete
  the object that sets them off (although they may set some
  attributes so that it doesn't set them off again).

  We will use ruleOrder 30000-39999 for rules that do delete, or
  otherwise make very significant changes (like changes of type)
  to the object that sets them off.

  We will use ruleOrder 99000-99999 for rules that should basically
  only run for cleanup-type reasons at the very end of an event.

It failed.  I wasn't particularly fond of it--obviously, a Proposal
which ties is good enough to *almost* pass, and will almost certainly be
reproposed, thus wasting our time.

So it's a matter of who or what is the tiebreaker.  Currently, it is the
Assessor, which to me seems ok if not great.  I thought about making it
the Speaker, as a sort of reward, but the Speaker already has Champion's
Rights, so this would give em an effective four votes, which is
unacceptable.  In another vein I thought about making a pragmatic rule
which would make it illegal to tie a Proposal.  In other words, the last
person to send in a vote on that Proposal had made it tie, and so would
not be able to vote.  *That* poses some interesting tactical challenges,
but of course it gives the Assessor (who is already overburdened) way
too much work.  Another possibility is something called a Tie-o-tron (or
whatever), which people could submit Marks to, and a vote--it would work
like the Vototron did but wouldn't be considered unless there was a tie.
Another tactical challenge, but of course it is mostly a Mark sink, and
it would have to have a default vote anyway.  (FOR to emulate current
behaviour, AGAINST to emulate Chuck and Kelly's preference.)  It could
be given to the person with the most Kudos to choose, but this is so
often one of the recent Champions, it seems, that this is undesirable
for the same reasons as Speaker's Choice.  (It also has the disadvantage
of delaying the Voting Results.)  Likewise on the person with the most
Points, but of course that person will probably soon be Champion anyway.
YA alternative would be to, if the vote came out as a tie, make the
voting Sane and see if that ties as well (IOW, ignore Groups,
Aristocrats, and EVs--which would, of course, still be cast, just
ignored).  Alternatively, consider *only* EVs, as people who cast EVs
are usually the most concerned with the issue.  The only real problem
with that is that occasionally there is an FA or 2AF vote--they'd just
have to specify which was the EV.  (There isn't a problem with no EVs
having been cast, really--if a Proposal is so controversial as to tie,
someone knows it and will cast EVs.  Plus, this will catalyze people
casting more EVs.)

Well, that's *that* brainstorm, I'll let someone else sort through that
and comment.

nope, sorry, wrong.  i have never written a letter to the editor of
any newspaper.

between august 10th and 17th i was interviewed by three papers (two by
telephone, one in person) and photographed once.  i've also been
interviewed by e-mail for _Wired_.

Not for long--go to almost any store and they will tell you about the
penny shortage.  A few stores in the Chicago area are paying greater
than 1c for pennies, just because they're so unpopular and usually
find their way into pennyjars in people's houses.  In fact, I believe
the last time I used a penny was over four months ago.

Of course, this is entirely irrelevant to what the MUQ of Marks should
be.  Since Marks are now very much tied to Points, and the MUQ of
Points is 0.1, it seems silly for Marks to have an MUQ less than that.
Personally, I wouldn't oppose an MUQ of 1 for Marks, I think it would
make things, in general, to be easier.  (Of course, I'd say the same
thing about Points, too.)

Here are the implementations I said I'd include: 

Implementation section, #1: FTF
301. The players of this nomic are xxxxx, yyyyy, zzzzzz, and wwwwww.
302. Play proceeds in turns; a player has a turn immediately after the
     player on eir left.  A player may only make a proposal when it is
     eir turn.  This takes precedence over a rule which would allow a
     player to make a proposal any other time.
303. The Voting Period begins immediately after the proposal is made,
     and lasts until every player has voted.
304. A player is within the scope of the rules until the game ends or e
     forfeits, whichever comes first.

Implementation section, #2: MUD (hey, I tried to pick two implementation
sections that'd be as different as possible! :)
301. A player is any person with an account on the mud.  They are within
     the scope of the rules whenever they are logged in to the mud.
302. All players may always use all non-Nomic related mud commands,
     including but not limited to movement and socials.
303. To submit a proposal, a player must use the proposal verb to enter
     the proposal.  The voting period commences immediately, and lasts
     one week.
304. To vote, a player must use the vote verb with the number of the
     proposal and eir vote.
305. Votes must be "F" or "A".
306. Proposals, proposal results, disputes, and judgements each have
     their own message board, which will be system-writable only.
307. To submit a dispute, a player must use the dispute verb to enter
     the text of the dispute.  A unique number will then be assigned to
     it.
308. To submit a judgement, a judge must use the judge verb with the
     number of the dispute, then enter the text of eir judgement.

An additional note: 101 would have to have "while they are within the
scope of the rules" appended to it, because of course the scopes are
different depending on the implementation.

Question: would people find this sort of report useful?  Would you
like to see it continue?

Rules 762, 937, and 1506 have recently been repealed.  (It is
my opinion that 1506 was repealed; the fact that the Rule number
was specified indirectly is acceptable.)  The texts and histories
of these Rules at the time of their repeal are below.

======

Rule 762/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Get a Share of the Treasury Upon Leaving

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.

History:
..
Repealed by Proposal 1687, Sep. 1 1995

======

Rule 937/7 (Mutable, MI=1)
Who's Responsible for Currency Changes

      The following classes of involuntary transfers of Currencies
      shall be detected by the Player specified below, within the time
      limit specified, if any.

      * Transfers resulting from the payment of fixed weekly Salaries:
        the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the End of a Game: the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the registration of a new Player or
        the deregistration of an existing Player: the Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the dissolution of a Group: the
        Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the change of Speakership: the
        Scorekeepor;

      * Transfers resulting from the submission of Proposals: the
        Promoter, not later than the message which distributes the
        Proposals;

      * Transfers resulting from Voting upon Proposals: the Assessor,
        not later the message announcing the Voting Results;

      * Transfers resulting from the assignment fees, salaries, or
        penalties to Judges or Justices: The Clerk of the Courts, not
        later than the message which announces the event which caused
        the mandated Transfer;

      * Transfers resulting from penalties or bonus imposed by the
        Rules, when the Rules do not specify another Player to make
        the report: the first Player to detect and report the
        conditions which cause the Transfer to be mandated.

      Other Rules may specify the party required to report a class of
      involuntary transfer not specified in this Rule.

      The specified Player shall report the transfer in question to
      the appropriate Recordkeepors.

(This is probably the form in which this will be proposed, if at all.
 The primary goal of increasing nomic activity seems to have been served 
 just by the threat of proposing this...  I'm still interested in what
 the voting patterns on all of this would be, and which ones would pass.)

 
PROTO: Repeals I (Contests...) 
Rules 1446 and 1515 are hereby Repealed.


PROTO: Repeals I.1 (... & Contracts)
Rules 1455, 1458, 1459, 1456, 1457 and 1499 are hereby Repealed.


{Justification: Contests and Contracts have been around long enough
 and have died out for lack of use.  Even the rabid proponents of
 Contracts haven't done anything to actually *use* the huge body
 of enabling legislation.  I've split the two up since there seems
 to be a dichotomy btween those who favor one over the other.
 1500 can be amended later, if it still exists.}


PROTO: Repeals II (The Assistant.)

Rule 839 is hereby Repealed.

{Justification: The Assistant (as in the Office of) is deadwood. Typo Fixed.}


PROTO: Repeals III (Degrees.)

Rules 1367, 1368, 1369, 1370, 1371, are hereby repealed.

{Justification: Essesntilally little used, but a large block of
 text nonetheless.  If a majority of Players vote for their repeal
 they should be repealed.)


PROTO:  Repeals IV (Protos.)

Rule 1443 is hereby repealed.

(Justification: is needless recordkeeping for only two points.)


PROTO:  Repeals V (Virus.)

Rule 1454 is hereby Repealed.
(Justification: The Virus has enough of a run in its current form.)


PROTO:  Repeals VI (Groups.)

Rules 766, 715, 717, 716, 719, 721, 1514, 1501, 1474, 1397, 1324
      1500 and 718 are hereby repealed.

{Justification: Now I don't expect this one to pass, really.  But
 it does force a referendum on the concept.  Perhaps you may 
 consider exactly *why* you're voting against this one?)


PROTO: Repeals VII (Titles #1.)

Rules 1008 and 1379 are herby Repealed
(Shogun, Honorless Worm, Samourai)


PROTO: Repeals VIII (Titles #2.)

Rule 840 is hereby Repealed
(Scamster)


PROTO: Repeals IX (Titles #3.)

Rule 1047 is hereby Repealed
(Zeitgeist)


PROTO: Repeals X (Titles #4.)

Rules 649, 1044, 755 and 51 are hereby repealed.
(Enabling legislation for titles, and the Champion & Hero title.)


PROTO: Repeals XI (Obey the Rules?)

Rule 101 is hereby Repealed.

(Justification:  None, but there's a continuing debate over the
 so-called redundancy of this Rule.  Are we willing to put it to
 the test?)

PROTO: Repeals XII (Ambassador.)

Rule 1070 and 893 are hereby repealed.

Picture this: a broad class of Corporate Entities, to which multiple
Players may belong, and which may require Players to do certain things.
Contracts, Contests, and Groups would each be special cases of these
Corporate Entities, but a whole lot of code could be consolidated.  (An
interesting thought: one particular instantiation of a Corporate Entity
could be the Jail....)

Actually, Officer's duties are currently at a relative low.  The Banker
and Scorekeepor need only (perhaps "only" is a bad word, but...) record
transfers of Marks and Points, and any Player with a mind to could check
their work easily.  The Herald and Tabulator track WT, Kudo, and Blot
movement.  The Promotor merely distributes Proposals sent to em.  The
CotC distributes CFJs and Appeals sent to em.  The Rulekeepor takes 
new and amended rules and sticks them in eir Ruleset. The Assessor is
the most onerous duty, having to tally people's Votes *and* track EVs
*and* track the Potato *and* track Powers... but I really don't see any
easy way to split up eir job.  In any case, the Officers aren't as busy
as they used to be, for the most part.

That would be cheating, wouldn't it? But as you Americans have
access to the NYT of August 14 (as I remember the date correctly),
and we Europeans the quoted New Scientist, everybody can now be
happy.

Timing problems, again.  "A Player changes eir Party affiliation by
announcing that change to the Public Forum.  That change takes effect at
the beginning of the following Nomic Week."

Please tell me you aren't suggesting that _each Player_ spam the
Scorekeepor with requests after every Voting Period?

Here we have a large overlap of Officer duty.  On the one hand, Parties
are heavily involved with Point transfers, which are the domain of the
Scorekeepor; on the other, they are heavily involved with voting
tallies, which are the domain of the Assessor.  On the third hand (in
Agoraspace, who's to say what I look like?) it would make sense to have
the membership rolls kept by the Registrar.  No matter what there will
have to be communication going on, but what would minimize it?  The
Assessor's already the busiest job, so I'd say the Scorekeepor, even
though that initially seems a bit odd.

"Civic Duty Party"... I like that.

Either the Assessor should detect _all_ Party-based transfers, or none.
I vote the Scorekeepor should do it, as that would seem to minimize
communication.

I hate having the duplicated language, but I really can't see any way
around it.  Oh well.  You might at least shorten the sentences by
folding the "if" part of it into the rest of the sentence, i.e. "At the
end of the VP for a passing Proposal..."  (Makes it easier to read,
too.)

Why exclude the Proposer?  Also, why only one point for FOR votes?
That's just asking for a failing proposal.  Finally, you should fold the
"if" clause into the rest of the sentence.

Ok.  As I see it, the way parties should work is, if a member of any
party voted unintelligently, e would average 1 point per proposal.  That
makes the whole party thing a skill game, in which party to join and
which proposals to vote for and against.  But nobody will join the
progressive or minimalist parties, if their relatively uncommon payoffs
will make them automatically win less than 1 point.

See above, although at least the payoff here is better (I'd recommend 2
for Progressive and 3 for Minimalist, though.)

I agree.  I'd love to see them collapsed, but I really don't see how.

I like them this way.

See above.

Yes.  (This could just be a single letter after their names in the
Scorekeepor's report, or something.  On that note, you might want to
make each party start with a different letter... Civic Duty can be
abbreviated to D, but there's still a namespace collision between
Majoritarian and Minimalist.  Perhaps "Sheep" for the former, or
"Reduction" for the latter?)

At most by two, but probably not even that much... a clever player could
make as much as 12-16 Points per week just for voting, which is more
than salaries... the only other source of Points is Proposing, which I
think should be more valuable than voting.

vanyel, you've compelled me to at least try.

i am going to _attempt_ to work out a variation on my corporations
proto that will support contracts.  it will _also_ support parties.

i'm creating three distinct partitions of all corporations, along
three "axes":

Open vs. Closed:  Open Corporations have public Bylaws, and their
existence is generally known.  Closed Corporations have private
Bylaws, and their existence is generally secret.

Voluntary vs. Involuntary:  Players cannot be forced to join Voluntary
Corporations; they can be forced to join Involuntary Corporations.

Adhesive vs. Non-Adhesive:  Players cannot be made to stay in an
Non-Adhesive Corporation, but can be forced to stay in Adhesive ones.
the term comes from contract law: an "adhesion contract" persists, in
whole or in part, even after the contract has expired or been
terminated or breached.  i've also considered "sticky" and "slippery".

Groups and Contests are both Open, Voluntary, and Non-Adhesive.
Contracts would be Closed, Voluntary, and Adhesive.  Parties would be
Open, and Involuntary, and probably Adhesive (because there are limits
on when you can change Party).

i may find it necessary to create additional partitions, as i work
through the details.

the recent Proposal "A B.N. for favor".

Player Favor, Agora Nomic

Introduction

Historically, many of the scams and CFJs in Agora Nomic
have hinged on matters of word-meaning.  Everyday language
is notoriously ambiguous and dependant on assumptions
about speaker and listener intent that are not logically
well-founded; they require the application of what is
often called "common sense" (a loose and imperfectly-shared
collecion of default assumptions, word-usage rules, and so on).

The Rules and Customs of Agora Nomic have historically
had an ambivalent attitude towards common sense.  Judges
have sometimes been allowed or required to exercise it
when the Rules are not clear.  Some Players have cited the
imperfect consensus on matters of common sense in borderline
cases, and tried to reduce or eliminate the Rules' dependence
on it.

CFJs and scams based on word usage are welcomed and relished
by some Players, and despised by others.  Some have accused
the community of making scams impossible by encouraging
Judges to block them by quibbles on word meaning; others
have claimed that without such quibbles, most scams would
be impossible in the first place.

It would be illuminating to consider what a Nomic game
might be like that was wholely lacking in disputes and
disagreements about word usage and meaning, or about
common sense or other broad subjective notions.  Such
a game would be interesting by virtue of the contrasting
light it would throw on Agora and similar Nomics, as well
as potentially leading to interesting games in its own right.

So

The idea is to design a completely formal Game, one in which
there are no rules that have subjective components, or are
otherwise open to disputes about common sense or the
meanings of words.  The game should also be as Nomic-like
as possible, given that restriction, in that the rules of
the game should be represented within, and changeable by
moves of, the game.

This will *not* be "real" Nomic unless we are wildly more
successful than I think we will be.  Because we have to
choose a comparatively simple formal framework (in order
to keep it comprehensible), it's unlikely that we'll
be able to get as "meta" as non-formal Nomic can get.
It will also, of course, not have the fun of Judgement
and dispute about word meanings and intent and sense
and reference and all that that most Nomics offer.  This
is intended to be a *different* game, albeit somewhat
inspired by the usual Nomic.  But there's no claim that it's
better than any other Nomic, or truer to any particular ideal,
or anything like that.

There will, of course, have to be an interface between
the formal system in which the rules sit and the players,
who are out in the physical world.  This interface will be
referred to as the Mechanics of the game, and these will
be subject to all sorts of disputes and things.  But they
are *not* part of the game itself; any issues that come up
about the Mechanics ("I didn't make that move; someone must
have forged the e-mail!") will be extra-game issues, and
will not be expressed or resolved in the gamestate.

Similarly, the language in which the game is expressed will
be subject to change (and in particular to expansion) as
the game goes on, but this again is an extra-game process.
As new verbs or conditions or whatever are added to the
language, we will just have discovered new parts of the
formal space that the game is exploring.  The status of
the language of the game is not contained in the game
itself.  This is another limitation that nonformal Nomic
does not, at least in theory, suffer from.  I suspect,
however, that a strong case could be made for the claim
that any nonformal Nomic played by humans will in fact
be subject to the same sort of limitation, in that humans,
being finite entities instantiated in a limited universe,
cannot ultimately escape all bounds of language themselves.

Relationship to Agora Nomic

Formal Nomic can serve Agora Nomic as a thought-pump, if
nothing else.  If some actual or contemplated feature of
Agora Nomic would be especially hard or easy to add to
a hypothetical game of Formal Nomic, or would require
diddling with the Mechanics, that says something about
the nature of the feature.  If two apparently-similar
ways of embodying within Agora the same basic idea turn
out to have very different implications for a hypothetical
game of Formal Nomic, that says something about the
differences between them.

Formal Nomic might also be a useful, or instructive,
or amusing subgame (probably a Contest) within Agora
Nomic.  One Player would implement (either automatically,
or by hand) the Mechanics, and choose an Initial Set;
the other Players in the jurisdiction of the subgame
would submit input to the Mechanics, changing the state
of the subgame.  Winning the subgame could mean being
awarded the subgame's Treasury, or whatever.

Details / Examples

The rest of this paper consists of a worked-out example
of one completely formal Nomic, including a description
of the mechanics, and an Inital Set (that is, an initial
object-pool).  It is of course only one example; the
basic objective could be accomplished in many other
ways.  For instance, if all the Players were willing
to be computer programmers, the ruleset and gamestate
could be expressed directly as computer program texts
and variable values, at a considerable increase in power,
and a considerable cost in difficulty of play.

For this example, the incoming interface is relatively
simple: when a piece of mail comes in for the "server",
it's parsed into one or more objects in the system.
Each object has a Type of "move", a Sender and Timestamp
filled in from the envelope, a randomly-generated BatchNumber
that's the same for all the objects created by the same piece
of mail, and other fields filled in from the body of the
message.  For instance, a request to register might look like:

   From: Matt Zimola <zimola@peeble.net>
   Date: 14 Aug 1995, 12:36:13 UTC
   Subject: to the Mech server

   REGISTER MattZ

and the corresponding object that gets created might be:

   objectId: 127
   batchId: 114
   moveTimeStamp: 1995/08/14 12:36:13
   moveSender: zimola@peeble.net
   type: move
   subtype: register
   nickname: MattZ

"REGISTER MattZ" is syntactic sugar, to make a common operation
easier.  In its full generality, the incoming Mechanics would
allow the sender of the mail to specify any attributes and values
e wants to (except type, objectId, batchId, and so on).

On the other end, there will be a small set of verbs that
cause extra-game side-effects; primarily mail-sending to let the
physical-world players know what's going on.  But these side-effects
are not defined in or modifiable by the game rules; they are
the Mechanics, not the Rules.  From the point of view of the
game-state itself, the sendFoo() verbs will be no-ops.

A rule is just another object, with Type "rule", an "if"
attribute which is some boolean function of the gamestate,
and a "then" attribute which is some sequence of verbs.
It also has a ruleOrder, to determine which rules get to
look at the game-state first, and probably various other
housekeeping numbers.  (More generally, we can have a
special engineSettings object which would tell the engine
which type of objects are really rules; that would normally
be set to "rule", but could be diddled with for various
special effects.)

The sequence of events in the game is as follows.  Note that
this is again a thing that isn't part of, or changable by,
the Rules, and this is another un-Nomic-like limitation.
It may be possible to make some or all of this stuff adjustable
within the game also, with some effort.  (Note that that effort
would have to be done outside the game, in the Mechanics, to
enable laters efforts within the game.)

  - Something happens: either a new object arrives from the
    physical world via the incoming interface, or a rule
    suddenly fires due to a schedule pop.

  - For each object of Type "rule" in the gamestate, in order
    of ruleOrder, the value of the "if" attribute is
    evaluated.  If the result if "false", we proceed to the
    next "rule" object.  If the result is "true", the verbs in the
    "then" attribute fire, creating or deleting or modifying or
    scheduling objects; then we restart this "for" loop, back at
    the rule with the highest (lowest-numbered) PrecendenceNumber.
    (If a rule fires, but the "then" clause does *not* change
    the game-state, we don't restart.)

  - Once the highest-ruleOrder rule has had its "if" part
    evaluate to "false", we go to sleep again until the next
    thing happens.

There are all sorts of "programming" issues involved in making these
things actually work.  When a rule fires and changes the game-state,
for instance, it will almost always have to make sure that the change
it makes is such that it won't fire again for the same reasons, since
its change will cause a restart, and if no rule with a lower ruleOrder
fires, it will see the game-state again just the way it left it.  So
for instance a rule that gives a player a point because of some
condition should make sure to also make the condition false, otherwise
it may give the player an infinite number of points, one at a time!
(Another aspect of the Mechanics will presumably be an extra-Game
meta-rule like "if the game-state goes into a verifiable loop,
the last player to submit a move wins".)

One way to manage this is to have a rule simply delete the object
that caused it to fire; this is sensible in some cases, although it
will often be better to simply mark it in some way (set the
processedByRule47 attribute to T, for instance), rather than deleting
it, so that other rules with higher ruleOrders will get a chance
to act on it as well.

Below is a sample Initial State.  It includes registration (but not
deregistration or On Hold), proposals (which may contain multiple
Rule Changes), voting (but not multiple votes, or changing votes),
quorum, simple majority (AIs and MIs are quite doable, but are not
in this Initial State), points for voting and having your proposals
pass, and a simple Win on points (which ends the game).  Kudos,
degrees, Win Tokens, Extra Votes, the Potato, and some other familiar
Agora concepts would fit into this set in reasonably simple ways.

Some other concepts are much harder; for instance, the idea
of sub-rulesets that only apply to some Players, as in Group
Ordinances and Contest Regulations.  Platonic sub-rules are
especially hard to formalize.  For instance, if a Group
Ordinance says that in some circumstances a Group Member
shall transfer fifteen Marks to a non-Member, that's
acceptable.  If it says the opposite, that some non-Member
shall transfer fifteen Marks to some Member, that isn't.
In both cases, both a Member and non-Member appear in the
subrule; formalizing the difference between the two is a
subject for further study.

I haven't actually *implemented* any of this as a computer program,
and I'm not sure that I have any interest in doing so.  But I hope
it will spur some interesting discussion nonetheless...

A note on scams: an amusing proof that scams are entirely
possible in this formal Nomic.  In the first draft of this Initial
State, Rule 16 didn't set the "cleanup" attribute of incoming votes
to F.  So if you submitted a vote, and set "cleanup" to T in the
move object, you'd get your point for voting, but the vote would
be destroyed by the Sweeper, so you could do it again.  And again.
And again.  Getting a point each time, and winning at will.  Easy
to fix, but illustrative!  (In the very first version of Rule 16,
it didn't even have the check to ensure that the proposal ID was
valid, making it easy to win by voting for a hundred non-existent
proposals.)

Anyway:

Basic attributes of objects:
  objectId - a number, used as a handle for talking
     about an object, assigned sequentially by the system
     when the object is created.  Match clauses always
     find the matching object with the lowest objectId.
  type - tells what it is; the incoming interface produces only
     objects of type "move".  The rule engine gets its settings
     from the first objects of type "engineControls", and
     runs only objects whose type is the same as the runType
     attribute of engineControls. All other types have meaning only to
     rules.  A basic type in the initial set is "player".

Move attributes set by the incoming interface (these attributes
are always assigned; any and all other attributes besides Type
can be set by the incoming mail explicitly):
  moveSender - user@host.domain that sent the mail
  moveTimeStamp - yyyymmddhhmmss (a time-format string), from
     the date: line of the mail
  moveBatch - a contentless id assigned to all the "move"
     objects that come in in the same piece of mail (for
     batching up multiple Rule Changes into a single proposal,
     etc)
Except for these three, and type (which is always "move"), the
sender of the mail can control all the attributes of the move object.
Syntactic sugar of various kinds will presumably be provided for
common cases.

Rule attributes used by the engine:
  ruleOrder - rules are run in order of ruleOrder, lowest to highest.
  if - condition tested when a rule is run.
  then - verbs executed when an if is true; if this causes any
     change to the existing objects (creation, deletion,
     amendment), the ruleset is restarted.

Some verbs:
  delete(match) - deletes the matching object (with the lowest
     objectId, as usual)
  create(match) - creates a matching object
  set(match1)(match2) - Changes the object matching match1 so
     that it matches match2.
  send(userid@host.domain[....])(expression) - queues up the value
     of the expression for sending to userid@host.domain (or list thereof).
  sendObject(userid@host.domain[...])(match)(string) - queues up a
     print form of the matching object, with the string for a
     header, for sending.
  sendNow() - actually sends all queued stuff off.

Some functions for use in expressions:
  exists(match)
  count(match)
  timeGE(timevalue) - Tests if the current time is >= the given
     time.  Used for timers.  A possible engine optimization:
     duing each pass, keep track of the lowest-value timeGE
     that fails; set an actual timer to re-check all rules
     at that time, if nothing else has happened in the meantime.

Notes:
  - Some sort of "for" clause in rules may be needed for performance
    and clarity reasons.  Otherwise, the only way to do something
    like sending the entire ruleset to a player in response to a
    query move would be to do <number of rules> passes through the
    first part of the ruleset, using some kludged-up bookkeeping
    attribute or object to keep track of which rules we haven't
    sent yet.  Maybe that's OK?
  - Perhaps allow a rule to say that the engine *shouldn't* restart
    the ruleset after processing it?  That, instead, it should just
    test the rule itself again, and then proceed onwards?
  - A more radical change to this model would be to have all
    object-changes take place in a second, "shadow", copy of
    the object-pool, and switch over to that object-pool only
    when no rule in the current pool wants to make any changes.
    Could be an engineControls switch?
  - Probably be good to have a setall(match1)(match2), that would
    efficiently set all objects matching match1 to match match2.

An Intial State
---------------

Loose conventions about ruleOrder:

  We will use ruleOrder 10000-19999 for rules that don't delete
  the object that sets them off (although they may set some
  attributes so that it doesn't set them off again).

  We will use ruleOrder 30000-39999 for rules that do delete, or
  otherwise make very significant changes (like changes of type)
  to the object that sets them off.

  We will use ruleOrder 99000-99999 for rules that should basically
  only run for cleanup-type reasons at the very end of an event.

i had this idea while semi-conscious this morning.

define agoraspace as an infinite plane (or maybe not so infinite, i
dunno).  probably a lattice is better than a continuous plane.

each player would occupy one lattice cell; more than one player in a
cell is ok.  

cells would have ownerships, and anything that can own currencies can
own cells.  entering an owned cell would require the permission of the
cell's owner (although forcible entry would be a possibility)

unowned cells can be claimed by moving to them and paying a (small)
finder's fee.

certain cells would have "resources" and the owner of such cells would
be able to exploit them in some way.  the exact nature of these
resources would need to be determined.  players could also build
improvements (consuming resources in the process) that would increase
the production of resources in that cell, or perhaps converting one
type of resource into another.

i had the strange idea of having Players emit "energy", and having the
right improvement within a certain radius of a Player would allow you
to collect this energy and convert it to something useful.

anyway, certain resources would yield Marks either directly or through
trade (actually i think Marks would be a resource, roughly equivalent
to gold or something similar).

i have also been meandering over the idea of allowing Players to
purchase Extra Votes with Marks.  my first idea was to have the cost
of the nth EV bought in a given week cost n squared Marks; obviously,
some sort of scaling may be needed to prevent this from becoming
unbalanced.  this would "close the loop", because points would lead to
marks which would lead to extra votes which can lead to points.

Ah, Economy, my fourth favourite subject!
I agree with Favor that we shouldn't introduce scarcity
just to have an economy. Economy is not so much
about scarcity, but more about exchanges of things
that are scarce in one place, but no in another.

So far an economy, by which I think of an frequent
exchange of objects, did not spontaneously develop.
That is, because we value too much the only scarce
objects that we have, i.e. votes.

Votes are rarely sold by Players. It seems that everybody
is happy with having eir One Vote, to influence the game.
It seems to be more important, apparently, that a Player
has *some* weight in the decision proces, rather than that
e bothers to try to increase this weight. (There are exceptions
to the rule of course.)

The point in case is Michael's MVs, who are never ever used.

For this reason an economy around votes could not develop.

Introducing the EVs, didn't really help. Some Players are using
them to double or triple their voting weight, but they are
hardly ever traded. (Although did you notice that 15 EVs changed
hands this yesterday? I wonder what that was about :-)

The conclusion is, obviously, that we yet have to find a scarce
object that will do the trick. Votes don't work: they are not
scarce enough, for people to try to get them by commercial ways.

Maybe, maybe, but so far we never came up with such an valuable
and scarce item.
And the proposals to scarcify (is that a word?) items, that are
now plentiful (like votes), receive a lukewarm reception.
This is not different from what happens with Social Security or
Smoking or Television: once people are hooked, it's hard to
kick the habit.

Nevertheless, the Agora Welfare State -in which Officers
and Judges are paid for by an infinite Treasury, and where
the hard work going into Proposal writing (and thusly,
providing entertainment for the other Players) is rewarded
by the same meaningless Points-  might benefit from some
confrontation with TANSTAAFL!

Imagine that Officers, Judges and Successfull Proposal
Writers were rewarded by Votes. Imagine that you have to
earn the right to Vote.

What would happen?
First of all, Offices would become more valuable and Players
more critical of Officer errors and misbehaviour. When was
the last time that an Officer was kicked out of Office by
a Proposal?
Secondly, Judges have to be more careful: after all, if there
Judgment is overruled that would lose the Votes earned.
Thirdly, Proposal voting behaviour would become different:
not only would a vote lose the Voter a Vote, that could have been
spend elsewhere; but a Proposal would only be accepted, if a Player
feels that e benefits from the particular Rule Change.

Quite a different Agora Universe, isn't it?

That question is of course related to the reason why we play
Nomic rather than hog-belly futures or chess. I like discussion,
the confrontation of ideas and opinions: I drink the Swann-Kelly
exchanges as wodka and the mailsalvos after a Scam taste like
caviar to me.
`Interesting things' that increase my appetite are therefore
welcome.

I wouldn't know: what *are* hog-bellies?

All the recent talk of economics, and scarcity, and "what some people
have but others don't" has made me think about where exactly Agora
players spend man-hours.  Pretty much that gives:
	1. Recording data about the gamestate, and publishing it
	2. Designing proposals to change the gamestate
	3. Reviewing protos and proposals prior to voting
	4. Designing a CFJ
	5. Reviewing the ruleset to judge a CFJ
	6. Reviewing the ruleset with an eye to scamming it
	7. Reading discussion about the above
	8. Writing discussion about the above

So pretty much, at this point, any sort of economy will have to be based
on one or more of the above things.  Currently 1, 2, and 5 are
officially government funded (hehe), while the others are private.
First, some ideas about the currently-private items:
	3. Reviewing proposals.  A possible way of making the economy
	   around this would be for people to pay one of the HP-Players
	   for a detailed analysis of the Proposal, saving themselves
	   time on it.
	4. Writing CFJs.  Well, presumably someone who would want a CFJ
	   would be motivated enough to research it and submit it
	   emself, but I suppose people could be paid to research the
	   truth of a CFJ before it is actually made.  Of course,
	   that's pretty much what 5 does.
	6. Looking for scams.  Obviously, this is its own reward.
	7. Reading discussion.  Since the discussion isn't required, it
	   would be hard to do much with this, although potentially
	   someone could sell copies of an Agora Digest-type document.
	8. Writing discussion.  Obviously, it's own reward.

Now to look at the others: Recording data, Designing proposals, and
Judging.  Well, each of these duties is very important, and paid for by
the government.  We need the Judicial system to resolve things, so
privatizing that would be right out (although it might be possible to
contract out for rule research!)  I can't really see a meaningful way to
privatize proposal design, so that leaves the Recordkeeping and
publishing to be privatized.

Since this is such an experimental idea, we would not want to try and
privatize everything; at first, one Office seems reasonable to explore
the possibilities.  For this, I have chosen the Office of Scorekeepor,
mostly because as things currently stand, *anyone* can keep Score, since
all transfers must be reported to the PF.  So, on with the Proto:


Proto-Proposal DB-Prv1
Privatization, Part I

Rule 721 shall be amended by replacing "inform the Scorekeepor or
      Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate" with "send the
      transfer to the Public Forum or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as
      is appropriate".


Rule 1433 is Amended by removing the sentence "These transfers are to be
      detected and reported by the Scorekeepor".


Rule 1441 shall be Amended by replacing "Scorekeepor" with "Public
      Forum".


Rule 1440 shall be Amended by replacing
      The Player must notify both the Scorekeepor and the Tabulator,
      in the Public Forum, of the number of Blots e is erasing, and
      the number of Points e is spending to do so.
with
      The Player must send to the Public Forum both the number of Blots
      e is erasing, and the number of Points e is spending to do so.

 
Rule 1436 shall be Amended by deleting the following sentences:
      A vacant Office of Tabulator is filled in the usual manner, but
      the Scorekeepor or Herald may not become Tabulator, nor may the
      Tabulator become Scorekeepor or Herald."

  {Why were these even in here in the first place?}


Rule 1489 shall be Amended by replacing "Scorekeepor" with "Public
      Forum".


Rule 1007 shall be Amended by deleting the following text:
      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain
      this sentence.

      The Scorekeepor shall detect and report all transfers resultng
      from the payment of fixed weekly Salaries.

  {Remove the Scorekeepor-detection clause, and disinfect as well}


Rule 1061 shall be Amended by replacing "Scorekeepor" with "Public
      Forum".


Rule 1490 shall be Amended by replacing "Scorekeepor" with "Public
      Forum".


Rule 901 (The Scorekeepor) shall hereby be Repealed.


Rule 1475 shall be Amended to read as follows:
      Points are a Currency for which the MUQ is 0.1.  There is no
      Recordkeepor for Points.  The Mintor for Points is the Mint.

      All transfers involving Points shall be reported to the Public
      Forum.  This takes precedence over any Rule which might not
      require, or which might prohibit, the reporting of a transfer to
      the Public Forum.

  {Removed the Scorekeepor from the rule}

 
Rule 1511 shall be Amended by deleting the sentence which reads "Such
      transfers shall be detected and reported by the Scorekeepor."


Rule 939 shall be Amended to read as follows:

      Responsibility for detecting and reporting score changes
      resulting from a CFJ being judged TRUE is given to the Clerk of
      the Courts, who must post this information to the Public Forum
      As Soon As Possible, and no later than three days after the
      decision of the CFJ.

  {Changed reporting to the PF}


Rule 764 shall be Amended by deleting the last paragraph.

  {New players already show up in the PF, so detecting and reporting is
   unnecessary}

the only problem i can really see with privatizing the scorekeepor
(which is to say, not having any "official" scores) is that it makes
it much more likely for a claim of a win by points to be contested by
a CFJ, and further that judging such a CFJ will be difficult.

why?  as Scorekeepor i have to post score reports at least once a
week.  people have ample opportunity to examine these for errors and
tell me that i fucked up so i can fix it.

without public review of scorekeeping efforts, errors could propogate
and persist for weeks, even months (i anticipate game length
increasing considerably, barring lots of win by tokens).  the chances
are that when a player finally does win, the claim will be contested
(because one of the half-dozen amateur scorekeepors will have a
different total score for that player, one for which the claimant does
not win).  the judge is going to have to sift through potentially
thousands of posts to reconstruct the true scores, and few judges will
have the ability or the desire to do so, and will end up judging
UNKNOWN, leaving us just as confused as before.

other points.  suppose i'm keeping score privately and notice that
some Player has won.  however, being a crafty fellow, i don't mention
this to anyone.  that Player himself either isn't keeping score
himself or has an error in his score tallies that have him not winning
for some reason.  so he doesn't report it either (believing that he
hasn't actually won yet).  eventually, it is found out, say, a month
later, that he actually one a month before.  what is to be done?  this
is somehting of a problem with the current system, but it's not as
severe, because the Scorekeepor is _required_ to announce a Win by
Points within seven days of it happening.

I have results for all Proposals since P.1409 sitting in mail folder,
(I have my old Speaker files from Aug-Sep 1994 in another directory
somewhere) and they reveal this breakdown: 

Proposals       Dates                Assessor

1409-1416       ...    to Feb 01     Vanyel (!)
1417-1533       Feb 07 to Mar 24     Eljefe
1534-1586       Apr 03 to May 15     Steve
1588-1618       Jun 02 to Jul 12     Eljefe
1619-1733       Jul 18 to Oct 10     Steve

So my grip on the vote tallying responsibilities has not been absolute.

What, you might ask, happened to Proposal 1587? That was the anonymous
Proposal. The policy I adopted as Assessor at the time, which still
stands, is that until it can be proven to my satisfaction that this
Proposal was made by a Player, that the results will remain unpublished.

And here are some ideas I've been tossing around to elaborate the
oringinal Wanderer's concept:

* each move, Players may place a single barrier between two squares,
  which prevents movement between those two squares.
* begin with some barriers already on the board (a 'maze').
* allow Players to pay the CF to destroy barriers (increasing the prize pool)
* allow some games to have 'wrapped' boards, so that play takes places
  on a virtual cylinder (by joining just the vertical edges of the board),
  or on a virtual sphere (by joining both vertical and horizontal edges).
* play on a hex board, and vary the size of the board.
* have 'water' squares which cannot be moved onto, placed randomly.
* moves happen in batches, 3 turns per week, at 0000 GMT Tuesday, Thursday,
  Saturday. (This means you make one turn on Sat-Sun-Mon, one on Tue-Wed,
  and one on Thu-Fri).

Basically I envisage a set of variables with which the game can be configured
differently each round. Anyone ever played xbattle? Similar idea.

Here is a revamp of my earlier "fix 107" idea... It was last protoed on
27 May.

Proto
Fix outdated language

Rule 107 shall be Amended to read as follows:
      Every Proposal must be communicated to all Entities who can Vote
      before being Voted on.  A Proposal which is Adopted must be
      applied to Agora in the form in which it was Voted on.

      Every Rule Change must be recorded before it may take effect.

{Comment:
The language we've got in the current 107 really makes me 
uncomfortable in some places.  Here is 107/0, the current version:

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

I don't like the word "any"; I've replaced it with "every".  I don't
like "print media" (does that include magnetic media?) or "written down"
(I can write things down; does everyone see it?).  Furthermore, this now
applies to *all* Proposals and *all* Rule Changes.}

The latter, sort of.
In fact the Great Architect created the world as described in Genesis 1.
But just when He finished writing up His creation in chapter 1 of
His Thesis (the Experimental Set-up) disaster struck.

Human beings became curious and started to investigate
nature. First the GA was pleased with this. But in Middle Ages or so
people on Earth became convinced that the Earth was spherical. The idea
amused the GA and He changed the Flat Earth into a sphere. Just in time,
as it turned out, otherwise Columbus would have fallen of.

But then this guy Copernicus concluded that the earth turned around the
Sun and not the other way around, which forced another change upon the
GA. Next Darwin wanted evolution, which forced Him to deposit fossils
everywhere; then geologist and astronomers wanted the earth to be
4.5x10^9 years old and not the miserable 6600 the GA had needed.

Big Bang, several dozens of elementary particles, floating continents
and General Relativity later the Creation looked quite different from
the original Blueprints.

Then came Schrodinger, his cat and, gulp, Quantum Mechanics.
Here the GA was flabbergasted.

First of all, He didn't understand the theory. After all, He had
an Architects diploma, not one in Theoretical Physics.
Secondly, He started to have enough of these humans who were never
-never!- satisfied with nature as He had created it.

So, He decided to make it all random.
Some physicist let photons fly, to see where they went?
Fine, sometimes they would go here, sometimes there.
Another one, counted nuclear decays. OK, but chances were that
the next one would not come before next week.
Particles were being collided in huge accellerators. No problem,
let them count the pieces, if they wanted.

This new stratagem let the GA have peace, at last, and time to finish
writing up his Thesis. Or so He thought....

Of course, as we all now, Suber came and invented Nomic.

Ok.  Here is the text of the Groups rule, commented by me:

>      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Group.

Well.  It has already been hashed out that this was badly phrased, but I
have a number of ideas on the matter.

1) How would you react if the sentence read "Let there be a type of
Organization known as a Group"?  To me, at least, it clears up the
ambiguity in a way that is consistent with prior play--which seems as
good a criterion as any.

2) Try reading it grouped a bit differently: "Let there be a Class of
(Organization known as a Group)".   It helps, a bit, I think...

3) It seems possible if not obvious that the name "Group" refers to
instantiations of this Class of Organization, or at least that it may
refer to both the Class and the instantiations.  Why is this so
difficult to see?

>     Compact is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as

Perhaps that second comma should be a semicolon, but otherwise this
paragraph seems to unambiguously state the fate of prior Groups--we know
what their Ordinances were, and it says here that the Statutes of Groups
are known as its Ordinances.  Well, that's cleared up.  We know what a
Treasury is, and we know what a Vizier is--now we know that the Vizier
is the Group's Executor.

>     A Group has an associated form of Currency.  The generic name of
>     all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific name of a Group's

This is unchanged, I think.

We know what a Membership is; now we know that it is aka a Jurisdiction.


According to Kelly, an Amend is exactly equivalent to a Repeal-Enact
cycle.  I disagree.  An Amendment modifies a rule, while a Repeal-Enact
replaces it.  More importantly, according to Game Custom, with a
Repeal-Enact there is an infinitesimal time where *the rule does not
exist*.  Providing a discontinuity.  But with Amendment, there is no
such discontinuity.


To provide insight into my point of view, reflect on each of the
following scenarios, and the change in state prior to and following each
example (specifically, what happens to pre-existing and pre-owned entities
of the type being discussed):

1) Players can own various numbers of Puppetheads; the rule defining how
Puppetheads are created is amended to fix a typo.

2) Players can own various numbers of Footsteps; the rule defining how
Footsteps are created is modified so that they are only created once a
week, instead of twice a week as before.

3) Players can own various numbers of Klaws; the rule defining how
Klaws are created is modified so that two people must apply for a
Klaw, instead of one person paying for it.

4) Players can own various numbers of Toupees, which may be Red or
Black; the rule defining Toupees is modified so that there may be Red,
Black, or Purple Toupees.

5) Players can own various numbers of Constantinoples, which can hold
Marks and Points, and each have titles; the rule defining
Constantinoples is modified to rename Constantinoples to Istanbuls
(though other properties remain the same).

6) Players can own various numbers of Spiders, which have many
properties spread out through five different rules; in a consolidation
move those five rules are repealed and in the same proposal, a new rule
is enacted with all the information from the five rules.

7) Players can own various numbers of Fingertips, which have many properties
spread out through five different rules; in a consolidation move the
first of those rules is amended to include all the information from
itself and the other four, and the other four are repealed.

8) Players can own various numbers of Spies, which have many
properties listed in one massive rule; in a diversification move that
rule is repealed and five smaller rules are created which contain all
the info from the big one.

9) Players can own various numbers of Thermostats, which have many
properties listed in one massive rule; in a diversification move that
rule is amended to include only a small portion of that info, and four
new rules are enacted which contain the rest of the info.

I'm playing with a number of variables here, and I'd like you to
seriously consider what happens to the entities held by the players
before proposals 1-9 occurred.

Thought about it?  Here are my "answers" (your mileage may vary):

1) This is the simplest case--according to Game Custom dating back
forever, and almost requisite to a playable game of Nomic, this type of
amendment should not change prior holdings.  People who held Puppetheads
before #1 hold just as many after #1.

2) Game Custom would seem to imply that such "minor" changes as
this--merely a modification in frequency of creation of Footsteps.
Presumably, Footstep holdings would not change as a result of #2--no
need to grandfather the old ones.

3) This is a more "major" change, of course--after #3 passed, there
would probably be people who got Klaws before who couldn't get them
after (at least not as easily).  But, I think, they still hold what
Klaws they have.

4) As a result of #4, a new "type" of Toupee is allowed.  Does this mean
that prior Red & Black Toupee holdings are invalidated?  I doubt it,
although I suppose some people would think so.  IMO, though, people
would keep their old Toupees.

5) The _only_ thing being changed here is the name of the entity
itself--however, I (and I'd guess most others, too) believe that there
would have to be a self-repealing rule to convert Constantinoples to
Istanbuls.  Even though these two things are functionally identical, and
there are even less functional changes than in 2-4 which didn't require
a grandfathering, the name-change is important enough in a continuity
determination that I think a bootstrapping is required.

6) I would say, "well *sure* Spider holdings would remain the same".
Even though the original rule does not exist, at all, in any form--there
are only completely new rules in its place.  I expect there will be much
disagreement on this one, and I am hazy enough on it that I might back
down that position.

7) Just because one rule is only amended, does that change things?  Does
it matter _which_ of the five rules is amended?  I dunno.  I *think*
Fingertip holdings stay the same.

8) Again, none of the original rules exist--does that force a
discontinuity?  Does the _order_ of the RCs in the proposal matter?
There's a debatable question.  I'm inclined to say that Spy holdings
remain, but again that is a tough question. _Why_ do they stay the same?

9) Does merely amending the original rule matter?  I'm inclined to say
it might, but like I said, it's very debatable.  Probably,
Thermostat-holders keep their Thermostats without a grandfather cluase,
and it's somewhat more definite than #8, but still a tad problematic.


SO you see, there are a _lot_ of questions to be resolved over the
continuity of Entity existence.  If I weren't so busy, I'd go for my
M.N. over it, but if anyone else wants to flesh out the topic, feel
free.

Is name important?  I think it is.

Not exactly.  766/2 defined "Groups", and named some properties held by
each Group.  766/3 defines a Class of Organizations, whose instances are
called "Groups", and names some properties held by each such instance.

I see no problem with this--you program in Perl, Kelly, you should be
able to understand the idea of separate namespaces.

Ahem.  See my prior post--naming may not be everything, but it's
important.

So, just because the rules governing _creation_ of an Entity cease to
exist, that Entity ceases to exist?  I postulate the following snippet
of rules:

2101: There exist entities called Accordions.
2102: Accordions are created weekly and given to each Player.
2103: A Player's Accordions are destroyed when a Player deregisters.

Now, if 2102 is repealed, do the previously-held Accordions still exist?
If 2101 is repealed?  If both 2101 and 2102 are repealed but not 2103?
If 2101 never existed, and 2102 were repealed, would the Accordions
still exist?  How much about an Entity must be specified in the Rules
for it to exist?

Individual Groups were Entities under the old Rules.  The individual
Groups have not changed--only the rules which govern them.  (I.e. now
the rules for Organizations as well as the rules for Groups apply.)

It was wrong in any case.  I was just about to get annoyed and go
through the Ruleset to refute the above, when I carefully reread the
rule defining Class II and III transfers... well, it turns out that the
1-Mark transfers were supposed to be Class III and not II, because of
the way I worded the Regulations.  *blush*  Sorry about that; I'm about
to propose to the Contestants that we fix that (well, once the whole
Organization thing clears up), but for now:  REPEAL BOOKIE CONTESTANTS,
PAY ATTENTION: You owe the Contest 6 Marks apiece.  (Except for
Morendil, who I have recorded as "might be a Contestant", not sure about
that.)

From the Repeal Bookie Compact (note the second part of this):
5. When a Rule is Repealed from Agora Nomic, the following shall occur:
   * If any Contestant bet on that Rule, half the treasury is divided
     evenly among all Contestants who bet on that Rule.  Each such
     Contestant must choose a new Rule to bet on.
   * Every Contestant must transfer 1 Mark to the Contest Treasury.

From 1472:
      A transfer which is not required to take place, and which is
      instead the consequence of a Player's action, is initiated by
      that Player, and is a called a Class III Transfer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a Rule, or an Entity other than
      the Rules to which the Rules have granted the power to require
      Players to perform actions, which requires a Player to initiate
      a transfer is _not_ requiring the transfer.  Such a transfer is
      a Class III transfer initiated by that Player.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would require a Player to
      initiate a transfer which is prohibited by this Rule.

In retrospect (hindsight is 20/20!) I should have worded that "One
Mark is transferred from every Contestant to the Contest Treasury".

I might point out that it would be entirely possible to organize a Nomic
Society, which met once a week or so, and the rules continue all week.
That is, you are playing Nomic 24-7 for the duration of this thing.  Of
course, this could be as silly or as serious as you want; if you wanted,
you could enact a rule like "if you see another Nomician in the hallway,
you must jump straight up twice, and thump your fist on your chest", but
if you didn't want to, you could just have rules apply during the actual
meetings.

Ah, what a fun game Nomic can be.  Reminds me of a few rules we had in
the Quasi-Mao game we played in high school.  (See, Mao has so many
rules, and has undergone so many world splits, that a couple of people
at my high school decided to start a new one, called Quasi-Mao,
essentially from scratch.  That was over four years ago, but last I
heard it was going strong, having undergone about thirty world splits
and with each ranging from fifty or sixty to a couple hundred rules...)

I would say no.  The triggering event is the beginning of a Nomic

week either, and no obligation to conduct a Lottery for that week.

Proto-Proposal (MI=1)
Philanthropic Gestures

Create a rule which reads:

   A Proposal is defined to be a Philanthropic Gesture if it is so 
   designated by its Proposer when it is submitted to the Promotor.

   Any score or currency changes regarding formatting penalties, 
   rule repeal rewards, new player bonuses, and awards or penalties 
   for votes cast for such a Proposal are cancelled and shall not be 
   taken into account.  The Proposer does not receive any Extra Votes 
   for a Proposal so designated, even if it passes. 

   This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which would
   otherwise seek to reward or penalize any player based on the
   designated proposal. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reasons:

They had something like this in Thring, I think.  The idea is to 
allow Proposals to make obvious fixes like typos, without Players 
needing to worry about whether the Proposer will get a big F-A Point 
windfall for a trivial Proposal.  I'd probably vote FOR more of these
"typo" proposals if they could be so designated.

The language is lifted from the "Disowning" rule, except that it allows
the Proposal to pass if it gets enough votes, and does not cost 5 points.
Also the designation must be made when the thing is submitted, not later.

This morning, I got email from one Dariush Gholizadeh, wondering if
Agora Nomic would be interested in a business partnership.  I clarified
the nature of Agora (an informal but international association of
people) for him, and he responded with a more clear description of what
he was working on.  Here, then, is his response and my response to it.
(He requested that this be forwarded to you-all.)  In response to my
question about the staff, he stated that young actors will be paid by
his company for the recordings.

Hm.  I kind of like the non-commercial nature of Nomic as it is now,
although if you made those "extras" I don't see the problem.

Well... I really don't think that's necessary.  Personally, I kind of
like email interfacing, with only occasional real-time interaction; at
the pace we're playing (and you can't play at a much faster pace, except
FTF) you really don't need the real-time interaction of video.  Plus, a
lot of people don't have the bandwidth to support that.

Are you saying you have been scouting for a month, or you will be?
Well, anyway, I assume you've found Michael's page; afaik that has all
the known net-nomics.  Try mailing the various servers; would you like
me to forward this to the Agora server?

first of all, i think this idea is somewhat half-baked.  there just
isn't enough interest in Nomic to make such a venture profitable.

secondly, it infringes on Suber's IP rights.  Nomic is Suber's baby,
and anyone who tries to use Suber's Rules to make money is arguably
infringing on his copyright.  someone should get this brought to
Suber's attention (i don't offhand recall his email address).  i doubt
Suber intended for Nomic to be used for for-profit activities, and it
goes beyond the usual permissions to use his ideas for profit without
explicit permission.  

thirdly, it may infringe on our own IP rights.  if Mr. Gholizadeh will
provide a mailing address i'll be glad to put him on legal notice that
he is not permitted to use any of my creative output connected with
Agora for any purpose other than educational or entertainment, and
that such activity must, in any case, be with no intent to make a
profit.  i would suggest that

also note that i do not surrender my IP rights to my efforts here
merely because i am no longer a Player, and that entering into such a
partnership without attempting, at least, to contact every Player,
past and present, who has contributed substantially to the Game (e.g.,
Wes), would be of dubious ethicality at best, and would in theory put
all of us at legal liability.

legal stuff aside, someone should point him at Shattered World, which,
as i recall, ran a Nomic-like "government" within the game, that
Players could elect to become a part of.  Geoff Wong or Mike
McGaughey(sp) would have more information than i would, of ocurse.
Steve may be able to help here, since he knows Geoff and Mike a lot
better than i do. :)

i find the idea of a commericial Nomic unappealing for some reason.
i've thought that it might be nice to incorporate the Friends of Agora
Nomic as a non-profit organization which might then raise funds for
various purposes, but the idea of running a Nomic to make money--for
anyone other than the Players--galls me somewhat.  it's also contrary
to the Spirit of the Game, because the Rules pertaining to payment
would not be subject to being changed by the Players.

i have no interest in fancy real-time conferencing or other glitzy
"cyberspace" junk.  they won't contribute in any useful way to the
Game as i play it.

I'm inclined you guess you're right.  Someone should go ahead and mail him.

And the second of them isn't listed in the summary.  (All other
Proposals are correctly summarised.)

I don't think you can actually COE this.  The proposal was obviously
Numbered improperly, and the Report correctly reflects that.  All you
can do is CFJ that the Promotor violated the Rule (I forget which one)
that states the correct manner of Numbering of Proposals.  Also note
that e only violated that Rule once, not 200+ times.

I'm not sure it does, really; it certainly does in spirit, but I
suspect not in law?  This person could certainly start his own
for-profit Nomic-*like* game, since you can't copyright an idea,
unless Suber's *patented* the idea, which I really doubt.  He
could even call it "Nomic", since you can't copyright a title,
unless Suber's got it as a trademark, which I also really doubt.

He *probably* can't use any significant amount of text from
Agora Nomic itself.  I say "probably" because a case might be
made that by distributing the text in a world-accessible place
sans proprietary notices of any kind, we have effectively
given up some rights; I wouldn't expect such a case to win,
but IP law has surprised me many times in the past!

So while he'd perhaps take some karmic damage from starting
up a for-fee Nomic without Suber's permission, I doubt he'd
be violating any laws, as long as he doesn't (say) include
softcopy of Suber's book...

IMHO, if there are people who are willing to pay money
to this guy to take part in a Nomicy game that he's hosting,
more power to him.  If he does it badly, or no better than
equivalent free games that are available, he'll fail for
lack of customers, anyway.  My initial impression from his
note is that he is several miles from his first clue; on
the other hand, perhaps I'm just not sufficiently
forwardlooking!

I emailed Peter Suber with questions about his rights and preferences with
respect to commercializing his game.  His response is included below.

I no longer have copies of any of the previous discussion on this, so I
haven't the means to provide him with any details beyond the very general
information I've already given him.  Would someone with more details be
willing to relay that information to him?  He seems interested to hear it.

H. Promotor, take note!  This was Proto'd Thu, 2 Nov 95 16:55:01 EST.

Proposal ____, AI=1, proto'd
Recognize Canada

   The present Directive on Foreign Policy Business of the Agora
   Nomic recognizes the nation of Canada as a peer Nomic. The Ambassador
   of Agora is hereby instructed to present official Greetings from the
   Players of Agora to the Citizens of Canada, along with a copy of this
   Directive.

(By popular demand!  Thanks to Morendil for the underlying wording.
 I'm not sure whether to say "Citizens" or "Government" here, since
 the silly Canadians have separated the two; I guess that's what
 happens when you get too many Players.  "Citizens" seems more
 egalitarian and Agora-ish.  The required presentation of Greetings
 could be done, for instance, by a posting to some general
 Canadian newsgroup...)

We are hereby sending a message to the Public Forum as defined by the
Distributor requesting to be Registered as a Player. Therefore, as of
this moment, as per Rule 862, we are now a Player. 

We choose to be identified by the name of Wes, more specifically,
Champion Champion Wes, said Patent Titles having been awarded on Friday,
October 29, 1993 with the passage of Proposal 654 in reward for Winning
the First and Fourth Games of eNomic. 

In the spirit of cooperation, we would like to contribute to the
well-being of Nomic, and so would like to contribute to the Agora
community by holding one of our old Offices, probably either the
Rulekeepor or Registrar, since we are not yet familiar enough with the
new Rule Set to successfully hold the Office of Scorekeepor. If the
holder of either of these two Offices could see eir way to ceed us one
of these Offices, perhaps leaving them with enough time to manage
Scorekeeping, please indicate so to us. 


We are also making a few official requests for information maintained by
an Officer as per Rule 1064. 

  -- We would like to request from the Archivist the records of Proposals 
     773 through the present and all CFJ's to date. 
  -- We would like to request from the Rulekeepor the Numerical Rule Set.
  -- We would like to request from the Promotor a copy of all Proposals
     currently up for Vote. 
  -- We would like to request from the Clerk of the Courts a copy of all
     Calls for Judgements or Appeals currenty being decided. 


Lastly, we would like to invite any Players who wish to cooperate with
us in streamlining the Rule Set or in fixing the lack of definition in
the current Compact/Organization Rules to let us know so that we may
discuss how to proceed on these projects. Also, if anyone would be
agreeable to a temporary suspension of the limits to multiple Proposals,
this process would be considerably easier, faster, and more controllable
by the majority. 

Thank you. 


Enjoy!

We have records of Proposals 301 through 772, and a record of who won
(and when and why) the first six Games of Nomic. We also have some
unsorted digests from the period we are missing, but it seems that
monash decided to stop holding digests while we were collecting and
sorting them, so we're missing many of them.

We will probably be speaking to them about it, but we were the
Rulekeepor when the Office was created. <grin>  And we can also Webify
it. The catch is that we will probably be doing this anyways, so perhaps
people can see the fruits of our efforts and choose between us in an
organized, democratic (being defined as rule by the majority, not
unanimity in this case) fashion.

Acceptable. Can you zip them and send them to us? Perhaps in blocks of
two to three hundred per zip file, since our comm software for the
moment SUCKS. (Anyone have any recommendations for a DOS or Windows term
program?)

We catagorize differently first of all, and second we would like to set
up our old searchable, indexed Rules system which we are used to. We
will probably never use the current categorization system for our own
reference; it's too bulky.

But we need the Number of the Proposal to Repeal each Rule, so we'll
need the text of each Proposal. After all, there are many Rules which
really should be Repealed; we would encourage everyone to compare the
current Rules on the Public Forum to the Distributor Rules; we could
make some CFJ's and probably throw the whole system into chaos. 

We would encourage everyone to actually examine at least some of the
Rules determine if they really serve a purpose in the current Game. Many
of them can and should be Repealed. And again, anyone making blanket
Votes either FOR or AGAINST the Green Repeals will be held in contempt.


Enjoy!

Something went wrong here, sorry. I had deleted them, as I had them in my
mailbox anyway. Then my mailbox got overfull and was saved to a file. And
this file at a certain moment was (in my opinion without any reason) emptied.
So could someone else please do this for me? Thanks.
By the way, I don't think the Rules say I should keep these anyway.

From my list of Stare Decisis:
Rule 478:
CFJ 752 (Judged by Swann, upheld upon appeal by CotC):

Something sent to someone in such a way that that person has the obligation
to send it to all Players is sufficient for it having been sent to the
Public Forum.

(this is my own transcription of the part of the Judgement which is of more
than singular importance).

Now I'm talking about the Stare Decisis-list anyway:

Would the Archivist please forward to me the text (including the Arguments
of the Judges & Justices) of all CFJs from 760 onwards?

Maybe too easy (there was just a Proto to change it) but _that_ is
definitely within the intended interpretation.

To Vanyel on my earlier request for relevant Judgements: From the recently
posted Stare Decisis list I gather that I'm interested in CFJ 764. Also,
if this Judgement was before 113 was amended, I would like to have the
text of 113 at that time.

With a bit of luck, this judgement is on the exact same issue as 764.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

At the very least a delegation of authority needs to be explicitly
intented, if not explicitly stated (though not necessarily to the Public
Forum). Since not even the Player to whom this theoretical delegation
was delegated to was aware of the delegation, it could not have been
delegated.

I agree. How about the following :

a) Non-protoed Proposals are submitted in the traditional manner.
b) When a Proto is submitted, the Promotor replies with a Proposal 
Number. A Proposer may then distribute that Proposal (three to 
fourteen days afterward) with the assigned Number, acting as Honorary 
Promotor.

This would require an amendment to the Proposal Numbering Rule, of 
course. Is there a way to do something like this without amending 
that Rule, and still let a Proposer distribute eir own Proposals 
without significant delay ?

It strikes me that I may have a Blot, having been found

	You're missing the point.  According to Rule 1036 (I think it's 
1036.  The Rule that defines the office of Promotor) Any Proposal 
received by the Promotor must numbered and submitted to the PF.  Once e 
does so, a literalist could interpret this such that e's received the 
Proposal again, and must number it again and resubmit it, ad infinitum.  
I tend to think Game Custom denies this.  Therefore, Game Custom allows 
for Proposals being sent to the PF, while not being submitted.

Sure it is!  A Proposal can contain zero of each.  Remember
Agoran Friendly Thoughts Day?

  PROPOSAL 1701 (Favor) AI=1, protoed
  Friendly-Thoughts Day

  This Proposal contains no Rules Changes and no Directives.

  WHEREAS the growth and well-being of Agora Nomic depends
  critically upon the civility and mutual good-will of its
  Players,

  THEREFORE be it resolved that Friday, September 1, 1995
  shall be an Agoran Friendly Thoughts Day, upon which all
  Agorans may consider the good aspects of their fellow
  Players, and try to find something to admire in even the
  most tenuous scam, the silliest Judgement, and the longest
  thread about the meanings of common words.

See the first sentence of 1483.  It's *very* definite...

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the
      first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable)
      and 201-219 (Mutable).
---

Why should we keep this ?

---
      If for any reason any Player violates a Rule, penalties may be
      assessed as stipulated in other Rules, and the violation shall be
      retracted if possible.
---

This is far less innocuous than you seem to think. It is the very 
first notion I have seen (apart the Injuction on Retracting) that we 
should define when actions are applied to the Ruleset, and when 
they're not.

Apparently, Game Custom has been to do as we goddamn well
please. If it's too much trouble to undo a specific Move (because 
it's been CFJed illegal), then we keep it and sweep the embarrassing 
bits under the carpet. On the other hand, when a strategic Move is 
considered (not even Judged) illegal, a Player with enough political 
power may simply block that Move.

See the Mousetrap for a good example. The Move of its creation was 
immediately subject to doubt, but as the Judicial juggernaut trundled 
on, there was never a real intention to retract it, or keep the Game 
State frozen or whatever. The consensus seemed to be that even if 
MT's creation was illegal, it would *dissolve* upon finding that out, 
not be retroactively un-created.

On the other hand, Swann's election to Notary never really stood a 
chance. It was a totally legal Move, its legality was never contested 
through a CFJ, but Kelly effectively voided that Move by simply 
announcing that she refused to accept it.

Obviously, we can't have that sort of thing. That's despotism. If we 
want to recognize that kind of political power, we want it granted by 
the Rules.

Your new 101 has the effect of all Moves having effect immediately 
and being retracted only if Judged illegal. I submit that we need 
something more flexible, and I will Proto to that effect shortly.

Classes of Moves

Create a Rule with this text (Classes of Moves) :

   A Move is defined as any action taken by a Player, or Entity acting 
   as a Player, that affects the Game State. This Rule defines when 
   and under what conditions a Move in general takes effect, and as 
   such takes precedence over all other Rules.

   There are three classes of Moves.

   Class I Moves take effect immediately, at the time date-stamped
   on the message these Moves are the result of, or at the time 
   specified for these Moves to take effect by the Rules if the Rules 
   do so specify. These Moves shall only be retracted if an Injuction 
   to that effect is issued.

   Class II Moves take effect at the time specified for them to take 
   effect in the Rules, or no later than any subsequent Moves made if 
   the Rules do not so specify. If a CFJ alleging that a Class II 
   Move is illegal is submitted within 48 hours of that Move or that 
   Move's effect (whichever is sooner) being published to the Public 
   Forum, that Move is immediately retracted until the CFJ is Judged. 
   That Move will only take effect if the CFJ is Judged FALSE, and 
   then take effect at the time the Judgement is distributed by the 
   CotC. If that Judgement is Appealed, the Move is again retracted 
   and only takes effect if the Final Judgement is FALSE, at the time 
   the Final Judgment is distributed.

   Class III Moves take effect immediately, at the time date-stamped
   on the message these Moves are the result of, or at the time 
   specified for these Moves to take effect by the Rules if the Rules 
   do so specify. Any Officer to whom a Rule specifically grants 
   authority to retract a particular Move of Class III may do so at 
   eir sole discretion, but must at the same time delegate all futher 
   duties to a willing Player until a CFJ has determined the legality 
   of the Move.

   A Rule defining how a Move is made may in addition specify
   the Class of that Move. Any Move is a Class II Move unless
   defined by exactly one Rule to be of Class I, II or III.
---

Comments : prompted by Vanyel's notes, the Mousetrap Scam,
and my own reflexions on how Agora should handle Moves and
political power in general.

With this, anything that is too problematic can be prevented from 
having effect immediately, while ensuring (after we start adding Move 
Class specs to critical Rules) that important Moves are protected 
from political meddling.

I suggest that the very first Rule to specify a Class III Moves 
should be the Rule specifying how a CFJ is submitted, so that the 
CotC can retract frivolous CFJs made only to block legitimate Class 
II Moves.

that's ok, neither do most native English speakers.  English's formal
grammar, as taught in schools, is neither complete nor accurate.
grammarians are often noted for pedanticism, and many of them do not
"practice what they preach".  the most noted change of recent years
seems to be the acceptance of split infinitives; in the last several
years it has become more and more acceptable to split an infinitive.
the other example off the top of my head of a generally acceptable
agrammatical usage is the placement of a preposition at the end of a
sentence, which is strictly incorrect but incredibly common, and
probably owes to English's Germanic heritage (specifically, the large
number of Germanic verbs with separable prefixes).

Not at all.
The best way is: marry a native speaker of the language you want
to learn and get children. Your spouse will give you the words
and the children will let no opportunity pass to correct your grammar.

I am speaking from experience :-)

Just because more and more people do it wrong, doesn't make it right.

Hmm, isn't that unlikely? German influences on English are much smaller
*now* than they were a century ago.

This doesn't cover all Moves.
The submission of a Proposal does not change the Game State.
Only the submission and the subsequent distribution by the
Promotor does. Argument: if the Promotor forgets to distribute the
Proposal than only the Promotor violates a Rule.
Furthermore: the oversight of the Promotor is a Move as well!

the _best_ way to learn a language, imo, is to spend a great deal of
time around those who speak it, and learning from them.  "immersion"
programs remain the most effective method to teach second languages.
barring that, however, Morendil's approach remains a highly viable
option.

how authoritative of you!  unfortunately, you're wrong.  "correct"
grammar is determined by what is generally accepted usage, not by a
bunch of moldy old men sitting around in libraries gathering dust.  of
course, many grammarians try to resist change in the language, but
inevitably they fail in such efforts.

the United States, at least, experienced a large influx of
Germanic-speaking people during the period between 1850 and 1900, many
of whome settled in the midwest.  their children will have had their
speech patterns colored by their parent's Germanic speech (my
grandmother is a classic example of this).  i suspect that this vector
reintroduced a number of Germanic influences into American English,
especially into the Midwest and Plains States.

i point out that many Minnesotan dialects still show a significant
Nordic influence in intonation and speech patterns, yet it has been
quite a while since a major wave of Nordic immigrants settled there.

hm.  i don't agree with this.  if the submission of a Proposal does
not change the Game State, then the submission of a Proposal has no
significance under the Rules.  but this is clearly not true, so it
_must_ change the Game State.  in fact, the submission of a Proposal
changes the Game State from one state in which the Promotor has no
obligation to distribute that Proposal, to another state in which the
Promotor is.

i think the problem here is not fully recognizing just what is in the
Game State.

No, I think the problem here is not fully recognizing that I might have
a different opinion about just what is the Game State.

IMO it is the collection of documents that the officers produce. Or
rather the Platonic set of data they try to reproduce.

Sender: owner-nomic-discussion@teleport.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: nomic-discussion@teleport.com
Status: RO

needless to say, i don't believe Morendil's categorization of "Moves"
is adequate, and i have distinct problems with eir proposal.

first, it is well-established game custom to, in most cases, allow
Players to make conditional and/or deferred Moves, that may or may not
take place at some time in the (possibly) indefinite future.
Morendil's proposal would take away this ability, by requiring all
Moves to take place in the message describing them.  further
legislation could correct this shortcoming, but i believe it should be
brought forth.

secondly, Moves are not the result of email messages.  Moves _are_
Player Actions.  _Events_, which Morendil fails to define (the major
flaw in his conceptualization), are the results of Moves.  an Event is
any change in a Game Entity, including the creation of or destruction
of Game Entities, as well as changes to any property of existing
Entities (such as possession, location, or anything else that the
Rules might define).  the special case of Players is complicated; i
will deal with that shortly.

in any case, the sending of email, strictly speaking, is not an Game
Event, although some email messages (especially when sent to the
Public Forum) cause Events to take place.  since some Events take
place without any direct causation by a person (for example, the
payment of Officer's Salaries, which takes place automatically,
without any person specifically acting to cause these Events to take
place), there is a distinction between Moves and Events.  

a Move is any action taken by a _person_ (not necessarily a Player,
for a very important reason that will become apparent shortly) which
causes one or more Events (which may occur before, at the same time
as, or after the Move).  i find it easiest to construct the model such
that Moves themselves have no direct effect upon the Game State, but
may cause one or more Events to take place, which then affect the Game
State in some way.  therefore, sending email may (or may not) be a
Move, but it is never an Event: no Game Entity has the ability to send
email.

Moves themselves are not retractable (allowing retractability requires
creating another class of action called a Move Retraction, which
cannot be a Move itself, or a paradox arises), but it may be possible
that other Moves have the effect of nullifying another Move's ability
to cause some Event, and thus the Events resulting from a Move might
be caused to not occur, giving the appearance of retractability.
likewise, no Move is forbidden (in the logical sense) by the Rules;
the Rules have no power to forbid (that is, prevent) persons from
acting in any given way.  the Rules, however, do strictly control the
number, nature, and timing of the Events which occur as a result of a
given Move.

Players, because of their dual nature, both as Game Entnties and as
beings with existence independent of the Game, are confusing.  i have
found that it is best (in terms of the construction of a coherent
theory of Moves) to consider a Player to be a Game Entity "magically"
associated with one (or possibly more than one) person.  this
association is part of what allows a given ecto-Game action to cause
endo-Game Events.  there's at least one case where ecto-Game actions
by persons not associated with any Player can cause an Event, and that
is when a person who is not already a Player registers to become one.
this Move causes a number of Events to take place, the most
significant of which is the creation of the association between the
person and a Player that gives that person the broadened scope of
power to cause Events that characterizes Players.  note that all
persons have some limited power to cause Events; persons who happen to
be Players merely have (significantly) more power to do so.  again,
the Rules have complete control over the ability of Moves to cause
Events.

returning to Morendil's theory of Moves, we can see that it is
incomplete.  the Move of retracting another Move is clearly none of
the classes specified, because a retraction must "reach back" through
time and undo the Events caused by the Move now being denied legal
force; yet, Morendil defines Moves to be Events, and limits their time
to be the time of the email message that caused them, which seems
inconsistent with the inherently retroactive nature of a retraction.
perhaps it can be argued that this rule would be specifying an earlier
time for when the Move of retracting a Move would take place; however,
i am uncomfortable with this characterization of Moves in any case.

also, the Move of taking back a Move is temporally paradoxical: if a
Move is retroactively taken back at some point in the future, so that
it never took place, then how can the Move that caused it to have been
taken back itself take place, referring as it does to a Move that
never took place?  this is why i insist that Moves are inherently
nonretractable.  i believe that allowing Moves to cause Events to take
place temporally prior to when the Move is made (or to deny such
Events from taking place) is not necessarily paradoxical, although
this may lead to the situation where it cannot be determined with
finality whether or not a given Event has taken place.

a consequence of this principle is that "illegal" Moves are possible,
and in fact unregulated.  however, illegal Events are neither possible
nor permissible, and any Move which purports to have caused an illegal
Event simply did not do so.  the making of an Move, regardless of its
legality, cannot cause unpermitted Events to take place.  rather, the
making of an illegal Move by a person who is also a Player causes a
Rule Violation Event for that Player, with whatever consequent Events
occuring that the Rules may define.

the process of Judgement, then, consists of determining what Events
have or have not taken place, and when.  of course, calling for, and
making, Judgement is itself a Move, with consequent (or antecedent)
Events arising thereunto, so the levels become entangled when formal
Judgement is concerned.

sorry for the disjointedness of this essay.  i've been writing it over
the last couple of hours, while also fooling around with a badly
thrashing Linux machine.  my kingdom for another 8 megabytes!

Ding!  My opinion differs only slightly; I view the GameState as the
_information_ contained within those documents.

However, this statement contradicts your prior statement that Proposal
submission does not change the GS, as if we adjourned right now and
there were undistributed Proposals, the Promotor would still have to
distribute them when we resumed...

The Problem:

                Most companies require a pre-employment drug test.
                If you are seeking employment, on probation, or in
                the military, you will have to take a drug test.  

Another Problem:

		Eating the wrong breakfast, or using certain over-the-
                counter pain relievers will falsely identify you as 
                a drug user.

The Real Problem:

		Public and private employers spend 1.2 billion
		dollars each year (1992 figures) on drug tests that 
		are unreliable and inaccurate.  Even hard working
		employees that do not use drugs are at risk.



                                 The Solution:

                       ================================ 


Know the Facts.

        Know what foods and over the counter medicines are routinely 
        mistaken for common illegal drugs.  Simply eating a poppy seed 
        bagel before a drug test can identify you as an opiate user.

        Know how long different illicit drugs can be detected in your 
        system.  Marijuana can be detected for more than a month if 
        nothing is done to conceal its use.

        Know the different types of drug tests, especially the ones
        you are likely to face.  GC/MS tests are almost impossible to 
        beat, but are seldom used.  The more common EMIT test is 
        much easier to fool -- if you know how.

Be Prepared!

        Know when the test is coming.  Do not use illicit drugs, or 
        ingest cross-reactive substances before the test.

        Clean your system of drug metabolites and cross-reactive 
        substances.

        Drink plenty of water and urinate as often as possible before 
        the test.  Do NOT give them your first urine of the day!

Use Clean 'n Clear.


        Clean 'n Clear is a three phase system designed to Clean out 
        your body, so you will give Clear urine and Clear the test.

I am starting to think that this whole "infinitesimal" thing was a
mistake. It creates confusion whether the events actually happen
simultaneously or not. It would be completely clear and simple to have
something like "take place simultaneously, in the order they appear in the
message." Which is probably what was intended in the first place.

It is really not about separable prefixes, there are two distinct issues.
You are referring to

"This is the table, on which I put the book"
(Actually "where" is the usual word here, but I can't think of a better
example at the moment.)

vs.

"This is the table that I put the book on"

I think German, like "formal" English, uses the former, and the latter is 
simply not compatible with modern German syntax. Both languages have 
their syntax heavily influenced by Latin, however (which also uses the 
former.)

In Norwegian it is the former form that is impossible. (Or rather, 
extremely archaic.)

Norwegian does not have separable prefixes - they are always separated, 
like English "look out", "show up", and are used in much the same way as 
in English.

Well, English is hard to classify because it doesn't have a single
evolutionary path, like many languages (French, for instance, is a
totally Romance language, while Dutch is very much a Germanic language);
it originally came from the Germanic language of the Celts; was later
hybridized with the language of the Vikings (Hi, Orjan!), and after the
Norman invasion it received a lot of influence from Norman French.

As a result, we have some of the grammar forms of the Germanic lanugages
(particularly the Celtic family and the Scandinavian family) as well as
influences from the Romance languages (i.e. French).  In the words used,
also, there is influence from both places--in general, for any one word,
you can find a word that means almost exactly the same thing, with the
other derivation.  For example, "horse-jockey" and "equestrian".  Oddly,
in a lot of cases, the Germanic word is considered "base" or "vulgar",
while the Latinate word is considered "proper".  (Well, not *that*
oddly; the nobility of England was French for many years.)  Thus, for
instance, "piss" vs. "urinate"--the latter is considered the more proper
technical term, and you will _never_ hear a doctor or nurse say the
former (at least not in a professional setting).  Silly, isn't it?

There is nothing wrong with the "improper" form, and it really doesn't
fit right in a lot of cases.  You know how I was talking about having an
"ear" for the language?  Well, the form w/o a preposition ending the
sentence just *sounds* wrong in many cases.  Winston Churchill put it
best when he said (and I paraphrase) "That is an error up with which I
shall not put!"

Ahem! "Celtic" is not "Germanic". As far as I know, they are not even 
closest relatives.

Celtic languages: Welsh, Irish, Scots Gaelic, extinct languages of Gaul

Germanic languages:
  East Germanic: Gothic (extinct)
  West Germanic: German, Dutch, English, Frisian
  North Germanic: Old Norse, Icelandic, Scandinavian languages

(I didn't include everything.)

"That is an error with which I shall not put up" would be a bit more sane,
since "up" is not used as a preposition here but as a part of "put up". 
Not completely sane, though.

Moves and Events

Create a Rule with this text (Definition of Moves and Events) :

   An Event is a modification to the Game State. All Events occur at 
   a definite time and take effect instantly at that time. Even if two 
   Events occur at the same time, they take effect one after the 
   other.

   A Move is part or all of an email message. Events occur either as 
   a direct result of the application of one or more Rules, or as a 
   result of one or more Moves.

   An Event that occurs as a result of a Move can occur before, 
   after, or at the time that Move is made.

   Only Moves made by Players are legal, unless a Rule specifically
   describes a case where a non-Player may make a legal Move.

Create a Rule with this text (Principles of Evidence)

   In all cases where a Player must determine whether an Event 
   occurred, only specific Moves or specific Rules shall be cited as
   evidence. This includes, but is not limited to, Calls for 
   Judgement and Official Duties.

   In all cases where there is an uncertainty as to the exact timing 
   of a Move, the following can be cited as evidence, each item in 
   this list taking precedence over the next unless other evidence is 
   supplied that puts its validity in doubt :
    - the time date-stamped on the message itself
    - the time appearing in any Received: header
    - the time when the message was received by the Player citing it 
      as evidence.

Create a Rule with this text (Types of Events)

   There are two types of Events : regulated and unregulated. A 
   regulated Event is one that the Rules only allow to occur as a 
   result of a Move in a particular form. All other Events are 
   unregulated.

   A Move can cause a regulated Event to occur only if it conforms to 
   the specifications of the Rules regulating that Event.
---

Comments : I have for the time being put aside concerns of when an 
Event caused by a Move occurs. There are, as Kelly pointed out, a lot 
of problems with that, and I'd like to know first if the above seems 
valid as groundwork for such legislation.

All three Rules are mainly of the Definition type, but all also 
introduce important principles : ordering of events, rules of 
evidence, grounds for summarily dismissing illegal Moves.

Revision history :
1 - Nov. 10, original proto
2 - Nov. 12
Introduced Events.
Introduced mail messages as the carrier of Moves.
This proto now owes a lot to Kelly. :)

Style Points and the Wizard

Create a Rule with the following text (Style Points) :

   Style Points are a Currecncy. The MUQ of Style Points is 0.5. The 
   RecordKeepor and Mintor for Style Points are theWizard.

   The Wizard shall not create or destroy Style Points except as 
   specified in Rules defining that office. The Wizard is required to
   detect and report all Style Point transfers.

   Only a Player may possess Style Points. A transfer of Style Points 
   is only legal if it is between The Wizard's Treasury and a Player's. If, 
   for any reason, a Treasury belonging to an Entity that is not a 
   Player contains a non-zero number of Style Points, all the Style 
   Points in that Treasury are immediately destroyed.

   At the End of a Game, all Style Points in existence are 
   immediately destroyed, including negative Style Points.

Create a Rule with the following text (The Wizard) :

   There is an Officer known as The Wizard. No Player shall be 
   installed into that Office except as specified in this Rule.

   The weekly salary of The Wizard is 1 Extra Vote, but it is not
   awarded if the Player holding the Office has received an Extra 
   Vote in the previous Nomic Week.

   Whenever a Proposal is Distributed, the Wizard may create up to 3 
   Style Points and cause them to be transferred to the Player who 
   submitted that Proposal, or cause up to 3 Style Points to be 
   transferred from that Player to emself and be destroyed. He shall 
   report that transfer, including reasons for eir decision, to the 
   Public Forum as soon as possible after a Proposal is Distributed.

   The Wizard may not award emself Style Points, i.e. any Style 
   Points e creates must be transferred to another Player.

   After a Game ends, the Player who had the most Style Points just 
   before the End of the Game and was not The Wizard becomes The
   Wizard. In the event of a tie, a Player sshall be randomly selected
   among the Players with the most Style Points and become The Wizard.
   The Wizard is responsible for such  selection and must announce who
   has become The Wizard as soon as possible after the End of a Game.

Directive :

   Morendil's Treasury contains 1 Style Point.

Fixed a few insignificant bugs
Reworded the End of Game changes so that we don't have to wait for 
the Current Game to end. As a result, we have to specify a First

Notice I said 'a class', not 'a Class'. Contests are perfectly valid 
under the current Rules, and nothing prevents me from creating 1000 
of them. I just choose a collective name for brevity.

Too bad  'Creating Contests is not free' didn't pass. :)

There is a difference between:
- transfer all my points to X
- if Y then transfer 5 points to X

The first is very easy to program, while the second forces the Scorekeepor
to check back, whether Y happened, which is a real pain and not programmable.

But in ElJefe's example the condition is limited to the commodity itself,
while in Saltwater's example the condition is external. Quite a difference!

You mean, of course, Rule 494, not Rule 1079. In any case, I disagree
with you that that 1079 makes 494 unnecessary; they do different things.
1079 defines randomness - that is one thing. 494 says the Speaker
makes random determinations if the Rules assign noone else to do so.
That is quite a different thing, and a very sensible safeguard into
the bargain.

I am against repealing Rule 494.

Two points: if "may" is such a terrible word, why have you left it
in the last sentence? Second, you have to watch this "when, if and
only if" stuff. It's simply not true that a Player is deregistered
*only if* they send a message to the PF. They can be deregistered
due to inactivity, for instance. In the future, deregistration might
be considered as a penalty.

Well, it's almost a duty to nitpick this proposal :) So, I should point
out that it's self-contradictory. First it says a Player becomes 
Active if *and only if* e has been On Hold for all of the prior 96
hours etc etc, and then it says "All Players are Active upon Registering."
Without a "however" or something else to indicate an exception to what
has already been set out (as in, eg Rule 452), there a simple conflict,
and worse, no way set out in the Rules to resolve it.

May I suggest the following:

      All Players are either Active or On Hold. All Players are
      Active upon Registering. A Player changes from being Active to
      being On Hold by <blah blah blah>. A Player changes from being
      On Hold to being Active by <blah blah blah>.

I have tried to make such a proto, but stopped as it would be too much
work for little use. There are too many place in especially the Speaker-
transition Rules, where it is quite useful to have a shortcut for 'A Player
other than the Speaker'. It might be an idea to downmutate the responsible
Rule (or part of it) to MI=1, though.

I see a problem here. This Rule is one of the few which take precedence

I think Coren was right to be nice as he was not (only) addressing to the
poster eirself, but (also) to eir administrator or whatever, of whom we are
not sure whether they have any responsibility for or even knowledge of it.

I think you are right about German. As good as my German serves me, I come
to:
"Dieser ist der Tafel, worauf ich das Buch lege."
(For those who don't know a single word German, translation word to word gives:
This is the table, whereon I the book lay."

To add, the situation in my own mother tongue, dutch, is that both are
allowed. One can say both:
"Dit is de tafel, waarop ik het boek leg." en
"Dit is de tafel, waar ik het boek op leg."
The first is completely identical to the German, and apart from the fact that
in a subsidiary sentence the verb is put at the end equal to English. The last
one translates to:
"This is the table, where I the book on lay," so indeed comes close to the
(at least officialy grammatically incorrect) English
"This is the table, that I lay the book on."

After I wrote this I started doubting again. Maybe the second one is not
right after all. But I might be wrong again. Main conclusion is that I don't
know my own dutch grammar after all...

Well, let's see. What if I use another example:
"Here is the man to whom I gave the book."
"Dit is de man aan wie ik het boek gaf." Ok.
"Dit is de man wie ik het boek aan gaf." Ouch! Not even close to sounding
like dutch! So with 'wie' instead of 'waar' it's not split.
By the way, "Dit is de man waaraan ik het boek gaf." is probably incorrect, but
if I heared it I wouldn't notice there was something wrong.

Still the case for not splitting is not very strong, as 'waar' and 'wie' are
not grammatically equivalent:

"To whom did you give the book?"
"Aan wie gaf je het boek?"

"On what did you lay the book?"
"Waarop legde je het boek?" (not split) or "Waar legde je het boek op?" (split)

Doubt, doubt, doubt... Can we split or can't we? We do, that's for sure. And
it can only be done with 'waar' not with 'wie', 'welke' (which), etc.

I look again, and I think it's good after all. Maybe I should just go to the
library and take a book on dutch grammar...

By the way, now we're talking about these kinds of languages anyway, my father
is bilingual since about 2 weeks. The dutch gouvernment (or was it the EEC?)
has officially accepted Nedersaksisch (Ger.: Niedersachsisch, it translates
into English as Lower Saxon) as a minority language. It consists of the
dialects spoken in the northeastern of the Netherlands and northern Germany.

This Dissenting Opinion remains unofficial for the time being. For
now, I just want to note that Justice Michael's Judgement is wrong
in at least two places.

Firstly, he has misunderstood the role that R.116 plays in the debate.
Although it is true, as Justice Morendil correctly points out, that
R.116 governs all play and all situations to which its language makes
it relevant, this is not needed in the argument that CFJ 818 is FALSE.
R.116 does not govern the Jurisdictions of Compacts of Organizations
of undefined Class just because it governs all play generally. It does
so because the expansion is 'unprohibited and unregulated', and so is
spoken to directly by the language of R.116.

Secondly, Justice Michael totally ignores the effect of R.1535(iii):

      The Compact of an Organization can specify any or all of the
      following.

      iii) How additional Players enter the Jurisdiction of the
           Compact.  If this is not specified, the Compact cannot
           expand its Jurisdiction.

This serves to strengthen the notion that the expansion of the
Jurisdiction is unprohibited and unregulated, by making it clear
that such an expansion is possible to the extent permitted by
the Rules.

Boy, is *that* strange!  Certainly there was once a Rule defining
the Office?  In the absence of one in the current Ruleset, perhaps
Rule 1473/0's first use of "Banker" should be taken as definitive
rather than descriptive, although the "in eir absence" clause
makes that tough.  Even if we do that, of course, we still have
to figure out who the Recordkeepor for Marks is...   *8)

Obviously it's not the speaker voter distinction that makes the speaker immune
(since the speaker _is_ a voter, everywhere but in the language to the ruleset)
Waht makes eim immune (or should make em immune) ius the fact e's speaker.

Someone is going to pass a rule applying to "all voters" and leave the
Speaker out in the cold one of these days. . .

I have looked, and not found it. I think we must draw the conclusion
that Banker is NOT an Office at the moment. Neither is it regulated who is
the Banker, or how this is changed.

That sounds good to me.  Fixing the Rules should be relatively

It seems to me that you are right: several Rules describing what the
the Banker is supposed to do, but no Rule declaring eim an Officer.

However, there exist a Rule stating that the Banker has to publish
"an Official Document" every so often.

And, from the rule itself, if the Banker is gone through some ruleset snafu,
the wording transferes the Recordkeeping to the Speaker, so Marks do not
 dissapear (and for the last few months the Office has been filled by the 
right pwerson, for the wrong reasons.)

And why would the abscence of a Banker affect points?

Specify, yes, but no Rule saying the Banker is an Officer.
Hence, no way to replace eim, no reason why the Speaker should du
the Banker's work.

I doubt it...
A message to the PF announcing the transfer of a currency to
another Player, or any Official Message of the Speaker (like:
I transfered all my files to the Elect) is an Official document too.

But it doesn't necessarily promote that Player or the Speaker to
Officer.

I disagree with this extra paragraph.  IMO, just because an illegal
move is retractable does not mean it should be retracted.  For
many illegal moves, particularly accidental ones, retracting the
move causes more difficulty than leaving it in place.

BTW, thanks for all the Rule histories.  I'll add them when I

This event soes show one thing: We can have
a productive currency that is at the same
time non-existent (as far as the Rules are
concerned) *as long as we don't know that*
Now can we have such a currency if we do?
I propose we keep things as they are, and
not fix the banker thing.
  After all, 116 allows us to transfer these
virtual Marks, etc. The various Marks
penalties, etc. can also be paid (since
if the Rules demand virtual currency, virtual currency must be paid).
 As for a "recordkeepor", we could, by consensus, parallel
the system used by other, real, Offices.
The only problem is how to prevent wholesale
creation of virtual Marks. With regard to
transfers between Players, that is no problem:
don't trade with Players who do so. When dealing
with the Game (i.e. buying Powers), we have a
bit of a problem. Could we ignore player-generated
Marks by interpreting the Rules only to refer to
Game-generated Marks (since that is Game custom)?
I'd be interested to hear any other ideas.

It was originally conceived when, during the FUN period of Nomic (when
PROSIRUP reigned (the PRoposers Of SIlly RUles Party) and we had a Rule
which specified how one must address the Speaker. First came: 

342.  Showing proper respect for the Speaker
      All future references to the Speaker shall refer to the Speaker as
      the "Mighty Speaker", the "Benevolent Speaker", or as the
      "Benevolent Mighty Speaker". Any Player who refers to the Mighty
      Speaker without using these respectful terms shall lose 5 Points
      per reference to the Benevolent Speaker which does not use these
      terms. Other terms may be approved by future legislation. The
      Benevolent, Mighty Speaker is not bound by this Rule. 

It was then Amended to read: 

357.  Respect for the Speaker
      When a Voter refers to the Nomic Speaker, or any other Speaker,
      that Voter must use one of the following adjectives in conjunction
      with the Speaker:

      Admirable, Amazing, August, Atonishing, Astounding, Beloved,
      Benevolent, Brilliant, Celebrated, Circumcised, Circumspect,
      Cogetive, Competant, Consummate, Courteous, Deserving, Devoted,
      Diligent, Distinguished, Divine, Effulgent, Elevated, Eminent,
      Excellent, Exceptional, Extraordinary, Exalted, Fabulous, Famed,
      Fine, Foremost, Generous, Glorious, Gracious, Grand, Great,
      Hallowed, High, Holy, Honored, Illustrious, Impartial, Impressive,
      Incredible, Industrious, Influential, Judicious, Just, Kind,
      Kosher, Kindred, Lofty, Magnificent, Majestic, Magnanimous,
      Marvelous, Mighty, Neat, Noble, Omnilaborant, Outstanding,
      Overworked, Persuasive, Pensive, Phenominal, Pious, Prime,
      Qualified, Quintessential, Regal, Reknown, Remarkable, Respected,
      Revered, Solicitous, Spectacular, Splendid, Superb, Superior,
      Transcendant, Trustful, Unparalleled, Upright, Unusual, Venerated,
      Vigilant, Virile, Virtuous, Watchful, Wonderful, Worshipped,
      Xenophilic, Zelous, or any combination of the preceeding. 

      Any Voter not following this directive shall lose 1 Point per
      reference to the Great and Virtuous Speaker which does not use one
      of the above words. 

The Rule you are referring to was intended to allow Players to provide
Proof of another's wrong-doing in reference to this Rule without being
Guilty of breaking the Rule eirself. <grin>  Currently, it would also
apply to the incorrect use of Patent Titles. 

And a bit of trivia, the next Rule assessed a penalty to anyone
submitting a Proposal with a word which beginned with "Y" because we
couldn't think of a Y-word to describe the Regal, Omnilaborous Speaker
and we were feeling snippy. <grin> Of course, it even said it would
Repeal itself if the Rule quoted above was Amended to include a
Y-Word... <grin>  

We do miss the good 'ole days when the object was to have fun, be a bit
silly, and pass interesting Rules, rather than concentrating on being
democratic and fair to all and trying to form the perfect society.
Remember, folks, Nomic is just a Game. 



For the most part, the rest of your commentary is fairly interesting,
and hopefully many of your Protos will make it to the Proposal stage.
Lots of little nitpicks that need to be done eventually. And lots of
Points to be gained by doing them.... <wink> 


Enjoy!

Does anyone remember my Game Stae Modification proto?  The term GSM was
simply awful, but I see a lot of the same ideas popping up... I'll have
to dig that out again sometime.  Essentially, I distinguish three basic
types of GSM: Automatic, Proposed, and Manual.  Automatic GSMs occur
exclusively because of something specified in the Ruleset--usually based
on timing of some sort.  For instance, payment of Salaries would be an
AGSM, as would the end of the Voting Period.  Proposed GSMs would occur
as a direct result of Proposals; i.e. Rule Changes and Directives.
Manual GSMs would occur as a direct result of Player action (in the more
recent terminology, I would say that an MGSM is an Event which is caused
by a Move.)

I disagree.  A Group Vote is an Automatic Event which occurs as a result
of certain Manual Events...

This is somewhat contrary to the prevailing theory...  as I recall, the
recent consensus was that the Player was the Agoran Entity, and the
person the RL entity, and the Rules described a direct mapping of one to
the other.  This is why a Player can remain contiguous through
dereregistration cycles.

Ooh, neat: this was right at the top of one of my files.  Here I thought
I'd have to hunt for it.

(A prefatory note: substitute "event" for "GSM"--I think that works ok.
Also, I haven't even looked at these in months...)

Okay, some modifications have been made.  I tightened up GSMs a bit,
and played around with Inertia, setting up defaults and precedences so
the system would work just like it did now.

In another Proposal once this one passed, I would be able to start
defining Inertiae for the other AGSMs currently in the Ruleset, and
fixing things up a bit.

*Ultimately* my goal is to eliminate the distinction between Rule
Changes and other Game State Modifications.  See, if you think about it,
once I have my definitions in place, an Inertia can be defined for any
AGSM or PGSM, and then a Proposal can contain any number of PGSMs, which
change the Rules, or the Scores, or whatever.  Likewise, within the
Ruleset, there can be AGSMs defined which modify EVs or Bits as well as
other Rules.  So, this Proto is "Step 1" in this little project.  Of
course, if only this step in place, everything should *work* exactly the
same.  A little messy, though, since the terminology would be in a
transitional state between "GSM" language and "Proposal/Directive"
language.  (PS: For those of you interested in Steve's non-Proposed
Directives, that's what AGSMs are for. :)

Proto
Proposal/Index Consolidation and Reform

Repeal Rules 594, 993, 955, 1322, and 376.

Create the following Rule, entitled "Game State Modifications":
      Every modification of the State of Agora Nomic, in any way, is a 
      Game State Modification (GSM).  GSMs each fall into exactly one
      of the following categories:
      * Automated GSMs.  Automated GSMs are GSMs which take place without 
        being performed by a person.  They are specified in the Ruleset to 
        occur when certain conditions become true.  AGSMs may only take effect 
        if they are mandated by a Rule with MI greater than or equal to the 
        Inertia of the AGSM.
      * Proposed GSMs.  Proposed GSMs are GSMs which take place upon the 
        adoption of a Proposal.  They can be referred to as GSMs during the 
        Voting Period of the Proposal in which they are contained, but cannot 
        take effect until that Proposal passes, if ever.
      * Manual GSMs.  A Manual GSM is an action by a person (not necessarily 
        a Player) which somehow changes the State of Agora Nomic.  Note that a 
        Manual GSM is almost always the "trigger" for an Automated or Proposed 
        GSM to take effect.

{Comment:
Although not strictly necessary, this poses a convenient way to 
specify certain things elsewhere in this legislation, and can be used 
by all sorts of other types of legislation.  Once this is in place, 
and my redefinition of Power (vs. Inertia), we can eliminate the
distinction between Proposed Rule Change and Directive, both being PGSMs.}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Proposal-Related Indices":
      There is a Voting Index (VI) associated with every Proposal, which 
      represents the support received for that Proposal.  If the Proposal 
      received zero AGAINST Votes, and one or more FOR Votes, its VI is 
      Unanimity.  If the Proposal received zero FOR Votes, its VI is zero.  
      In all other cases, the VI is equal to the number of FOR Votes divided 
      by the number of AGAINST Votes.

      There is an Adoption Index (AI) associated with every Proposal, which 
      represents how much support that Proposal needs to pass.  The AI is 
      calculated once the Inertia of every PGSM contained within the Proposal 
      is known.  The AI is equal to the greatest Inertia Index of all PGSMs 
      within the Proposal.

      There is a Inertia Index (II) associated with every Proposed GSM and 
      every Automated GSM, which represents how much support is required for 
      that GSM to take effect.  The II of a PGSM or AGSM must be at least 1
      unless a Rule specifically says otherwise.  If the Rules are silent
      about the II of a certain GSM, the II for that GSM shall be 1.

      There is a Mutability Index (MI) associated with every Rule, which 
      represents how difficult it will be to change that Rule.  The MI of a 
      newly Created Rule is 1, but may be modified thereafter.

{Comment:
This stuff should be centralized and well-defined.  That's mostly what 
I'm doing here, plus I'm changing Power a bit.  Now, instead of saying 
each GSM has a Power derived from AI or MI, and does or doesn't take 
effect based on that, I say that each GSM has an Inertia based on what 
it's trying to do, from which the AI is derived.  I'm pretty sure this 
removes the circularity.}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Inertiae: A Stopgap"
      The Inertia Index of a Rule Change is the greater of the current MI of
      the affected Rule (if any) and what the MI of the Rule would be if the
      Rule Change takes effect (if any).

      The Inertia Index of any AGSM, except Non-Proposed Rule Changes, is 1.

{Comment:
This is a stopgap, because I don't feel like tackling the MI=3 Rule 105
just yet, at least not as part of this multipart proto--maybe later, once
GSMs have proven their worth.  As for the AGSMs, well, that's really the
way it is now.}

Rules 1052, 1054, and 1416 shall be Amended by replacing occurrences of
      "The Proposal containing such a Directive must have an Adoption
      Index of at least 2."
with
      "Directives of this type have an Inertia Index of 2."

Rules 649, 1044, and 1070 shall be Amended by replacing all sentences
which contain the phrase "Adoption Index" with the following sentence:
      "Directives of this type have an Inertia Index of 1."

Rule 1453 shall be Amended by replacing occurrences of "Adoption Index"
with "Inertia Index".

{Comment:
This fixes up all the Directive types with Inertias. (Inertiae?)}

Create the following Rule, entitled "Proposals":
      Directives and Rule Changes which are contained in Proposals are 
      collectively referred to as Proposed Game State Modifications (PGSMs).  
      A Proposal contains one or more PGSMs.

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which have 
      been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor, and the Voting 
      Index calculated.  If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption 
      Index for a given Proposal, then that Proposal shall pass.  If the 
      Voting Index exactly equals the Adoption Index, then the Assessor 
      shall choose whether the Proposal passes or fails.  If the Voting 
      Index is less than the Adoption Index, the Proposal shall fail.

      A Proposal which passes takes effect at the date and time stamped on
      the first message sent by the Assessor to reach the Public Forum 
      announcing the results of the Voting on that Proposal.

      If a single message sent by the Assessor contains the Voting results 
      on several Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at the same 
      time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.  When a Proposal 
      takes effect, the PGSMs contained therein take effect in the order in 
      which they appear in the Proposal.

{Comment:
This is, essentially, the material currently in 376, 594, 993, and 
955, minus the stuff about calculating AI and VI.}



Proto
Implement GSM language in 108

Rule 108 shall be Amended as follows, and given the title "When May 
GSMs Take Effect?":

      No Automated GSM may take effect earlier than the adoption of the

So you are defining a Move solely as an action undertaken by a person?
Thus any result of that Move would be an Event. May we suggest a
modification? 

If we define a Move as any action undertaken by a Game Entity, that
would prevent a considerable but of trouble with regards to Groups.
Wouldn't it be MUCH easier to retract the Events resulting from a
Group's action than to try and negate the existance of a Group's action?
Also, it would be quite simple to define a person's Registration as a 
Player as an Event triggered by an action which is not necessarily a
Move.

However, that's still gonna leave a big mess. *Lots* of Marks transfers
are private...and if they've been sent to the wrong person they don't
happen. So we may still have to ratify the current Marks 'accounts'
by Proposal.

actually, the US can still pay its debts (for a little while) by
tapping some cash-heavy trust funds.  all that lapsed today was the
authority to spend money.  tomorrow the authority to borrow money
lapses, which will force the Treasury to tap things like these trust
funds to continue to make payments on the national debt.  they can
probably do so for quite a while, although eventually payment would
have to be made in gold (once the aforementioned cash runs out).

i would sincerely hope that the twits in congress have enough sense to
not force a national default.  it bothered me that congress did _not_
burn the midnight oil last night trying to reach a compromise; at 11PM
EST C-Span was showing four republicans "debating" before an empty
chamber about what a twit the president is.  i've seen the indiana
legislature stay in continuous session for weeks at a time (it's funny
to see legislators sleeping in the chambers) trying to reach budgetary
compromises; why can't Congress do the same thing?  then again, the
congresscritters are currently not being paid; their salaries are part
of the "nonessential" portion of the budget (so is the president's).

Yes, because there is no authority by which Saltwater can become
Banker again. (Only Office can be transfered, but Banker is not an Office,
making it fall under Rule 1011, I presume.

I read about these trust funds. One funny thing (funny, well, to
non-Americans) is that that money has to be paid back later, with
interest accrued.

Payment made in gold? I am not sure about that. More likely the
gold will be sold first to make the payments in dollars, as the
dollar is no longer on the gold-standard.

I heard that this is not the first time the gouvernment "shuts down",
but the first time with a democratic President.

It's a poker game, isn't it?
Seen from here the Republicans stand more to loose, as they are
(publicly at least) more devoted to a deficit reduction.
actually increase the deficit in the coming years.
On the other hand, nobody seem to think that it will actually come
so far: hence nobody will try to do something about it.

The way *I* do it:

I have in my .exrc file the following line:

map = 6dd:!fort.perl:r ~/.sig


What this does: first, it deletes the six lines starting with the line
the cursor is on.  Then it runs the program called "fort.perl".  Then it
reads in the file "~/.sig".  See, I have a program called "fort.perl",
which I wrote, which runs the "fortune" program until it gets a fortune
of three lines or less.  Then, it prints to the file ~/.sig a blank
line, followed by the top line of my sig (the -=-=-=- one), another
blank line, and the three-line fortune.  I have my mailer set up so that
it always prints a "--" at the end of each message, followed by the
contents of the file ~/.sig, which is always six lines long.  Then, to
sign a message, I use the appropriate name depending on the destination
(Vanyel, Don, etc.), then go to the blank line immediately below and hit
the equal sign and press enter.  This gives me a new random sig.  If it
is inappropriate, I repeat until I get something appropriate.

Complicated, I know... but neat!

When we decided to do it, we couldn't figure out who it was that was
sleeping on the job, so we settled for Coco out of convenience, figuring
that e probably wouldn't miss it. However, since you were so kind as to
point out our error, we'll make our second transfer of the week:

Official Kudo Transfer: 
-----
We transfer one Kudos...

FROM ourself, for not keeping track of people as well as we should have

TO a random Player. 
-----

This transfer should also have the side effect of testing the validity
of Rule 494 and a few other things we are wondering about. We therefore
officially Call for Judgement on the following Statement: 

Official CFJ: 
-----
Statement: Rule 494 shall be interpreted such that if any Move refers to 
a random choice, the Speaker thall make that random choice. 

Relevant Rules: 494  

Barred Players: We would like to Bar whoever is the current Speaker from
Judgement, due to the fact that this may effect eir duties, and because
we want to Bar someone... <grin> 
-----



Enjoy!

Um, but wasn't that *one specific* Rule which said for a certain
type of message, the date of the message was the Date:, so long
as it was to the knowledge of the sender dated accurately within
5 minutes?  And since that applied only to the specific sort of
message which that Rule dealt with, it would *not* apply to all messages
in general?

Could you dig up that CFJ and post it?  I'd be interested in seeing it.

Let's see...there are Theses, which are admittedly rather
limited. Just brainstorming:

Action to be rewarded:
Getting more Players
Improving cultural life of Agora
Acquiring RL resources (computer space, programs, et. al.)
Clever ideas for Contests
Finding loopholes in Rules
Creating paradox
Gaining recognition from outside sources

Possible Rewards:
Freedom from obeying certain, limited Rules 
Preferential Judgeship
Ability to mint own currency
Ownership of Virtual Real-estate
Ability to expedite certain Proposals or CFJ's

(note most of the above I would term "unfair" unless
limited in duration)

Only that you appear not to know how to spell "Warranty".

I am willing, and kindly request any documents pertaining to that 
Office to be sent to me. Failing that, I will assume that there are 
indeed no active FPDs and post a Report to that effect shortly. :)

I also reiterate my willingness to be Promotor, since the question 
has been asked and answered by so many different people in recent 
times that I can't even remember if I ever stated that in the PF. :)

Oops, sent the wrong file!  *blush*

Here's the second installment... somewhat shorter although it covers
more Rules.  No CFJs, but there are 9 Protoes here.  For anyone keeping
count: I'm halfway through page 5... this covers three pages of my
ten-page printout...

*** CONTINUED FROM PART 1 ***

Rule 1339, "Rule Changes".  I'm against Repeal of this one; it
distinguishes types of Rule Change.


Rule 594, "Proposals and Rule Changes".  I'm against repeal.
Rulekeepor: 594/0 was enacted by Proposal 594 on 21 Oct 94.

Rule 993, "Directives".  I'm against repeal.
-----
Proto Green-27
Let the first lines make sense

Whereas "one or more" is a misleading method of stating permission,

Be it therefore resolved that Rules 594 and 993 be Amended by
replacing the words "one or more" with "zero or more".

Be it further resolved that Rule 993 be Amended by replacing the words
"be placed in a Proposal" in the first paragraph with "take effect".
-----
Rulekeepor: This rule was probably originally created by Proposal 807,
and later amended by Proposal 891 and finally by 993 (which was
distributed 11 Aug 94).


Rule 404, "Legality of Proposals".  I am indifferent to the fate of
this Rule, as it is redundant with Rule 116.  Rulekeepor: This rule
was enacted on 3 Sep 93 (our oldest non-original non-amended rule, I
think).


Rule 1036, "Making and Distributing Proposals".  I am against the
Repeal of this Rule, but perhaps it should be reTitled?  After all, it
is the rule which defines the Office of Promotor...  Rulekeepor: This
rule derives from the original Rule 204, which was amended by Proposal
415 on 3 Sep 93, and 1036 on 21 Sep 94.


Rule 1061, "Bonus to New Players".  I suppose this Rule serves a
purpose, but administratively speaking it's kind of annoying.  So I'm
FOR it's Repeal.  Rulekeepor: Proposal 1061 enacted this rule on 20Sep
94.


Rule 109, "Proposal Numbers".  I'm against the repeal of this Rule,
although I wouldn't oppose modifications to it similar to what has
been recently discussed... (I especially liked the idea of keeping the
Promotor, but for every Protoed Rule, a Proposal number would be
assigned.)


Rule 1349, "Rule Numbering".  I'm against the repeal of this Rule.
-----
Proto Green-28
Lose the bootstraps already

Be it resolved that Rule 1349 be Amended by deleting the text ", or
301, whichever is greater".
-----


Rule 659, "Rewards/Penalties Based on Length/Form of Proposal".  Is it
just me, or is this Rule a real pain?
-----
Proto Green-29
What a pain, lose the width-length penalty

Whereas Rule 659 only serves to annoy people who try to make omnibus
reform,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 659 be Repealed.
-----
Rulekeepor: Originally created by proposal 394 on 23 Aug 93, this rule
was later amended by Proposal 659 on 29 Oct 93.


Rule 748, "Blank/Required Lines Don't Count".  Is this really
necessary?  I'm indifferent to its Repeal.  Rulekeepor: This rule was
enacted on 1 Dec 93.


Rule 783, "Illegality of Bonus Clauses".  I'm against the Repeal of
this Rule, as for some reason group psychology is such that these
things actually _pass_.  Rulekeepor: Rule 326 was enacted on 19 Jul
93, and later amended by Proposal 783 sometime in January of 94.

Rule 1003, "No Coercive Proposals".  I'm against the Repeal of this
Rule, too, since people actually vote for these things half the time.
Should Rules 783 and 1003 be combined?  Obviously their content is
very similar; I'm not sure if it is different enough to warrant two
Rules.  Rulekeepor: This rule was probably created by Proposal 822,
between 14 and 22 Feb 94.  It was later amended by 1003 (which wwas
distributed 18 Aug 94).


Rule 1065, "Discourages Too Many Proposals".  I'm for the Repeal of
this Rule... it just gets in people's way.  Why would we want to
discourage too many Proposals?  Rulekeepor: Rule 843 was enacted on 3
Mar 94, amended by 936 (dist. 3 Jul 94), and then 1065 (dist. 4 Oct
94).



Category: Voting on Proposals


Rule 1449, "The Assessor".  Short and to the point, I'm against repeal
of this Rule.


Rule 106, "Adopting Proposals".  Against repeal.


Rule 693, "Prescribed Voting Period".  Against repeal.


Rule 1451, "Disowning Proposals".  I can't imagine why I ever liked
this idea... it's really annoying, though.  Especially in light of the
fact that Powers and EVs may or may not remain cast on a disowned
Proposal.  I'm FOR its Repeal.


Rule 206, "Voting Entities and Votes".  Against repeal.


Rule 452, "No Electioneering by Assessor".  Against repeal.
Rulekeepor: Rule 452/0 was enacted on 10 Sep 93.


Rule 683, "Legal Votes".  Against repeal.  Rulekeepor: Original Rule
207 was amended into Rule 683/0 on 10 nov 93.


Rule 957, "YES=FOR, NO=AGAINST, Anything else=ABSTAIN".  This is
redundant with 754, so I'm FOR its repeal.  Rulekeepor: 462 was
created 17 Sep 93, amended by 957 on 25 Jul 94.


Rule 312, "A Point for Voting".  Against repeal, at least until
Parties get into the picture (what's up with them?)  Rulekeepor: 312/0
was enacted 15 Jul 93.



Category: The End of the Voting Period


Rule 879, "Quorum".  Hm, is this necessary?  I'm indifferent here.
Rulekeepor: Proposal 879 Amended 201 on 13 Apr 94.


Rules 208, 955, 1322, 108, 376, and 1069 are too vital to be mucking
around with.  Against repeal.  Rulekeepor: 209 -> 396 (23 Aug 93) ->
658 (29 Oct 93) -> 761 (8 Dec 93) -> 955 (25 Jul 94);  210 -> 376 (16
Aug 93);  750 (1 Dec 93) -> 1069 (4 Oct 94).


Rule 1443, "Bonus for Proto-Proposing".  While not strictly necessary,
this is nice--it tends to cut down on making not-well-thought-out
Proposals.  Plus, if we ever tie Proposal Numbering to Proto-proposing
(even a little bit) this would be very easy to track.  Against repeal.


Rule 833, "Reward or Penalty for Proposing".  F-A is getting boring...
how about something new?
-----
Proto Green-30
New Reward/Penalty system

Whereas the F-A reward is getting boring,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 833 be Amended to read as follows:

      At the end of the Voting Period, the Proposal Reward for a given
      Proposal is calculated to be the greatest integer less than or
      equal to the number of FOR votes cast, squared, minus the number
      of AGAINST votes cast, squared, all over 10.  In mathematical
      notation, that is

                              |   2    2  |
                              |  F  - A   |
                              | --------- |
                              |_   10    _|

      If the Proposal Reward is positive, then the Proposor of that
      Proposal gains a number of Points equal to the Proposal Reward; if
      the Proposal Reward is negative, then the Proposor loses a number
      of Points equal to the absolute value of the Proposal Reward.
-----
Should be interesting, at least. Rulekeepor: Proposal 833 Amended Rule
544 on 1 Mar.  I haven't the faintest idea what Proposal 544 did.


Rule 1519, "Bonus for Short Proposals".  Again, this isn't
particularly necessary--I would much rather have short Rules than
short Proposals.  I'm FOR this repeal.


Rule 947, "Bonus for Repeal".  Why do we need this?  Especially after
the Green Repeals, the Ruleset should be about as pruned as necessary
for a while.  For repeal.  Rulekeepor: This rule was enacted by
Proposal 947, which was distributed 3 Jul 94.



Category: Referenda and Elections


Rule 1434, "Default Procedure for Referendum Voting".  Against repeal;
I think we can and should use this for Officer elections, at least.


Rule 1445, "Defaults for Elections".  Likewise, I'm against repeal.



Category: The Clerk of the Courts


Rule 889, "Clerk of the Courts", and 1450, "Speaker Cannot Stay CotC
or Justiciar", are important and shouldn't be repealed.  Rulekeepor:
This rule was enacted by Prop 406 on 3 Sep 94, and amended by Prop 889
on 13 Apr 94.


Rule 1484, "Separation of Powers".  This rule is unnecessary, I
think... I'm for repeal of it.



Category: Calling for Judgement
Obviously, we want to be _verrrry_ careful with these.  I'm against
repeal on all of these, but I have protoes for some... Kelly, let me
know if I'm stepping on your toes here, or whether you've given up on
Judicial reform.


Rule 991, "Invoking Judgement".
-----
Proto Green-31
Get rid of that "disagreement" junk

Whereas the first paragraph of Rule 991 is superfluous, and

Whereas we do not wish to have unnecessary uses of ambiguous "may"
language,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 991 be Amended by replacing the
first two sentences with the following text:

      A Call for Judgement is made when, if, and only if a Player sends
      a Statement for Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts.

and by removing the text "(*Was 407*)" and "This Rule defers to all
other Rules which do not contain this sentence."
-----

Rules 662 and 897 are ok (well, kind of--I'll let Kelly handle most of
that)

Rulekeepor: 213 -> 407 (3 Sep 93) -> 991 (dist. 5 Aug 94);  ?585? ->
662 (2 Nov 93);  897 (Apr 94).



Category: Selecting a Judge
All the Rules in this Category (951, 1005, 698) are fine.  Rulekeepor:
I do believe 951 is our Most Amended rule; it has 14 Amendments to it.
214 -> 364 (8 Aug 93) -> 410 (26 Aug 93) ?->? 586 (?) -> 647 (29 Oct
93) -> 793 (dist. 24 Jan 94) -> 890 (13 Apr 94) -> 951 (25 Jul 94).
Also 503 (30 Sep 93) -> 1005 (dist. 18 Aug 94); 482 (30 Sep 93) ->
6948 (12 Nov 93).



Category: Delivering Judgement
All the Rules in this Category (48, 591, 217, 451, 502, 663, 665, 289,
1500, 1365) are ok and I'm afraid to mess with them. :)
Rulekeepor stuff: 215 -> 408 (3 Sep 93);  216 -> 409 (26 Aug 93) ->
591 (21 Oct 93);  451 (10 Sep 93);  430 (dist 6 Sep 93) -> 502 (30 Sep
93);  663 (2 Nov 93);  665 (2 Nov 93);  789 (dist. 7 Jan 94).


Category: Overturning Judgement
All the Rules in this Category (911--do you realize how appropriately
this rule is numbered?!--, 910, 1448, 1447) are ok and needn't be
messed with at this time.  Rulekeepor's mess: 384 (dist. 16 Aug 93) ->
690 (11 Nov 93) -> 911 (4 May 94); 910 (4 May 94).



Category: Rule Violations


Rule 908, "Formal Apologies".  This Rule is far too cute and amusing
(punishment by creativity, indeed) to repeal. :)  Rulekeepor: Proposal
781 was distribute 13 Dec 93, and enacted, and later amended by 908 on
4 May 94.



Category: Crimes and Infractions
The Rules in this Category, while not inviolable, are sturdy and seem
to hold up nicely.  As I like the pragmatic content, I am against
repeal.



Category: The Distributor and the Assistant


Rule 796, "The Distributor".  Against Repeal.
-----
Proto Green-33
Modernize the Distributor

Whereas official business now occurs over the Public Forum,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 796 be Amended to read as follows:

      There is an Office called the Office of Distributor.  The
      Distributor is in charge of the Public Forum, and the distribution
      of Official documents to all Players.  The Salary of the
      Distributor is 2 Points.
-----
Rulekeepor: The Distributor came into being as Rule 510 on 5 Oct 93,
and was later amended by 796 (dist. 24 Jan 94).


Rule 514, "Keep the Distributor Informed of Your Address".  I am FOR the
Repeal of this Rule, as the Registrar already keeps this information.
(Furthermore, the restriction is trivially fulfilled by the Player's
address appearing in a Registrar's Report.)  Rulekeepor: Enacted in
current form 5 Oct 93.


Rule 512, "Distributor Tries Three Times Then Quits".  Against repeal.
-----
Proto Green-34
Clarify 512

Be it resolved that Rule 512 be Amended by replacing "the Distributor"
in the first sentence with "official mail", and by inserting "by the
Distributor" between "shall be made" and "to contact".
-----
Rulekeepor: Enacted in current form 5 Oct 93.


Rule 513, "Distributor Golds On to Messages".  Against repeal.
-----
Proto Green-35
Distributor isn't forwarding anymore

Whereas the Distributor no longer directly forwards official mail to
Players,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 513 be Amended by replacing "he
forwards to all Players" with "are sent to the Public Forum".
-----
Rulekeepor: Enacted in current form 5 Oct 93.


Rule 839, "Office of the Assistant".  My Proposal 1791 already covers
this.  Rulekeepor: The Assistant was created by Prop 839 on 1 Mar 94.

Opposed. There is a long tradition of misspellangs in Agora.

However, I will probably support this, if and only if Swann Proposes it.

No, I'm sorry, I'm sure you're wrong.  "Marken" just _sounds_ funny.
And what are you trying to say in that sentence?  "He pays the ten Marks
with ten Marks"?  I don't understand what semantic point you are trying
to make here... but in any case, I'm sure that "Marken" is _not_ the
plural.  "Mark" is.  "Er bezahlte mir zehn Mark."

OK, I'll jump in some!  Here's how I picture the Platonization
Project going:

  - Define some infrastructure to take the place of current
    Rule Violations:
    - Define four new Classes of Crime (probably 1, 2, 3, and 4?),
      to correspond to violating MI=N Rules; penalties are N Blots
      for each.
    - Update 908 (Formal Apologies), expanding it to cover Crimes
      as well as Rule Violations,
    - Update 662 to allow for a CFJ to the effect that a Player
      has committed a specific Crime (if necessary),
    - No doubt some other stuff.

  - Systematically find those Rules that admit of being broken,
    and change (for instance) "No Player shall X" to "A Player
    who Xs commits a Class 1 Crime".

  - Fix up the Compact Rules along the same lines: require that
    Compacts be Platonic, and allow them to specify that certain
    actions by Players under their Jurisdiction are Crimes of a
    certain Class.

  - Get rid of some Rules that are no longer needed at all,
    such as 1439 (unless a Criminalized version is needed),
    and the Rule-violation wording in 908.

  - Fix 101 to require explicitly say that the Rules are Platonic,
    and perhaps that non-Platonist Rules have no legal force.

Sounds like good fun!   *8)

PROTO: Fix the @#!$%&* Speaker/Voter distinction

Amend Rule 103 to read as follows:

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Citizen or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Citizen and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Citizens and the
      Speaker.

The Title of Rule 103 shall be Changed from "The Speaker and Voters" to
"The Speaker and the Citizens."

The following Rules are hereby amended by replacing each instance of the
word "Voter" with the word "Citizen" and by replacing each instance of
the word "Voters" with the word "Citizens":

    Rule 1043, Rule 1042, Rule  112, Rule  724, Rule 1433,Rule 785
    Rule  942, Rule  786, Rule  402, Rule 1427

Amend Rule 1498 by replacing the word "Player" with the word "Citizen"
and by deleting:

     , providing that Player has not also Won the previous Game in
     this manner

Amend Rule 1492 by replacing the first instance of the word "Player"
with the word "Citizen."



{Comment: I had to do this, since at least two othjer Players insisted it was
          too hienous an effort to eliminate this paticular Agoran
          archaism.  While this is AI=3 because of some of the high 
          precidence Rules involved, I would find controversy over this rather
          hard to understand.  The only changes in meaning here are in the
          new "Win" rules, where I reassert the original nomic idea that
          only someone other than the current Speaker should Win the Game--
          I can, however, drop the final two amendments if there are
          objections.  All else is simply changing a single confusing and
          now-erronious word.}

Hm.  Well, I looked it up, and the entry is:
Mark [mark] 1. f (-/-) coin: mark....

So I'd suspect that the plural is just "Mark" in any case.  Now I see
what you're saying, and I'm not sure how to say it, although for clarity
I'd throw in "Muenzen" (coins).

Please do, I can't come up with a way to say that that sounds right.
I think that your sentence would just read "Er bezahlte die zehn Mark
mit zehn Mark".  Also--mit "Pfennig", you havea similar situation... I
would say "drei Pfennig" for a three-pfennig value, while I would say
"drei Pfennige" for three physical ein-pfennig coins.  And sure enough,
the listing for "Pfennig" indicates -e to be the plural form...

There are a few Proposals in the Archives for which votes are listed as
"x2".  I assume this ties in to group voting, somehow... but I'm not
entirely clear on how.  Could someone enlighten me?  Here is an example,
Proposal 724:

PROPOSAL 724 (Dave Wagner)

Requirements for Winning
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 584 to read as follows:

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many Points.
      The minimum number of Points required for Player X to win is
      10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently registered in
      the Game, and G is the number of Games which Player X has already won.
      If more than one Voter achieves this condition simultaneously, then
      all such Voters win.
      When a Game ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new Speaker
          and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is tied for
          the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects one of them
          to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the status
          they had at the end of the old Game.

Subject: Thoughts on Game Custom
Sender: owner-nomic-discussion@teleport.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: nomic-discussion@teleport.com
Status: RO

This article explores the many meta-rules and understandings involved 
in Agora Nomic, sometimes referred to as "Game Custom". These are custom
of behavior or of perception that the players all try to follow.  In 
situations where not all players are following the same custom, the
Nomic dispute-resolution procedures are required.

Some of these are not just Game Custom but are actually part of the Rules.
Obviously I'm not including the entire Ruleset, but I will point out
some Rule-based customs that seem important.

Obviously these are just my own understanding.  However, I have hopes 
that this reflects actual Game Custom in most cases, even where I
prefer it were otherwise.  Where I have specific enough preferences,
I've indicated it in "recommendations".

----------------------------------
Construction of Rules.  Rules are construed according to their
meaning and not according to their intent.  They govern all aspects
of the game collectively and not in isolation.  Words explicitly
defined in the Rules have the defined meaning; words not so defined
are usually interpreted according to their ordinary meaning.

RECOMMENDATION:  Settle by Rule or CFJ the status of words making up
"phrases of art", e.g. not explicitly defined but obviously used in a 
special manner in the Ruleset.

----------------------------------
Creation of Entities.  Agora consists of the Rules and other entities
coming under the purview of the Rules.  Any such entity either exists 
independently of the Rules, or is created by the Rules and of a "type"
created by the Rules.  Types are distinct.  Created entities only exist 
if created in accordance with the Rules.

----------------------------------
Destruction of Entities.  An entity created in accordance with the Rules 
ceases to exist when there is (for a period of time) no Rule referring to 
that Type of entity.

----------------------------------
Modification of Entities. An entity created under the Rules has continuing
existence until destroyed, either explicitly or by virtue of the Destruction
metarule.  In particular, if the Rules referring to that Type of entity are
modified, then the entity is itself modified to conform to the new Rules.

Attributes, designations, and states under the Rules also have this kind of
continuity, continuing in effect until changed in accordance with the Rules.

RECOMMENDATION:  Settle by Rule or CFJ what happens when the Rules are so 
modified that some features of the entity or attribute cannot be determined 
from the new Rules.

----------------------------------
Game state.  This is the status of all Rules and all entities coming under 
the purview of the Rules.

----------------------------------
Game move.  This is an action of some sort taking place under the Rules
and at least potentially having some effect on the Game state in accordance
with the Rules.

----------------------------------
Time limits.  If the Rules require a Player to perform some action (or Game 
move), but do not specify a time limit, then the player cannot be charged
with a violation of the Rule by neglecting the action.

RECOMMENDATION:  Allow a CFJ that such a move has been delayed unreasonably.
Then if the move is an automatic one, the Judge could declare that it was 
already made.  If it was a pragmatic one, then the Judge could appoint a 
Receiver to make it in the Player's place.

----------------------------------
Names.  A player may be referred to by any unambiguous name by which they 
are generally known.  If a player announces to all players that they wish 
to use another nickname, and this is unambiguous, then the player may be
referred to by that name.  The same string may in fact be two different
names if it is used in different contexts. (e.g. The Nomic Potato)

----------------------------------
Registration.  A player is a person registered to play.  A person may only
be one Player.  If a player leaves the Game and returns, they are still 
the same Player.

A corporate person could nominate a person to represent them as 
a Player in the Game, provided that person was not otherwise registered 
as a Player.  The terms of this representation would be enforced by extra-
Game agreement.

RECOMMENDATION:  Settle by Rule or CFJ the status of corporate Players 
within the game.

----------------------------------
Voting.  Certain game moves require "voting" by the Players.  A vote is 
customarily a game move that occurs when the vote is sent, but it may
be changed during the voting period.  This change has the effect of 
cancelling the old vote and substituting for it the new vote at the 
new time.  Thus players leaving the Game may vote before doing so, 
(but not change their vote after leaving), and players new to the 
Game may vote immediately.

RECOMMENDATION:  Restrict voting to those who were Players at the beginning
of the Voting Period.

----------------------------------
Permitted versus possible.  Rule 116 says that things are permitted if not
forbidden.  It does not necessarily mean that they can be made to happen
by chanting "abracadabra" in the Public Forum or elsewhere.

----------------------------------
Rule to obey the rules.  Rule 101 says "obey the rules".  It does not 
follow that if it is repealed we may break the Rules.

----------------------------------
Conditional actions.  Customarily, conditional moves are allowed, such as
"If xxx then I transfer NN points to Player yyy.  Otherwise, I don't"
and take full effect.  The effect of more obscure and involved conditionals
is not settled game custom.

----------------------------------
Time-delayed actions.  Customarily, time-delayed moves are allowed, such as
"I transfer NN points to player yyy, effective on dd-mmm-yy at hh:mm" and 
take full effect as of the time named.  Such moves can be extra work for 
the Officers, however, and are usually used only when the exact timing of 
an event is important, such as in a Scam.

----------------------------------
Retroactive actions.  Customarily it is not possible for any game move 
to change the game state as of a previous point in time.  CFJ's do not 
change a prior game state, though they may discover new facts about it 
that were not apparent before.

----------------------------------
Timing of obligations.  If a player is obligated to perform some game move
or action upon certain conditions, the obligation begins as soon as the 
conditions take effect, and is discharged when the required move is made.
Additional obligations to perform the same game move do not require additional
instances of the move, though some obligations are additive in nature and
are not regarded as the "same" game move.

The case of obligations that recur weekly is unsettled.

RECOMMENDATION:  If a player is obliged to perform an obligation weekly, 
the obligation begins at the beginning of the week.  In particular a new 
Rule creating such an obligation does not oblige a player during the 
remainder of the week in which the new Rule takes effect.

FURTHER RECOMMENDATION:  If a player is obliged to perform an obligation 
weekly or during some other time limit, and the Rule is repealed or amended 
so as to no longer so obligate the player, then the obligation is cancelled.
However, if the obligation or the time limit is modified before it is 
discharged, then the player is still obligated under the modified form of 
the Rule within the time limit.

----------------------------------
Official Duties.  If a Player is obligated to perform certain actions, as 
a result of a designation or of holding a position under the Rules, then 
if another Player is so designated or holds the position in the player's
stead, the obligation is transferred to the new Player.  If a player 
ceases to hold the designation or position for any reason, and no other
player takes their place, then nobody is responsible for fulfilling the
obligation.

----------------------------------
Platonic versus Pragmatic.  Game moves that are purely retractible, 
(such as a Point transfer) are simply without effect if found to be
illegal.  Game moves that are at least partly non-retractible may incur
a sanction but otherwise have whatever effects they are bound to have.

----------------------------------
Secret rules.  Players cannot be subject to Rules or laws that are unknown
to them.  Similarly, entities which are non-disclosable to players who must
make judgements with respect to them, cannot have any effect on the Game state.

----------------------------------
Automatic actions by Officers.  Officers are simply recordkeepers.  Unless
otherwise explicitly worded, any event taking place under authority of an 
Office, involving pure game entities, is deemed to have taken place when 
the Rules empower it, without any separate action of the Officer.

----------------------------------
Definition of Proposal.  A Proposal is now anything so designated.

RECOMMENDATION:  Do this for CFJs.

----------------------------------
Incorrect reports.  If a player is required to publish a portion of the 
game state, errors in the report are not a violation of the Rules, but
are dealt with via Claims of Error.

----------------------------------
Randomness.  Some actions are purely unverifiable.  Like randomness, or
truth in advertising.

RECOMMENDATION:  keep these to a minimum.

----------------------------------
Disclosure and secrecy.  Certain items are designated as privileged and
may not be disclosed.  Certain items are so sensitive that knowledge of them
may not even be used (like people's vote) to the advantage of the person
so knowing.  (This is another almost-purely-unverifiable.)

----------------------------------
The "sending" of messages.  In an e-mail based game, Rules referring to
a message "sent" from a Player to a Player, refer to the moment it leaves
the control of the player with the normal expectation that it will reach
its intended destination.  This can be the case even if the message passes
through the hands of other persons, and even if it turns out to be impossible
for the message to actually reach its destination.

----------------------------------
Crises.  Certain times are referred to as "crises", when there is a
disagreement about the Game State.  These are resolved through the usual
conflict-resolution mechanism (CFJs).  More serious is the case where there
is a conflict involving the mechanism for resolving disagreements itself,
or in which the Ruleset as a whole appears broken.

RECOMMENDATION: Create a "Reconstituting" mechanism deeply entrenched in 
the Rules, such as:

  Proposal (MI=4)
  Nomic Firewall
      
  Create a rule that reads as follows:
      
      If a Player believes that the Rules are hopelessly broken, e may
      send in a Public Message a Proposition that the Rules be replaced,
      including a Proposed Replacement Ruleset.
      
      Such a Proposition is adopted if at least 10 Players, comprising at 
      least a majority of all players, approve or reject it in a Public 
      Message within 10 days of the posting of the Proposition, with no
      Speaker rejecting it, and with at least 4 times as many Players
      approving as rejecting during the entire 10-day period.  Otherwise 
      it is not adopted.
      
      If the Proposition is adopted:
      
        1. First, all Rules except this one are automatically repealed.
      
        2. Next, for each Proposed Rule in the Proposition, a Rule is 
           created with the indicated text, and numbered with the 
           indicated number.  If the Proposed Replacement Ruleset 
           grants other properties to Rules, (for example Mutable/
           Immutable status), then those properties are specified 
           for each Rule as indicated in the Proposition.  All these 
           creations and specifications happen simultaneously.
      
      For purposes of this Rule: 

        1. a Public Message is any message to all Players, or to any 
           list server or other mechanism most recently designated as 
           a Public Forum in accordance with the Rules.
      
        2. a Player is anyone listed as a Player in an official report 
           during the previous month, or who has subsequently become a 
           Player in accordance with the Rules.
      
        3. a "Speaker" is anyone listed as Speaker in an official report 
           during the previous month.
      
        4. an official report is a report sent to all Players, or to all 
           persons reasonably believed at the time to be players, and sent 
           under authority of the Rules, or reasonably believed by the 
           sender to be sent under authority of the Rules, during the 
           previous month.
      
      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules.

Why not at the same time do away with the m-word ? And why not also 
disinfect the Rule as long as you're doing that ?

Well, with 116 *also* up for Repeal, I would't be so sure that it's 
safe to Repeal 404...

Go ahead; it _has_ served its purpose (for me at least). I'm 
surprised that this Rule doesn't go up for Repeal 5 weeks after any 
New Player comes in ? Well, if 1061 isn't Greened, I will probably 
do that myself.

I'm not sure we should do that at the Proto stage; this would leave 
gaps in the numbering, and it would be confusing when resurrecting 
old Protos. Have you seen my Proposal Codes proto ?

Well... I think we should have something like it. But then again, 
maybe it's time to replace it with Style Points.

Wasn't this Rule created to avoid some specific Scams ? We should 
know about that before we Repeal it, so we can be sure it's safe.

OTOH, why ten days ? Is there a good reason for that ? I'd probably 
support a proposal to shorten it to a week...

I'm not; but I'd like that Rule to allow a Proposal to be deleted 
instead of just disowned.

What of a Proposal with no one Voting on it ? Does it pass or fail ?

Style Points ? :)

We'll keep track of them if you want us to; we just don't want to have
to look at them every time we look at the Rule Set. There's no reason
for them not to be a comment by the Rulekeepor, but there's also no
reason to keep them legislated into the Rule. 


Enjoy!

That isn't exactly what the cfj said, as I recall... I'll post the CFJ
at the end of this message.

Not exactly.  We of MAPLSIRUP were kind of annoyed.  But here are the
two requested CFJs (803, then 710):


============================================================

CFJ 803

Caller: Zefram

Statement: The second clause of the second sentence of rule 1488/0 is
without legal effect.

Judge: Michael

============================================================

History:
  Called by Zefram Mon, 7 Aug 1995 11:51:20 BST
  Assigned to Michael Tue, 08 Aug 1995 19:59:53 -0500
  Judged FALSE by Michael Tue, 15 Aug 1995 11:17:50 BST

Effects of this CFJ (Scorekeepor, take note!):
  Michael gains 3 Points for timely Judgement.

============================================================

Arguments of Caller (Zefram):

The first sentence of rule 1488/0 states "Let there be an Entity known
as the Nomic Potato".  Note that there was already, prior to the
creation of this rule, an Entity known as "the Nomic Potato"; it is a
Contest, created on 1995-08-02, and its Contestmaster is Zefram.  Much
of rule 1488/0 is concerned with who shall possess the Nomic Potato,
and this does not conflict with any other rule, as no other rule states
anything about the possession of a Contest.

The second sentence of rule 1488/0 states "There is only one Potato
which cannot be destroyed".  This obviously refers to the Nomic Potato,
already referred to in the first sentence.  Rule 1011/0 requires that
there is only one Nomic Potato, because if there were more than one
then they would have the same name, violating that rule.  Rule 1488/0
therefore, despite the lack of a clarifying comma in that sentence,
states that the one Nomic Potato cannot be destroyed.

Rule 1446/3 states that a Contest can be dissolved under certain
circumstances, including "when there is no Contestmaster and no
provision for replacing em".  Regulation 2 of the Nomic Potato states
"The Contestmaster shall be Zefram, and may not be replaced.  The
Contestmaster may resign at any time by indicating eir intent to do so
to the Public Forum".  Thus rule 1446/3, applied to the Nomic Potato,
clearly indicates that it can be destroyed.

Rule 1446/3 states that the Nomic Potato can be destroyed, and rule
1488/0 states that it cannot.  They are in conflict, and 1446/3 takes
precedence by virtue of a lower number.  Hence, the Nomic Potato can be
destroyed, and the part of rule 1488/0 that says otherwise has no legal
power.

============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Michael):

Judgement:  FALSE

Argument:  This statement is one that attempts to use the prior
           existence of a Contest called the Nomic Potato to
invalidate the claim in 1488/0 that the Entity defined there can not
be destroyed.  This argument rests on the assumption that the Entity
defined in 1488/0 has the same name as the Contest, and so to avoid
conflict with 1011/0 must be the same Entity.  (Contests can be
dissolved so, if one accepts the reasoning thus far, the clause of
1488/0 in question is invalidated by reason of it conflicting with
1466/3 "Contests".)

I attack this claim by showing that the assumption about names is
false.  In particular, rule 1488/0 nowhere claims that the Entity in
question has 'Nomic Potato' as its name.  It merely states that it is
known as the 'Nomic Potato'.  There is a world of difference between
being known as something and actually being named something.

Now, one might claim that the Nomic Potato Contest is an Entity known
as the Nomic Potato.  This is true, but it does not necessarily follow
therefore that the 1488/0 Entity is the same one.  The use of "let" in
Agora is used in a creative role; it creates a fresh instance of some
type.  Note that if 1488/0 had tried to name its Entity, then it would
have failed because of 1011/0.  It would not have suddenly merged two
distinct Entities, simply because two rules (of lesser precedence than
1011/0, which has MI = 2) asserted that they had the same name.

This argument may seem pedantic and slightly unworthy, but I believe
it is cast at the appropriate level given the circumstances in which
this CFJ was called.

Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1446/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      If the Contest Regulations require a transfer to be made, but
      the Contest Fund has insufficient currencies to permit that
      transfer to be made, sufficient currencies to cover the transfer
      shall be involuntarily transferred from the Contestmaster's
      Treasury to the Contest Fund.  The Contestmaster shall report
      this transfer to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1488/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Nomic Potato

      Let there be an Entity known as the Nomic Potato.  There is only one
      Potato which cannot be destroyed.  The Potato can be possessed by
      any Agora Player who owns Extra Votes (EVs).  A Player with no EVs
      cannot possess the Potato, and if the Player possessing the Potato
      ever ceases to own EVs, e also loses possession of the Potato.

      If the Potato's possessor ceases to possess the Potato though
      ceasing to own EVs, or ceasing to be a Player, or in any other way
      not otherwise described by the Rules pertaining to the Nomic Potato,
      the possession of the Potato immediately passes to the Player who
      owns the greatest number of EVs.

      If more than one Player is tied for the greatest number of EVs, the
      Potato is transferred to the tied Player who:
	
	i) Has not previously possessed the Potato; providing all other
	   tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

       ii) Has not possessed the Potato for the longest consecutive period
	   of time immediately prior to the Potato's transfer; providing
	   all other tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

      iii) The tied Player randomly determined by the Assessor, provided
	   neither i) or ii) apply.

      As long as at least one Player owns EVs, the Potato is always in
      some Player's possession. The only time that the Potato is not
      possessed by a Player is when no Player owns EVs.

      The Assessor keeps track of who possesses the Potato.

================= Judgement: CFJ 710 =================
Caller: the Pink Bimbo, nee Kelly
Judge: Coren
Judgement: TRUE
Injunction Granted: No Injunction
Barred: Lee, Vanyel, Einstein
Date Called: 10/24/94
Date Judged: 10/31/94
Statement: The Group Votes cast by Group MAPLSIRUP on Proposals 1271 and 
1273-1287 are invalid.

------------------------------------------------------------

Judgement Text: 
I have waited as long as possible to pass Judgement on this CFJ in an 
attempt to subpoena the pertinent documents that would support 
MAPLSIRUP's case from their Vizier, without success.  On their own head 
be it...

R767 states "The Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the 
Group casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue, the 
Group may not cast its Votes."

Paragraph 8 [sic] of MAPLSIRUP's Ordinances (which do not otherwise
address the issue of casting Votes) states "All other activities which the
Ordinances may legally limit or allow, or otherwise affect, **MAY** be
equally limited, allowed, or otherwise affected by the MAPLSIRUP Secret
Law."  (emphasis mine)

I believe that it is valid to cross reference another document in this
manner, IF and ONLY IF it can be proven completely and conclusively that
such an other document contained the necessary provisions at that time. 
The above quoted paragraph is a POTENTIALLY valid referral to a method for
"how and when the Group casts its Votes", and thus the Ordinances would
not be silent on the matter - IF SUCH CLAUSES CONTAINING VOTING PROCEDURE
ACTUALLY EXIST WITHIN MAPLSIRUP'S "SECRET LAW".  Since their Ordinances
only state that other activities MAY be allowed, this sentence in itself
does not constitute proof that such clauses actually exist. 

MAPLSIRUP Vizier Lee has assured me that such clauses existed at the time
the Group cast its Votes, and I believe him; however, as a Judge, I feel
that I must operate on more substantive evidence than "hearsay",
regardless of how much belief I may hold regarding it personally.  In my
opinion, the only thing that would prove the existance of such clauses
"completely and conclusively" is to examine the complete text of
MAPLSIRUP's "Secret Law" as it stood at the time of the submission of
their Group Votes.  Ideally, such a document should be a forwarded or
bounced copy of a message which bears a timestamp *prior* to the time the
Votes were sent, which to my mind would make it admissable as evidence. 
Unfortunately, a less-than-complete copy (i.e., excerpts) would not be
sufficient, as it leaves open the possibility that some clause that wasn't
quoted could affect the clauses quoted.
I have attempted to secure such documentation, without success; therefore,
in the absence of such complete and conclusive proof that the necessary
clauses existed at the time MAPLSIRUP submitted their Votes, I am compelled
to Judge this CFJ "TRUE". 

One final side note:  there is a paradox in the second part of paragraph 8
[sic] of MAPLSIRUP's Ordinances which I believe makes that part worthless,
and illegal should they ever try to invoke it:  it states:  "The MAPLSIRUP
Secret Law shall take precedence over the Ordinances should they
conflict."  R721 states "All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances
of that Group at all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with
the Rules." 

The sentence in question tries to outline a situation in which the 
Members of the Group do NOT have to obey their Ordinances, which is in 
violation of the first part of the sentence quoted - which means that it 
is in "conflict with the Rules", per the second part.  This means that 
the Members of MAPLSIRUP *MUST* obey their Ordinances, per r721, except 
for the second part of Ordinance [8], which is illegal.

My deepest apologies to all for the delay in this Judgement, but I felt I 
would be doing the Group in question a disservice if I did not try to 
secure all the evidence pertinent to the case.

Thank you, 

Judge Coren

===============================================
                 Original CFJ
===============================================


Arguments: Rule 767 allows a Group to cast its Votes if and only if its 
Ordinances so permit.  MAPLSIRUP's Ordinances are silent in this regard; 
therefore, by Rule 767, the Group may not Vote.  Since the action of Lee 
transmitting the Group's Votes to the Speaker is not legitimate, any 
Votes that Lee, as Vizier, attempts to cast for Group MAPLSIRUP are
invalid and shall be ignored until such time as MAPLSIRUP amends its
Ordinances to allow it to Vote. 

Group MAPLSIRUP has a body of "Secret Law", which may attempt to authorize
it to cast Votes.  However, Rule 767 says nothing about "Secret Law"; only
about Ordinances.  MAPLSIRUP Vizier Lee has informed me that the Secret
Law is not part of the Ordinances, and that it is not publically
available.  Since a Group's Ordinances are available to the public, it is
clear that this Secret Law is not a part of or equivalent to the Group's
Ordinances. 

The Ordinances of any Group are required to be publically available: the
Ordinancekeepor of a Group is an Officer (Rule 766) required by the Rules
to maintain the Ordinances (again, Rule 766).  By Rule 1064, any records
which the Rules require an Officer to maintain are always available for
public review unless the Rules specify otherwise. 

Evidence:

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.
      (*Was: 646*)

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.
      (*Was: 714*)

Rule 1064 (Mutable)
Freedom of Information Act

1064. Public Availability of Records, take II

      If an Officer is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  An
      Officer who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week, or pay
      a penalty to the Point Reserve equal to three times eir weekly
      Salary, or 10 points, whichever is greater.  The penalty does
      not apply if the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond the
      Officer's control and the Officer reports this fact, with
      explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

      The Speaker shall, within the context of this Rule, be treated
      exactly as if e were an Officer.
      (*Was: 488*)

MAPLSIRUP Ordinances:
 
 [1]  Goals of MAPLSIRUP:
        - To promote good fun, and chaos, while ruthlessly
          and mercilessly tormenting all who love order;
        - To make other Groups look foolish;
        - To increase entropy in Agora
        - To promote the passage of blatantly silly Proposals;
        - To generally promulgate an atmosphere of general mayhem, silliness
        and chaos.

 [2]  The Charterers of MAPLSIRUP shall be Vanyel, Lee, Einstein. 
      If at any time any of these persons are a Player and wish to become
      a Member of MAPLSIRUP, they shall be automatically accepted as Members.

 [3]  The Members of MAPLSIRUP shall be Vanyel, Lee, Einstein.
      This Ordinance shall be Amended to add any new Member's name in reverse
      alphabetical order whenever a new Member joins, and shall be Amended
      to delete any Member's name when e leaves the Group.

 [4]  The Vizier of MAPLSIRUP shall be Lee. If at any time the Vizier ceases
      to be the Vizier in such a way that there might possibly not be a
      Vizier, then the Member whose average of all digits in their Point total 
      is closest to 5 shall be the new Vizier.  In case of a tie new Vizier is 
      the Player whose Honour is closest to 20 kudos.  

 [5]  The OrdinanceKeepor shall be the Vizier.

 [6] There is no Rule 6.

 [8]  All other activities which the Ordinances may legally limit or allow,
      or otherwise affect, may be equally limited, allowed, or otherwise
      affected by the MAPLSIRUP Secret Law. The MAPLSIRUP Secret Law shall
      take precedence over the Ordinances should they conflict.

Protoproposal Birthday-1

Let the following Rule be created:

Birthdays

  A Player may inform the Registrar of his or her Birthday.
If they do so, then on that day they may select and receive
ONE (1) of the following 'presents':
   Three EV's
   Two Win Tokens created and given to them
   Two Blots erased (as long as neither Blot is the
recipient's last Blot)
   One Kudo created and given to them
   The ability to submit up to 20 Proposals on that
day without penalty
   
In addition, all Players are hereby encouraged to
wish the recipient a Happy Birthday.
  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule preventing
the recipient from receiving any of the above presents.

[FYI, my birthday is Nov. 23, so I will probably be the
last Player to derive any advantage from this Rule]

--------------------------------------
   
Protoproposal Travel-1

Let the Following Rule be created:

Greetings from Overseas!

Any time a Player travels to a foreign country,
he/she shall announce that fact in the Public Forum
at least one week before he/she departs (if possible).
Any other Player may then request the traveller to
send him/her a postcard from the destination country,
as long as the Player does so before the traveller
departs. The traveller is then obligated to do so,
provided the Player requesting a postcard provides
his/her address.
  For the purposes of this Rule, "travel to a foreign
country" can include intermediate destinations
if applicable, but does not include any destination which
lies in the traveller's native country, country of
residence, or any nation in which the traveller spends 
less than 48 contiguous hours.
 Violation of this Rule is a Class D Crime.

[Note, as a Classical Archaeologist, this Rule will
apply to me as much as anyone.]

And what of me? Being a Dutch living in France I am 90% of my time
in a foreign countries.

Chuck's idea might be saved if he writes "travels to another continent"
or "makes a trip of more than 2000 kilometers".

Subject: BUS: CFJ on the interpretation of Rule 1023
Sender: owner-nomic-business@teleport.com
Precedence: bulk
Reply-To: nomic-discussion@teleport.com
Status: RO

Statement:

Rule 1023 shall be interpreted, such that for each action which a
Player is obliged to perform, but fails to perform, within the time
required by this Rule is a separate and distinct Crime, and
furthermore each action performed by a Player in an order which is
inconsistent with the requirements of this Rule is itself a Crime
separate and distinct from each other such action, and from any Crime
for failure to meet the time requirement.

i bar nobody from this CFJ, and i request than an Injunction be issued
to annotate Rule 1023 with this Statement.  the list of Relevant Rules
is Rule 1023.

Argument:

it has never been well-established what it means to violate this Rule.
i am making this CFJ to try to establish a consistent judicial
precedent for the proper interpretation of Rule 1023.

i will not complicate the example by dealing with 1023's parallel duty
tracks; obviously, duties on different duty tracks are independent of
each other and can be performed in any order.  1023 gives every Player
one duty track for each Office e holds, plus one more for duties not
pertaining to any Office, so Officers have more leeway in ordering
their Moves.  all times in the following illustration are measured in
days, for simplicity.

let us presume, throughout, that at time T=0 a Player who holds no
Offices incurs a duty D0, at time T=1 e incurs another duty D1, and at
time T=5 e incurs a third duty D2.  let us now examine several
possible orderings and timings of fulfillment of these duties, and the
Crimes which would arise from these various orders.

of course, the "desired" order is to perform D0 no later than T=7, D1
no later than T=8, and D2 no later than T=12, and such that D0 is
performed before D1 and D1 performed before D2.

first, let us approach order: if the duties are discharged in the
order D0,D1,D2, there are no Crimes for ordering.  if they are
discharged in the order D1,D0,D2 the order D0,D2,D1, or the order
D2,D0,D1, there is one Crime (because there is only a single action
taken out of order).  if they are discharged in the order D2,D1,D0 or
the order D1,D2,D0 then there are two Crimes, because D0 was
unfulfilled at the time that both D1 and D2 were performed.  each
Violation consists of performing a properly subsequent duty while one
or more properly precedent duties remain unfulfilled.

the case of timing is simpler: the failure to perform a duty before
the latest time permitted (that is, seven days, except when another
Rule specifies, in which case this Rule has no bearing) is a Crime.
so, in the above example, if the Player does not fulfill duty D0 before
time T=7, e commits a Crime, regardless of when e performed duties D1
or D2.

New (?) Proposals 2029-2030

I still haven't received Proposals 2029-2030 back from the listserver,
so I assume that it's having a problem.  In any case, I distributed
these proposals 3 hours ago; this distribution, and the notifications
contained herein, are copies, except for the corrected notification
of quorum.

=====================================================================

These proposals were omitted from the previous batch.  I believe that
in the confusion surrounding the transfer of the Promotor's office,
someone must have forgotten that these were actually submitted to
the Public Forum and not to the Promotor by private e-mail.

Steve's proposal (Fix New Player Bonuses) and the Green Repeals
still have the status of unsubmitted Proposals, as does my own
(Nomic Firewall).

The quorum for these Proposals is 10, and not 8 as earlier reported.
The quorum for 2020 - 2028 is also 10.

Voting Period ends on November 27 (GMT) but a few hours after that of 
2020-2028.  A.I. is 1.

  Morendil receives 5 points for the week of October 30-November 5
  for submitting a proposal at Date: Mon, 6 Nov 1995 00:40:33 +0001,
  which I take to be November 5 in GMT.

Proposal 2029 (Vanyel) AI=1, protoed
Axe the Assistant

Whereas the Office of Assistant receives a salary for doing very little
      work, and

Whereas the current duties of the Offices of Archivist and Assistant are
      very similar, and even coincide in some ways,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 839 be repealed, and

Be it also resolved that Rule 417 shall be Amended to read as follows:
 
      Let there be an office known as the Nomic Archivist, which shall
      be governed by the default Rules concerning Offices. The duties of
      the Archivist shall be as follows:

      * to record the passage and failure of Proposals,

      * to maintain the Historical Ruleset, a document which includes
        all rules ever to exist as part of the Agora Ruleset, annotated
        with the periods of time they were in effect, and what Proposals
        or Rules enacted them.
      
      * to maintain a list of Judgements and their case histories,

      * to maintain copies of prior Officer reports, and

      * to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.

      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as e
      sees fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited from the
      historical material.  The Archivist is free to design a
      classification method for the material e stores.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the Agora
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.
     
      The salary of the Archivist shall be 5 points.

{Comments: I consolidated the Assistant and Archivist Offices into
 a single Office, brought the sloppy language of the old Archivist
 rule into line with our more recent technically accurate language,
 and updated the Archivist duties to more closely coincide with what
 I actually do.}

first proto: Sun 22 Oct 1995
proposed: Sun 5 Nov 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 2030 (Morendil) AI=1, protoed
Repeal 939

 Rule 939 is repealed.

But we can only submit 5 CFJ's per week, so it would take quite some
time, and anyone can remove a Blot by spending 5 Points. The only way to
do it realisticly would be to time the CFJ's such that all Blot-less
Players would get Blots fast enough that nobody would be able to
respond. And you would even have to hope that nobody who already had
Blots eliminated them.

Now, if Blots were a bit harder to get rid of, or if they had a minimum
duration, then this would be a viable way to Win, and would be a
tremendous amount of fun... <grin> 


Enjoy!

The thought of virtual real estate (esp as a reward for something) sounded
intriguing to me... thus the proto:

<PROTO>
Protoproposal P000

Create a rule entitled "Position" with text:

        Every Nomic Entity has a Position, which is an ordered pair of
integers. If an entity's position is not defined elsewhere, it has the
default position of (0,0). Entities whose position is _defined_ to be (0,0)
elsewhere are not considered to have the default position.

        Agora Nomic has the position (0,0)

Create a rule entitled "Property" with text:

        Positions may be owned by a single Player, Organization, Nomic.
Other types of Entities, or groups of Entities, may only own Positions if
so allowed by the Rules. Positions may only be owned as described by the
Rules.

        Agora Nomic owns the position (0,0)

Create a rule entitled "The Realtor" with text:

        There exists the Office of the Realtor. The Realtor is responsible
for maintaining the position of all entities with non-default positions,
and ownership of positions. Once per week the Realtor shall post a Property
report, listing all non-default positions and owned positions, and changes
in such information since the previous report. The Realtor's salary is one
point per week.

Directive: Install Pascal as Realtor
</PROTO>

Not a very purposeful system yet...
I personally would find having a piece of property somewhere (with a
description or something I could set...) almost as satsfying as a Win...
especially if it was allowed for ex-players to own stuff, acting as kind of
a record.

sort of Pascal, (*7/6), (*8/6), (*9/6) .... (*13498984329239/6)
(as if _that_ would ever happen)
versus having a virtual statue of myself somewhere. or something.

We would like to Call for Judgement on the following statement:

-----
STATEMENT: 
An Organization's Compact cannot specify any method of expanding it's
Jurisdiction which is not specifically and explicitly allowed for in the
Rules. 
-----
BARRED: 
We would like to Bar any Player who was declared (whether successfully or 
not) as part of the Triumvirate during the Mousetrap Scam.  (Note that 
Rule 869/2 makes this a valid method to identify a Player, as it is 
unambiguous; we're just not sure who those three Players were...) 
-----
ARGUMENTS:
A Compact cannot require any actions of someone outside it's Jurisdiction. 
Therefore, since any prospective Player is by definition outside the
Compact's Jurisdiction, the Compact cannot cause (or coerce) that Player
to be included within it's Jurisdiction. 
-----
EVIDENCE:
"Statutes: ... must be obeyed by Players within the Compact's
Jurisdiction..." [Rule 1529/0]

"A Compact has no force to require, or oblige, anything of Players who
are not within its Jurisdiction... This Rule takes precedence over any
other Rule governing Compacts." [Rule 1530/0]

Agorans wishing to include the full and correct text of any Rule can
now use the Nomic macro preprocessor ! This new service is hosted
by cdrompro.com.

To use, send your Judgement, Official Report or whatever to one of:
  preproc-discussion@cdrompro.com
  preproc-business@cdrompro.com
  preproc-official@cdrompro.com
and include within a macro of the form
  <RXXXX>
where XXXX is the number of a Rule.

Your mail will be bounced to the appropriate Agora list, with macros 
expanded to full Rules.

I'll welcome any suggestions on how 'preproc' can be developed into 
an even more useful service to the Agoran community. Please remember 
that 'preproc' is just out of testing and there may still be some 
kinks that I haven't ironed out yet.

PROTO: Title and Section Numbers for Rules

(Yet another Proto inspired by the comment, "it couldn't be done." This
 time in reaction to my Rule Numbering Proto.  This, in fact, is a revised
 version of my first Proposal "Indexing the Logical Ruleset," which
 I still think is a good idea-- though the idea is much better written
 now :)

Let the Following Rule be Created (Title Number of Rules):

     Each Category of the Logical Ruleset shall have associated with it
     a unique Title Number.  Such Title Numbers shall be integers
     greater than zero. The Rulekeepor shall give each
     newly-created Category a Title Number when it is created.  The
     Title Number given to a Category shall be the least integer greater
     than all other Title Numbers previously given to a Category.
     Once a Category has been given a Title Number, it shall not be
     changed except as specified in the Rules.

     Upon adoption of this Rule, Initial Title Numbers shall be applied
     by the Rulekeepor to the existing Categories of the Logical
     Ruleset. These Title Numbers shall be applied to the existing
     Categories, in the order they appear in the Logical Ruleset. Once
     all existing Categories are so Numbered, this paragraph shall
     repeal itself.

     All Rules within a specific Category have the same Title Number
     as that Category.

{Comment: Title Number might be confused with Rule Titles, if so we can    
dispense with the strict legalism of "Title" and call this a Category Number.  
This language is based on a more-or-less strict analogy with Rule Numbers}

Let the following Rule be created (Section Number of Rules):

     Each Rule has associated with it a Section Number denoting its
     relative position within its Category.  Such Section Numbers shall
     be integers greater than zero. The Rulekeepor shall give each
     newly-created Rule a Section Number when it is created.  The
     Rulekeepor shall give a Rule a new Section Number whenever the
     Category of that Rule is changed. The Section Number given to a
     Rule shall be the least integer greater than all other Section
     Numbers previously given to a Rule within the Category in which the
     Rule appears.  Once a Rule has been given a Section Number, it
     shall not be changed except as specified in this and other Rules.
 
     Upon adoption of this Rule, Initial Section Numbers shall be
     applied by the Rulekeepor to the existing Rules within the Logical
     Ruleset. These Section Numbers shall be applied to the existing
     Rules, one Category at a time, in the order of Numerical precedence
     (ignoring precedence claims within the Rules themselves.) Once
     all existing Rules are so Numbered, this paragraph shall repeal
     itself.


Let the following Rule be Created (Referencing by Title and Section Numbers)

     It shall be an unambiguous way to specify a Rule by referring to it
     by its Title and Section Numbers.  Such a specification must
     include both Numbers in the form XXX.YYY, where XXX is the Title
     Number and YYY is the Section Number.  This Rule takes precedence
     over any Rule that would invalidate this method of referring to
     Rules.

{Comment: At the moment, all this will do is make it a tad easier to
          find a Rule in the Logical Ruleset (each Rule would have a
          Number pointing to its category.)  However, this is a step
          toward kelly's suggestion of a full-blown tiered system.
          Consider, once each rule is so numbered, we  could dispense
          with Rule Numbers as such with a few amendments to the
          precedence rules. (The reason I worded the initial Section
          Numbering so.) Of course it's a little more complex than this,
          we'd want to reorganize Categories and legislate a means to
          change their Title Numbers, at the very least, before we base
          precedence, even partially, on Category, but in the long run,
          with a logical set up to the Categories, it might actually
          make more sense than the current system.}

Now that kelly's re-registered, I have a puzzle: kelly was the
only Contestant in the Contest at the time e deregistered last
game.  E had contributed 5 Marks to the Treasury, and there was
a Bet in existence associated with em.  What's the status now?
The Contest still exists: is kelly a Contestant?  If not, is
the Bet still associated with em?  Is there a clear answer to
this, or does it need a CFJ?  I'll attach the Regs.

| favor |

CONTEST: The Win Bookie

Regulations:

1. The Entry Fee for this Contest shall be 5 Marks.

2. At any time after joining the Contest, each Contestant may
   send the Contestmaster a Bet Application, marked as such and
   naming a Player who is the Target for that Bet Application.
   For each Bet Application beyond the first that a given
   Contestant sends to the Contestmaster, that Contestant
   must transfer an additional 5 Marks to the Contest Treasury.

3. Exactly one week after a Bet Application is sent to the
   Contestmaster, it becomes a Bet.  The Target of a Bet is
   the same as the Target of the corresponding Bet Application,
   and the Owner of a Bet is the Contestant who sent the
   Bet Application.

3. When a Player Wins a Game of Agora Nomic, the following shall occur:
   * If any Contestant is the Owner of a Bet whose Target is the
     winning Player, half the treasury is divided among the Contestants,
     weighted linearly according to the number of Bets each
     Contestant Owns with the winning Player as Target.
   * Every Contestant must transfer 1 Mark to the Contest Treasury
     for each Bet of eirs that is still in effect.

4. A Contestant may leave the Contest at any time by sending a message
   to the Contestmaster notifying em.  When a Contestant does this,
   all Bet Applications sent by that Contestant, and all Bets Owned
   by that Contestant, cease to exist.

5. The Contestmaster may transfer the Contestmastership to any
   consenting Player of Agora Nomic.

6. The Contestmaster shall send a list of all current Bets and
   Bet Applications to any Contestant upon request.

7. The regulations may be changed at any time by unanimous agreement
   of the Contestants, and the consent of the Contestmaster.

But if an entity is just a bundle of properties, it follows that an 
entity before a change is not the same entity as the entity after a change.
Thus, entities cannot be changed at all. Which may very well be what 
those metaphysics conclude, but certainly not appropriate for Agora.

In fact, existence being a property cannot make sense if an 
entity is not something beside its properties.

_Only_ philosophical reflection? You may be able to sweep philosophy 
under the rug if you never think about abstract concepts, but not while 
playing Agora!

Events, yes, but not necessarily changes of properties.

Please don't formulate your Proposals in such a way as to depend on
unresolved philosophical issues. Resolve them in the Proposal, if
necessary. (We all love metaphysical Rules, don't we?)

Only if you think of "sameness" as mathematical "identity", ie a
determinate, all or nothing, one-one, relation. I suggest that we
think of one entity as the same as another if enough of its
properties survive. This is the sense in which you are the same
person as you were yesterday. This makes "sameness" a matter of
degree (instead of being all or nothing). Derek Parfit, who uses
such a notion in talking about sameness of persons, calls this
"personal survival", in contrast to "personal identity". I am 
arguing for similar talk of "entity survival" rather than "entity
identity".

It could be a second order property of properties.

Yes, but this is a seperate and distinct Entity from a CFJ in the form
"This Move is illegal". In fact, one creates Blots if Judged TRUE, while
the other does not.

Depending on your point of view. We define the underlying metaphysics of
the Game according to the Rules in existance at the time, rather than
the ideal situation. May be suggest a Rule which creates another term
for all possible moves which may be made, and maintain "Move" as the
term for moves which have been made? We believe that Move has already
been absorbed by the Rule Set and would require major invasive surgery
to change it's meaning. There are bound to be complications...

None, but it allows for the creation of an Entity which was not legal to
create before. If such an action is not considered to be an Event, then
we need to rethink the whole system again, else there are going to be
many loopholes...

Perhaps it's just a difference of opinion upon the definition of Entity.
We use entity in general to describe the existance of any single thing,
whether it be tangible or intangible. A Nomic Entity is an entity which
can be affected by or affects the Game of Nomic. Oftentimes, we say
"Entity" when we intend to indicate a Nomic Entity, since it's usually
common sense whether it applies in Nomic or not. 

Game Entity on the other hand is a term defined by the Rules as those
Entities which are defined and affected ONLY within the Game. Thus, Game
Entities are a subset of Nomic Entities. For example, we consider
Players to be a Nomic Entity, although not a Game Entity. Groups, on the
other hand, have no existance outside Nomic, therefore they are a Game
Entity. 

Greem would not be an Entity because green is an adjective; an Entity
must by definition be a noun. Greenness may be, depending on its usage,
since Greenness is a condition which may exist in any number of
situations and thus could be considered to have a seperate existance
from the object which one is using to describe as possessing Greenness.

A good parallel would be an email address. We would consider an email
address to be an Entity, although not a Game Entity. It is a thing (a
collection of characters with a special significance) and it has an
independant existance (it can be changed without directly affecting 
anything else). It is a Nomic Entity, since it affects the Game, but
it's not a Game Entity, since it exists outside the confines of the
Rules. If it were somehow included as a Game Entity, then it would be
illegal to change or affect one's email address except as allowed for in
the Rules. Bad ju-jus.

     Please register me as a player.  Is this all I have to do?  Rule 
     869 seems a bit vague in that respect (at least to this new 
     player).  Thanks.

Protoproposal kelly.4 [rev. 1]

Officers Freed of Every Flaw

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 is amended to read:

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.  At any time, for each Office there shall be exactly
      one Officer who holds it.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 790 be amended to read:

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been either retired or removed from
      it.  An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said
      to be held temporarily.

      As soon as possible after it occurs that there is an Office
      which is being held temporarily, and for which no Election is
      already being conducted, the Registrar shall initiate an
      Election to fill that Office, as described elsewhere.  The
      winner of that Election shall then hold that Office until e
      resigns or is retired or removed from that Office.  

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      When an Officer resigns from or is retired from an Office, e
      ceases to hold it in the normal fashion, but continues to hold
      the Office temporarily.  When an Officer is removed from Office,
      the Speaker shall become the temporary holder of that Office,
      unless another Rule specifies a different Player who is to
      become the temporary holder of that Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 880 be amended to read:

      An Officer is permitted to, at any time, remove eirself from any
      Office e holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  This
      Player must explicitly and publically consent to becoming the
      new holder of that Office, except when that Player is the
      Speaker.  The Speaker is presumed to always consent to being
      assigned as a temporary Officer.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Unless otherwise specified, the Term of Service for an Office
      shall expire three calendar months after the first day of the
      month following the month the Officer in question was elected to
      that Office.  At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service,
      the Officer holding that Office shall be retired from that
      Office.

      This Rule defers to Rules which specify a different Term of
      Service for specific Offices.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If an Officer goes On Hold, e shall immediately be removed from
      every Office e holds.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, each Officer shall receive
      the designated salaries for the Office(s) e holds, provided that
      e has held them for the entire five days preceding without
      interruption.  The Registrar shall detect and report all
      transfer resuling from the payment of fixed weekly Salaries.

      Unless otherwise specified, the salary for an Office is 3
      Points.  

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1486 be amended, by deleting the
phrase, ", and that Office becomes Vacant".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 806 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1450 be amended to read:

      The Speaker shall never hold either of the Office of Clerk of
      the Courts or the Office of Justiciar in the normal fashion.  If
      the Clerk of the Courts or the Justiciar becomes Speaker, e is
      immediately retired from whichever of those Offices e holds.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1484 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 901 be amended, by deleting the
sentence, "A vacant Office of Justiciar is filled by an Election."
from the first paragraph, and also by deleting the last three
paragraphs of that Rule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1436 be amended, by replacing the
first paragraph with the sentence, "Let there exist the Office of
Tabulator."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1375 be amended, by deleting the
words "the Office of Registrar is vacant, or" from the first
paragraph.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      When the Rules require that an Election be conducted to fill
      an Office, that Election shall be conducted in accordance with
      the usual Rules for Elections, except that the Vote Collector
      shall be the Registrar, and no Player may be Nominated who would
      not be permitted to hold the Office which the Election is
      seeking to fill.

This is very interesting... :)

I am currently setting up a global database of Players, basically so 
that a) Scorekeepor eats up as little of my time as possible and b) I 
can have an idea of any Player's status at any time. Of course the 
time benefits of this are purely illusory since I will probably spend 
twice as much setting up my Perl programs than it would have taken me 
to record scores manually, but what the heck - it's the principle 
that counts. :)

I do intend to ultimately put these scripts and commands at the 
diposal of any Player, so that a majority of game actions can be 
automated - however, I will certainly *never* require as Scorekeepor 
that Players use these interfaces.

I suggest you do the same - if you get Proposals sent to your mailbox 
or the PF, set up your mailer to forward them to your scripts. There 
shouldn't be a danger of Agora becoming unplayable when some server 
goes down or whatever.

Yes.  At the core of an Entity, there is a non-Property thing, which I
keep wanting to call "its entity", except that seems to be a circular
argument.  Perhaps "its existence" would be better, I'm not sure.  But
basically it's this: Properties can not, in and of themselves, exist.
They can only exist insofar as they are possessed by an Entity.  Thus an
Entity is more than "just a bundle of properties"; it has something else
at its core, which is totally nondescript (as soon as it becomes
distinct, it is possessing properties) yet unique.  It is this which
remains the same throughout the existence of the Entity, though
properties may change radically, and it is the uniqueness of this which
prevents otherwise identical Entities from being "the same".  Am I
making sense?

Sure, that works.  "Dasein"... I like that.

PROTO: Agoraspace v2.1

Let the following Rule be created (Agoraspace):

     The Agoraverse is the virtual multidimensional space of infinite 
     extent and dimension in which exist all Entities defined in the
     Ruleset, other than the Agoraverse itself.  Agoraspace is that
     subset of the Agoraverse that adheres to Euclidean geometry.  
     All Entities, other than Agoraspace, exist within the bounds of 
     Agoraspace, unless explicitly permitted otherwise by the Rules.

     There is a specific mathematical point within Agoraspace known as 
     the Origin.  All references to location within Agoraspace shall be 
     made with reference to the Origin, explicitly or implicitly.

     All Entities within Agoraspace, whose location is otherwise 
     unspecified, are located at the Origin. The Origin is, at all 
     times, a permissible location for an Entity to exist.

{Comment:  The base of the pyramid which generally defines the core of
           the idea, and permitting favor's infinite dimensionally w/o 
           getting out of hand about it.  Gives a default location for 
           everything to orbit around.

           v2.1-- for kelly, rewrote this whole thing, allowing for the
           possibility for non-Euclidean spaces to exist in a wider 
           Agoraverse.  Also, I rewrote this so the Origin isn't 
           hardwired into the definition of space, so we don't, 
           necessarily, have to have a preferential reference frame the 
           Origin is simply the reference point now, and the coord. 
           system will be defined in terms of the origin, not vice 
           versa. Note, this will probably be the only place I mention
           "point" in terms of geometry, the potential for confusion is 
           just too great.}

Let the following rule be created (Coordinates in Agoraspace):

     When no other means of specifying a location exists within 
     Agoraspace, the location shall be specified in terms of a Cartesian 
     coordinate system whose axes are fixed relative to the Origin.  The 
     values of all coordinates in this system shall be zero at the 
     Origin.  When the Rules refer to an X, Y, or Z axis, they shall be
     the first three axes of this coordinate system.

{Comment: v2.1-- I need a fixed Cartesian system for some of my later
                 rules, but it's now defined to not be the exclusive
                 coordinate system, or to be preferential. Now the
                 Origin could move, rotate, accelerate, and these Rules
                 wouldn't be affected.}


Let the following Rule be created (Units of Measure):

     The official unit of linear measure within Agoraspace is the cimon.  
     All measurements of distance in Agoraspace shall be made in cimon.  
     SI prefixes can be used to specify larger or smaller distances 
     without ambiguity.  (1 kilocimon = 1000 cimons = 1,000,000 
     milicimons.)  All Entities within Agoraspace extend zero cimons in
     all dimensions unless explicitly defined otherwise in the Rules.

     The official unit of angular measure within Agoraspace is the 
     agorad. Agorads divide a circumference into one-thousandths.
     (1 agorad = 0.36 degrees.)

{Comment: Since no one has yet drafted a full coordinate system for
          Agora, I guess it's not surprising that everyone forgot a unit
          of measure. 

          v2.1-- kelly suggested a different name for the units, so I
          came up with "cimon" which actually sounds somewhat elegant,
          as well as sounding like a unit of measure.  I pronounce it
          "simon." (For those of you who haven't noticed, it's "nomic"
          backwards.)  I've also moved the definition of agorad here &
          changed the name of the rule since I've dumped the quantizing
          idea. (Note: I've squashed the capitals for you Oerjan.)
          I also changed the default entity size to zero, so they'll
          "fit" within whatever surface they're confined in. (also so
          they're aren't occupying undefined dimensions by accident.)}


Let the following Rule be created (The Cartographor):

     There is an Office known as the Cartographor.  The Cartographor is 
     the Officer in charge of maintaining a general record of Agoraspace 
     as well as the coordinates of all Players.

     Every other Nomic Week, the Cartographor is required to generate a 
     Map of Agoraspace, as defined in other Rules.  However, whatever 
     other Rules may Require, the Map must contain the following 
     coordinates:

       i) Those of every Player.
      ii) Those of every Entity whose coordinates are not at the Origin.
     iii) Those of every Entity that the Rules require the Cartographor 
          to maintain the coordinates of.

     The Cartographor's salary shall be four points.

{Comment: Yes, its another @#$%& Officer.  What can I say, someone has
          to do all the recordkeeping.

          v2.1-- Fixed the spelling goof and the missing "as."}


Let the following Rule be created (Bounding Agoraspace):

     All Entities in Agoraspace shall only exist at those locations, 
     or sets of locations, wherein the Rules expressly give permission 
     for those Entities to exist.  Within such boundaries, all Entities 
     which are permitted to exist at a location may all coexist at 
     that coordinate without limit.

     All Entities, except Players, change their location-- or have 
     their location change-- only as permitted by the Rules.  If the 
     Rules are silent as to the movement of an Entity or type of Entity, 
     such an Entity cannot move. Players can change their location in 
     any way not expressly forbidden by the Rules, by sending a message 
     detailing the movement to the Cartographor.

{Comment: More default restrictions.  Without one of the following
          rules, this effectively restricts everything to the Origin.
          It allows Entities to coexist as a default and allows Players
          to move as they wish (within the Rules) while limiting all
          other Entities to only move as permitted.
          
          v2.1-- kelly pointed out that more than one set of coordinates
          can refer to the same point (location) so I reworded the Rule.
          I personally prefer allowing the permissive model for Player
          movement.  It would be interesting having Players joyride
          around while the Rules are being drafted.  (someone might get
          stranded even :)} 

======================================================================

Three Options for the "Surface" of Agora.

Wonder of wonders, I did all of these without once resorting to
mathematical notation.  Needless to say, the three options become
progressively more complex while remaining, essentially, two
dimensional.

(Actually, the sphere and torus are sort of 2.1 dimensional, since the
Origin is always included in places to be, even if it isn't on the
surface, and I am *not* going to go to the hassle of defining these
surfaces so the Origin is on the surface.)


Option #1-------------------------------------------------------------
Let the following rule be created (The Agoradisk):

     The Agoradisk is a two dimensional disk centered on the Origin.  It 
     lies on the XY plane and its radius is one kilocimon.  Entities 
     within Agoraspace are constrained to exist only within the 
     locations contained within the Agoradisk.

     Locations within the Agoradisk can be specified by at least one
     pair of coordinates.  The first coordinate is the location's
     longitude, which is an angle measured clockwise around the disk 
     from the positive X axis.  The second coordinate is the location's 
     latitude, which is the location's linear distance from the Origin.

{Comment: This is the simplest bounded space to talk about, a circle
          floating in empty space.

          v2.1--I borrowed kelly's wording, to an extent.  I still want
          the 2d surface floating within an existing Nd space.  I also
          think if we define the place, we should also define a
          coordinate system to go with it.  Changed the name of the
          thing to Agoradisk per _many_ requests.  Changed the surface
          references to polar coords.}


Option #2--------------------------------------------------------------
Let the following rule be created (The Agorasphere):

     The Agorasphere is the surface of a three dimensional sphere
     centered on the Origin.  The Agorasphere intersects the X, Y and Z
     axes, and has a radius of one kilocimon. Entities within Agoraspace
     are constrained to exist only within the locations contained within
     the Agorasphere, or the Origin.

     The circle where the XY plane Z = 0 intersects the Agorasphere is 
     the Equator.  The location where the positive Z axis intersects the
     Agorasphere is the North Pole. The location where the negative
     Z axis intersects the Agorasphere is the South Pole.

     All locations upon the Agorasphere can be specified by at least one 
     pair of coordinates. The first coordinate is the location's 
     longitude, which is an angle measured clockwise from the positive X 
     axis.  The second coordinate is the location's latitude, which is 
     measured from the positive Z axis to the negative Z axis.

{Comment: This is complex, despite its apparent simplicity.  Calculating
          distances requires a conversion to Cartesian coordinates, and
          (as worded) all minimal-distance travel routes must be on
          great circles.  If you're interested, the Agorasphere has
          about 12.6 million square cimons to compare with Agoaplane's
          3.1 million.  If I calculated everything right, the separation
          between parallels is 2pi cimons.

          v2.1--Again, I used kelly's language, to an extent.  I also
          fixed a confusion as to location vs. coordinate.  I simplified
          the language a lot, and ended up with a shorter rule.}

Option #3--------------------------------------------------------------
Let the following rule be created (The Agorus):

     The Agorus is the surface of a three dimensional torus centered on 
     the Origin and the Z axis.  The Agorus intersects the XY plane, has 
     a major radius of one kilocimon, and a minor radius of one-half 
     kilocimon.  (The Agorus' surface is that generated by rotating a 
     base circle completely around the Z axis.  This base circle lies in 
     the XZ plane, is one-half kilocimon in radius, and is centered on 
     the point upon the X axis one kilocimon away from the Origin in the 
     positive X direction.) Entities within Agoraspace are constrained 
     to exist only within the locations contained within the Agorus, or 
     the Origin.

     The circles where the XY plane Z = 0 intersects the Agorus are 
     known as the Equators.  The smaller is the Inner Equator (radius = 
     one-half kilocimon.)  The larger is the Outer Equator (radius = one 
     and one-half kilocimon.)  The circle on Agorus where Z = +0.5 
     kilocimons is the North Parallel.  The circle on Agorus where Z = -
     0.5 kilocimons is the South Parallel.

     All locations upon the Agorasphere can be specified by at least one 
     pair of coordinates. The first coordinate is the location's 
     longitude, which is an angle measured clockwise from the positive X 
     axis.  The second coordinate is the location's latitude, which is 
     an angle measured around Agorus' circular cross-section starting 
     from the North Parallel, towards the Outer Equator.

{Comment: There's popular demand for a torus, so here one is. This looks
          almost as complex as it is, but I managed to do it without
          resorting to one long equation.  (I happen to be writing a
          novel about a toroidal planet.)  This has a surface area of
          19.7 million square cimons.  I don't even want to think about
          calculating distances on the surface.  (And just imagine the
          headaches the gravity in my novel is giving me) The 
          separation between parallels is half that on Agorasphere.
          (Equal to pi cimons.) 

          v2.1-- ditto everything I said about Agorasphere here.}

I've just revised, and sent, my Agoraspace PROTO taking into account various
comments.  Having worked out the three basic options for an Agora surface, I
came up with a very bizzare thought-- why need the three options be
mutually exclusive?  (kelly, this is why embedded spaces are useful, the
following idea couldn't be implemented w/o embedding Agora in a larger
multidimentional space.)

Consider the great Agorasphere, a spherical surface centered on the origin.
_Within that surface_ we inscribe Agorus, the toroidal surface, and incribe it
so that it's Outer Equator occupies the exact same circle as Agorasphere's
Equator.  Then we fill the hole in the Agorus, with the Agoradisk, so that
 the circle that describes Agoradisk's outer perimeter is exactly the same
as the Inner Equator of the Agorus. . .

The cross section would look like this:

                   ******
                 *        *     * = The surface of Agorasphere
                *          *    @ = The surface of Agorus
               * @@@    @@@ *   - = The surface of Agoradisk
               *@   @  @   @*   # = Where you can travel from 
               #    ~--~    #       Agorus to Agorasphere and vice versa
               *@   @  @   @*   ~ = Where you can travel from
               * @@@    @@@ *       Agoradisk to Agorus and vice versa
                *          *
                 *        *
                   ******


Just a thought...
maybe not :)

a basis is Cartesian if and only if the unit vectors are orthonormal.
one can have a basis which fully descibes the space, where the axes
are not mutually orthogonal.  such a basis is not Cartesian (but is
still a basis).

of course, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates are not
linear, so it's not meaningful to discuss their unit vectors or
whether or not they are orthonormal.

the most general way i've encountered to describe the location of an
point in n-space is to have n families of surfaces of codimension 1.
each family must completely fill the space, and not intersect each
other (except possibly in a finite number of points).  a point is then
described by the (unique) set formed by choosing one surface from each
of these n families such that those surfaces all intersect only in
that one point.

to illustrate: Cartesian coordinates in 2-space use the family of
vertical lines and the family of horizontal lines.  polar coordinates
in 2-space use the family of circles centered on the origin and the
family of rays eminating from the origin.  spherical coordinates in
3-space use the family of spheres centered on the origin, and two
families of half-planes (one corresponding to each angular parameter).
cylindrical coordinates use the family of right circular cylinders
centered on the z axis, the family of planes perpendicular to the z
axis, and the family of half-planes where the z-axis forms the
boundary of each half-plane.

obviously, there are an infinitude of other possibile coordinizations
of n-space.  the standard ones are only used because they are
convenient and/or obvious.

coordinizating spaces of infinite dimension is more complicated, and i
don't want to get into it.  bases of infinite dimension are
unpleasant.

i have never actually seen anyone use a non-linear coordinization of a
space of dimension greater than 3.

Oh, one of the things I like about philosophy is that by definition, 
it doesn't require formal schooling. It's supposed to be something 
you can do on your own. :)

One does not have to be a philosopher, for instance, to reflect that 
'redness' can be a distinct complex of things that _do_ have 
individual existence. Redness is embodied in the different words that 
mean 'red' in different languages, by the cells of the retina that 
enable us to perceive things as 'red', etc. You could say that before 
a book can be red, 'redness' has to exist by itself.

This Judgement seems plausible on the face of it - until one considers
the timing of the allegedly Criminal acts.

Consider the ordering D2, D0, D1. Kelly argued that this is one Crime,
since only one action is out of sequence. Judge Bowen wants to say
that it's two Crimes, since both D0 and D1 ought to precede D2. This
makes it appear as if Kelly and Bowen hold equally good views. But
the appearance is deceptive. Kelly's view has a great advantage and
Bowen's a correspondingly great disadvantage: in Kelly's view, the
single Crime which is committed is committed *when D2 is performed*.
This is a great advantage of Kelly's view since it maintains the
intuitively plausible view that the time a Crime is committed is the
time that the Criminal act is performed. On Bowen's view, the Crimes
are committed when D0 and D1 are performed. Of course, Bowen will say
that it is the performance of D0 and D1 which are Criminal, and so it
is natural to tie the timing of the Crime to the timing of these acts.

But I deny that it is the performance of D0 and D1 in themselves that
constitutes the Crime. Clearly, it is the performance of D2 out of turn
which is the problem. If the required ordering is D0, D1, D2, then
we can already tell, once D2 has been performed, that a Crime has
been committed. Why then must we wait, as Bowen would have us do,
for D0 and D1 to be performed to find out when the crime is committed?
What if D0 and D1, for whatever reason, are *never* performed? This
would leave us with the absurd situation of knowing that a Crime
has been committed without being able to say - even roughly! - when
it occurred.

Since there absurdities lurking in Bowen's Judgement, I hereby Appeal
the Judgement of CFJ 835.

Steve is attempting to put words in my mouth that I can not and do not agree
with.  I maintain that two crimes are committed when D2 occurs; the crime of
performing D2 before D0 and the crime of performing D2 before D1.  The
remainder of Steve's argument is now irrelevant, since it is based on premises
which are invalid.  

Mir Herald, please transfer one Kudo from Steve, for his poor predictions about
what I will say, to KoJen, who, as many have noted in the past, is deserving
of more Honor.

I'll let Kelly provide eir definition for out-of-order.  Mine is simple.  If
there are n actions in the chain D_1, D_2, ..., D_n with D_1 required to be
performed first, D_2 second, etc., then an out-of-order action occurs for
i and j in 1..n where i < j and D_i happens after D_j.  Thus in the ordering
D2, D0, D1, D2 is out-of-order with respect to both D0 and D1 and under my
definition this constitutes two crimes.

i have to agree, despite having taken something of a role in the
discussion.  Swann's current proto is certainly complicated and
interesting in itself, but what value does it have?  i fear that even
if we do create all this structure, it will go largely unused and
ignored.

i've had this sort of idea before but have generally dismissed it as

It doesn't make sense to me to make all these bounded spaces thousands of
cimons in extent.  If you're going to actually use all this space, the
Cartographer's (Cartographor's?) job will be absolute hell.  On the other
hand, if you don't use all the space (or at least a significant fraction
of it), what's the point of all these interesting geometries?  Close up,
they'll either look polar or rectangular, and will be essentially
indistinguishable from infinite spaces.

How many Agora entities will you be interested in keeping track of the
location of?  Now, why would you want millions of times that number of
locations?

If you use the whole space, objects will be spread many cimons apart.
This makes simons look like very fine grades of distance.  So effectively
you've given the positions of objects with great precision.  To what
purpose?  I think that more than anything else, this would lead to an
excessive reliance on complex distance formulas and decreased interest.
Thus, I think the gradations of location should remain coarse.  

Even a go board, at 19x19, is fairly spacious for 10-20 Players.  19
players could each own 19 locations - you could develop alot in 19
locations.  Why make it thousands?  *I* wouldn't be interested in
managing thousands of locations individually.  Would you play go on a
100x100 board?  1000x1000?  Sure, this probably won't turn into anything
like go, but I expect the dynamics to be similarly complex.  Would you
expect anything less from Agora?

The judge's reasoning begins:

>            each out-of-order action.  Thus, using the Caller's example ...

Ah, so he seems to be accepting the Statement, though disagreeing with
the Caller's argument.  Therefore the judgement is:


> Judgement:      FALSE

?!??!?!

So, let me paraphrase:

  Caller:  Statement:  X  
           Argument:   ..., for example Y

  Judge:   No, no, no.  X is TRUE.  But Y is not a correct example.
           Judgement:  FALSE.


This appears to take the all-time championship for shoddily-reasoned 
judgements, in a close field.  If I were still a player, I would not 
stop with an Appeal or even de-Kudoing.

I would be protoing a Patent Title for the offender by now!        ;-D

Also, re: pranks and stuff: Coren and I have been talking, and I meant
to post this earlier:

There are two flags we can raise on the Agora servers, one which
prevents anyone from subscribing without approval, and another which
prevents any unsubscribed person from sending mail to the lists.

*I* think that we should implement the second but not the first,
although Coren rightly points out that setting both flags would make the

At the source of every error which is blamed on the computer you will
find at least two human errors, including the error of blaming it on
the computer.

Freely offering it, really.  However, if the NIC starts charging annual
fees even for non-profit organizations (i.e. .org extensions), then it
would be nice to have a larger pool of people from whom we can beg for
money.

Dreamland, yes.  But if we _did_ have a machine connected to the net,
and a domain, that would be the obvious next step.

Actually, I thought of this (duh) right after I wrote that note: don't
make them aliases, make them logins.  And give each a .forward file.
(Of course, each can have special mail processing going on, for instance
"archivist" could be subscribed to the lists, and auto-log.)

Not if we did it right.  The main effect would be that most official
activity would be centered on that machine, instead of spread out
between quincy.edu, dfw.net, teleport.com, and cc.monash.edu.au.  In
fact, if it weren't for unfortunate telnet lags, it would be neat to set
up logins for all players...  (I'm getting further and further into
dreamland here, I know. :)

I think it sounds ugly ("locust"?) , and I don't think I like this

I didn't think it was customary to allow "XY plane" to refer to a plane
not containing the Origin. 

I feel that this formuletion may restrict us too much to a 3D space.

Where did the B go?

Assume that the longitude wraps around at 360. Should the distance between
two points (say, at X=359, A=1, Y=B=100) close to each side of the "date
line" _really_ be almost 360? 

You may have meant to imply to use X=-1, but you have not provided for 
this in your later definitions of specific surfaces.

Ouch. Manhattan metric does _not_ work with polar coordinates; You can
sometimes get from one point to another faster by going via the Origin
than by following the latitude line, which means the distance should be
along the first road, not the last one (the triangle inequality, which
every metric must fulfil.) What is the distance to the Origin under this
scheme, anyhow? 

Unless you are on a rectangle, Euclidian distance is nicer.

BTW, it occurs to me that the Cartographor should report latitude & 
longitude rather than coordinates.

What do you measure the angle as? Degrees? Radians? (None of which are

It's a cylinder internally then, except for the Origin, where all h**l 
breaks loose.

Actually, a Manhattan metric might work, provided a circumference is no 
longer than two diameters. (Bye bye, pi, we'll never miss you :-)

As above, the angles are not clearly defined; and here too, watch out for 
distances via the Poles.

No, it is not. Are the angles both centered at the Locus? One of them
shouldn't be.

As above, the units of the angles are not defined. Otherwise, the 
Manhattan Metric seems to work for a torus.

For the others, I can't stand it.

Ok, here I have a question: Why not 6 Agorads per circumference?  Before
everyone jumps on my case, this isn't completely arbitrary.  In RL,
there are 2*pi ~= 6.28 radians per circumference.  This is so that in a
circle of radius 1, an arc of 1 radian is exactly the same length as the
radius.  Well, 6 is _close_, and has the advantage of being an
integer... and we aren't really striving for a strictly Real system.
(*groan*) (Or even for the intelligibility of the Indiana State Code! :)
Alternatively, some multiple of this, such as 600 or 6000.

Why do you need this?  Who says it has to be in any plane at all?  It's
_its own manifold_, it has no relation to X, Y, or Z planes as we know
them.

Try:
      Locations within the Agoradisk can be specified by exactly one
      pair of coordinates.  The reference on the Agoradisk is a single
      line beginning at the origin, and extending to infinity.  The
      first coordinate is the location's longitude, which is the
      location's distance from the Origin (measured in cimons).  The
      second coordinate is the location's latitude, which is the angle
      between the reference and a line from the location to the Origin,
      measured clockwise from the reference, in agorads.  The range of
      values for the first coordinate is from 0 to infinity, and the 
      range for the second is [0, 1000); 0 is a legal value, 1000 is not.

Unfortunately, it is slightly longer, but has a couple of advantages: it
is not bound to any type of space, and it has a unique coordinate
system.  Also, the coordinates are now in the correct order, and the
"latitude" and "longitude" are properly named.

Well, this isn't really a Euclidean disk--it's more like a Euclidean
cylinder, except that one end of the cylinder is collapsed to a single
point.  IOW, it has no exact Euclidean equivalent, but that's not a
problem.

"The references of the Agorasphere are the North Pole and the South
Pole, which are diametrically opposed points; the G-line, which connects
the Poles, and the Equator, the great circle which perpendicularly
bisects the G-line."

(G-line is so named because of the RL Greenwich line.)

"All locations upon the Agorasphere can be specified by exactly one pair
of coordinates.  The first is the latitude, which is measured by
calculating a plane parallel to the Equator, and passing through the
location.  The latitude is the angular measure along the G-line
(starting with 0 at the North Pole) where the plane intersects the
G-line.  The second is longitude, which is measured by calculating the
plane which intersects both poles and the location.  The longitude is
the angular measure along the equator (measured clockwise with 0 at the
G-line) where the plane intersects the Equator.  The range of values for
latitude is [0, 500), and the range for longitude is [0, 1000)."

Somewhat similar to #1, this is a little like a cylinder except _both_
ends are single points.  Non-Euclidean, but no biggie.

First of all, it is a 2D torus you describe.  Only the embedding in
Euclidean space is 3D.  (Actually, come to think of it, the same is true
for #1 and #2.)  Get rid of all the embedding language, and just put
"The Agorus is the surface of a 2D torus centered on the Locus.
Entities within....".  And I believe you mean "Origin", not "Locus", in
the last sentence?

This is tricky stuff to implement in a toroidal manifold (i.e. "top" and
"bottom" have no meaning in a torus).  But I really don't think it's all
needed?  "The references for the Agorus are two perpendicular lines, the
Major Equator and the Minor Equator."  Actually, if you like, you could
even call them X and Y axes.  As for the word "line", well, I don't
think that's the right term, but I don't know the right one.  Kelly
probably does, or Orjan.  Oh, and add "The Equators are orientable, and
have a positive and a negative direction."

The Origin is at the intersection of the Equators.

"All locations upon the Agor*us* can be specified by exactly one pair of
coordinates.  The first coordinate is the location's latitude, which is
the distance of the location from the Minor Equator, in the positive
direction of the Major Equator.  The second is the location's longitude,
which is the distance of the location from the Major Equator, in the
positive direction of the Minor Equator.  Each is measured in cimons,
and the range of values for each is [0, 1000)."

Actually, this is by far the simplest of the proposed designs.  If you
eliminate the "Equator" and "longitude" and "latitude" stuff (which I
only wrote in to parallel the other two options), it would be even
simpler.  Also, this one has a nice, even area: 1 square kilocimon, or 1
million square cimons.

Incidentally, if you are really keen on the idea, we can always embed
this later, once you come up with something to relate it to.

Well, setting the second is OK, setting the first is only OK if 
approvals take no longer than,  say, 3 days.

Well, to get practical : I have at my disposal a virtual domain and 
a few Megs of space. If the Agora community, or some benefactor, 
can raise $5 a month I can even set aside 20 Megs just for Agora. If we 
want a domain it will cost $100 for the first three years (damn the 
Nic to hell). I can set up Majordomo, scripts, mail aliases (but not user 
logins). Surely we can already do a lot with this...

At least on the frc list, which is also Majordomo, there is a flag like
the first you describe which only affects persons sending the subscription
from an address different from the one they wish to subscribe. I have it
turned on, but it is rarely triggered by ordinary subscriptions. I don't 
have the second flag you describe set, I think.
(There is probably one which works exactly like the first one you describe, 
too.)

I sent this question to Coren a few weeks ago, but have not
yet received a response...

I was looking through the old Agora Digests, and I noticed the
announcement that Coren had set size limits on the lists:
250,000 characters for nomic-official, and 50,000 for n-b and
n-d.

Does anyone know if these are still in effect?  I ask because
the Ruleset is already ~240,000 characters, and will probably
pass 250,000 in the next few months.

Please cc: any responses directly to me, as I am still unsubscribed to
n-d.

Who wants to contribute to the $50 setup fee and the $200 Internic fee
for the first two years? If we can raise that, and obtain a sponser for
about $15 a month, we can get the forwarding and the mailing lists up
and running, and it won't be UUCP either; it will be full time lines.
Not dedicated ones, but even shared a few hundred ways, a T1 goes a long
ways.

Actually, after a bit of research, we might be able to do it now. Let us
give it a shot. Unfortunately, it will be a bit behind unless we get
current information from Officers and/or the Registrar. It will take an
extra couple minutes, probably, but not more than 5. If things go
according to plan, of course. 


Enjoy!

OK - now we have to do two other things: get teleport to implement
password approval (which probably also means transferring list ownership
from Coren to Vanyel), and examining the logs to determine who has been
sending these prank subscriptions. Coren as the current list owner might
be in the best position to do this. Coren?

        "WHat seems unclear to you in Rule 869? Is it uncertainty      
        about how to send to the Public Forum?"
     
     
     No, I had no problem finding the address to the Public Forum.  
     What I did find unclear was the following part of Rule 869:
     
     "Registration occurs when a person who is not a Player sends a 
     message to the Public Forum requesting to be Registered."
     
     I interpreted this sentence to say that, since I was requesting 
     to be registered, someone (or something) would accept or reject 
     my request.  I think the following would be more clear:
     
     "Registration occurs when a person who is not a Player sends a 
     message to the Public Forum stating that Player's intent to be 
     Registered."

I have significantly lower prices from my own presence provider, $38

Going On Strike

Create a Rule with the following text (Going On Strike)

   There exists a Strike whenever three or more Players send an 
   identical message to the Speaker mentioning the fact that these 
   Players are going On Strike and the name of every Player who is 
   doing so.  Such a message must also describe an Intolerable 
   Situation, defined as a condition or set of conditions that are 
   TRUE of the Game State at the time the message is sent.

   At any time that a Strike exists, additional Players may go On 
   Strike by sending a message to the Public Forum to that effect.

   Players who are On Strike may not take any action other than to 
   announce that they are going Off Strike, and are absolved from any 
   Duty that is required of them by the Rules. No Salaries, Bonuses
   or Awards are transferred to any Player who is On Strike, with 
   the exception of Blots.

   At the end of any full Nomic Week in which a Strike exists, all 
   Active Players except the Speaker and the CotC gain 1 Blot, which 
   gain is reported by the Speaker.

   If a CFJ to the effect that the Intolerabe Situation was not
   TRUE at the time the message is sent, or that there is no Move 
   or set of Moves that can be made such that the Intolerable 
   Situation becomes FALSE, the Strike ceases to exist and all 
   Players go Off Strike.

   Players who are On Strike are ineligible from Judging such a CJF.

   If at any time there are less that two Players On Strike, or the 
   Intolerable Situtation becomes FALSE, the Strike ceases to exist
   and all Players go Off Strike.

   The Speaker and CotC may not go On Strike.

   This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would result in 
   this Rule not having effect.

Often, I think, though brown sugar probably didn't enter into it. 
(Sugar _water_, now, that's something else again).

We often have posts with a long rant ending with a Kudo transfer, for 
instance, or even one Proposal of mine that was forgotten because I'd 
put it in a message with other business in it.

OTOH, Officers should be subjected to that kind of test from time to 
time, to keep them on their toes. :)

Shorten Voting Period

Amend Rule 693 by replacing the words 'ten days' with 'one week'.
---

Comments: the Week seems to be the basic unit of Agora business,
and the one we're most comfortable with. Shortening the Voting
Period conforms with this Custom, and Players will no be less 
deterred from Proposing significant reforms one Rule at a time 
instead of in large chunks of Rule Changes.

If we are going to have property, why not make it real property?
I'd rather wrangle over Afghanistan or Fiji then (0,3,4) or
(-4,i,pi). This would also be administratively useful when
Agora takes over the world.

Note: I've now resubcribed to n-d, although I'll probably come
to regret it... :)

I guess what I was really trying to say in my earlier post
is that the distance function should describe a surface
which is at least *topologically* equivalent to what we
claim the surface actually is.  Swann's distance function works
fine for a plane with orthoganal axes, but not for a disk (at least
with longitude and latitude as he defines it) or for a sphere or
torus.  Using Swann's distance function, the "disk" has discontinuities
at the origin and along the Greenwich Meridian; the "sphere" has
discontinuities at both poles and along the Greenwich Meridian,
and the "torus" has discontinuities along the equator and
Greenwich Meridian.

To me it seems like it is doing things backwards to define the
distance function first and then choose which surface we want;
it makes more sense to me to choose first which sort of surface
we want and how to define latitude and longitude, and only then
to choose an appropriate distance function.

Hah!  :)  But why not just call it a Cylce?  (Abbreviation Cy?)

BTW, why say you're using SI units?  These units are unique to Agora, and
Agora apparently does not use other SI units, except possibly the second.

Hmm.  I wonder if it might not be better to specify some subset of
Entities which exist at locations in Agoraspace.  Call them Physical
Entities.  Only those Entities specified by the Rules to be Physical
Entities are such, and occupy locations in Agoraspace.  I suggest this
because there is such ongoing discussion about what are Entities.  (If
a player's On Hold status is an Entity, does it have a location?  Why?
Could I steal it?  :] )

Since you went to the effort above to define units, you should use them
here.  There's no sense defining a unit of distance if it never appears in
a distance formula!

I don't see how this connects with the later 'Options for the "Surface" of
Agora'.  Is it a separate option?

I still think that distances should be derived, rather than legislated.
For instance, suppose in a 1-dimensional toroidal space of length 100Ci,
I am at (95) and have 10 Movement Units to spend during the week, meaning
I can travel a distance of up to 10Ci.  If distance is _defined_ to be
|X-A|, then I can't make use of the toroidal wrap-around to go to (5),
because that would be (by definition) a distance of |5-95| = 90.  You
could, of course, define the mathematics in such a way that this problem
is eliminated.  But what happens when a new space is legislated that
connects to this one, such as a 10Ci shortcut loop between (25) and (75)?
Formulas will get very ugly very fast.  So just define some kind of step
size (surely, space will be quantized) and define the distance as the
smallest number of steps from one location to another.  Then you don't
have to rework complex distance legislation every time the space gets
changed.

It certainly _felt_ like a 3-dimensional description to me.  It could
just be me.

I think I would have tried just to describe the coordinates and their
properties.  I suppose it makes a difference whether you're trying to
closely model real distances on real spherical surfaces, etc.

It is, but the wording seems quite complex to me.  Again, I would start
with the coordinates (latitude and longitude).  Then, I'd specify their
toroidal properties, and define the Equator and Greenwich Meridian from
them only if I felt really energetic.  (Eg, the GM is the set of locations
for which Longitude = 0.)  But such complexities seem quite unnecessary.

Actually, a paradox is a proposition whose truth implies its falsity,
and vice versa. Which is not quite what I said in the post (in a part
you didn't quote). There's a distinction between a paradox and
contradiction. Neither of them amount merely to being 'counter to
accepted opinion'.

Creating a new class is actually easier than trying to make them fit
into the current Referenda Rules. The Referenda Rules add a lot of
excess baggage which would have to be explicitly trimmed in the Petition
Rules; the things remaining are fewer than the things which would be
removed from the default Refrenda Rules. It doesn't make sense to
specify X things to change than to specify one third of X things which
will actually be true. 

Besides, although it may or may not happen, and although we are not
going to push for it, encourage it, or really attempt to cause it to
happen in any way, we still wouldn't be surprised to see Referenda
phased out with the existance of Petitions and self-Promoted and
Assessed Proposals. Their usefulness in that environment would seem to
be diminished. 


Enjoy!

First, what provider? And what kind of connection do they have? And what
kind of mailing-list type software do they have? The advantage to
Teleport is that they have a T1 (possibly improving soon) connection
with free Web space, ftp space available, 5 megs of online storage
(which can be increased) , and they're still quite reasonable on price. 
Oh, and it seems there are two or three of us Players who are on Teleport 
at the moment... <grin> 

As far as the Internic fee, it was increased recently, but our bill
should be here any time now, so we'll let you know first hand soon. 
At any rate, we're not so sure it's all that realistic unless we get a
corporate sponsor. Anyone know some rich legal or college organization
that could throw us money? They could provide other sorts of hardware
support, too...

You are correct in this. A correction will appear shortly.

We seem to remember a number of CFJ's embedded in a rather long
commentary on the Rules recently. Perhaps it wasn't a treatise on brown
sugar, but we only read the first one third of the first of three parts
before we went on with things we did have time for. We're just glad e

Here is a suite of Protos which is probably going to elicit LOTS of
comments. They're welcome, but try to keep them on the subject of how to
make the process better, not whether the process should be done or not.
At this point, it's a purely theoretical exercise; the decision about
whether or not to implement it will be made at some future date,
probably around Revision 15.0 or something... <grin> 


PROTO-PROPOSAL SUITE 
Self-Promoting/Assessing Proposals

-----
PROTO-PROPOSAL
Making and Distributing Proposals, Type II, Phase 1 

Amend Rule 1036 to read:

     Let there be an Officer called the Promotor. The Promotor shall
     receive a Weekly salary of 2 Points. A Proposal by a Player shall
     be made by sending it to the Promotor. As soon as possible after
     receiving the Proposal, the Promotor shall assign the Proposal a
     Number and notify the Player who submitted that Proposal of said
     Number. 

     Within seven days of receiving the Number of the Proposal, and
     prior to the posting of any Proposals subsequently submitted by
     that Player, the Player may post the Proposal to the Public 
     Forum, along with its Number and any comments the Player wishes to
     make. If the Player does not post the Proposal within seven days,
     or out of order, then that Proposal shall cease to be a valid
     Proposal and shall not be Voted upon or Adopted. 

[Phase 1 of the transferance is sort of a trial period without doing any
major surgery on the Rule Set, thus submissions to the Promotor are
still required to mesh with Rules 1061, 109, 659 and 1065. When those
Rules have been successfully Amended, then this can be further Amended
to Phase 2 and eliminate the Promotor entirely.] 

[The time limit and ordering requirement still remains because we can
see ways to abuse the system without such requirements, and it does not
seem to be too onerous. If the Player misses the "deadline", e has to
get a new Number and do it again.]

PROTO-PROPOSAL
New Assessor Salary

As the duties of the Assessor would be much less taxing, Amend Rule 1449
to replace the phrase:

     The Assessor has a weekly salary of 8 Points.

with: 

     The Assessor has a weekly salary of 3 Points.

PROTO-PROPOSAL
Update Electioneering Rule

As the Assessor is no longer the one with confidential information, and
just to put the Rule straight with regards to any other Officer in the
future which might, Amend Rule 452 to read: 

     If any Player uses any knowledge of the current status of the Vote
     on a Proposal which e would not have known except for some official
     status, action, or recordkeeping in any attempt to influence the
     result of the Vote on that or any other Proposal, that Player shall
     be Guilty of a Class C Crime for each Proposal which e attempted to
     influence. 

     This Rule shall not apply to the posting of which Players have or
     have not Voted on a particular Proposal to tbe Public Forum. 

[General wording update which may be worth Proposing whether or not the
rest of the Suite is accepted. It still does everything the old Rule
does, but it also applies to other Officers and other Players who may be
dealing with confidential information, including Players Assessing their
own Proposals.] 


History:
11/24: Proto 0.0

PROTO-PROPOSAL
Legal Votes, Type II, Phase 1

Amend Rule 683 to read:

{Rule Needs Work; Postponed for more Protos} 

-----
PROTO-PROPOSAL
End of the Voting Period, Type II, Phase 1 

Amend Rule 208 to read:

     As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period on a given
     Proposal, the Player who Proposed that Proposal shall send all
     Votes which were legally cast to the Assessor. As soon as possible
     after receiving those Votes, the Assessor shall post them to the
     Public Forum. 

[This will fit in with Rules 312, 955, 376, 1443, 833, 1519, 947, 1047, 
1477, 1442, 1525, 1488, 1490, 1489, and Powers Rules. When these Rules have
been Amended, the Assessor can be eliminated from the process entirely.]

History:
11/24: Proto 0.0

This should be a Phase 1 system which should get us about halfway to
having Players do their own work. LOTS of little adjustments will need
to be made to move the actual workload, however, before Phase 2 can be
completed. Of course, if it weren't for Rule 1065, this could all be done 
fairly quickly, but so be it.] 



Enjoy!

Here is a somewhat more revised version of something we mentioned
earlier today... 


PROTO-PROPOSAL  (Wes)
Legislating custom

Amend Rule 1036 to replace the text:

     the Promotor shall distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players

with the text:

     the Promotor shall post the Proposal to the Public Forum
     accompanied by its Number, the name of the Player who Proposed the
     Proposal, and its Adoption Index


[It seems as though these requirements are not legislated anywhere at
this time.]

You may define new locations most simply by using the concepts of "known 
locations",  "betweenness" and "beyond".

> 
> -zefram

I'd like to mention again the idea of giving locations only to those
entities specified by the rules to the Physical Entities.  This would
eliminate such quandries, which could conceivably cause unanticipated
problems somewhere down the road.

I would also suggest limiting the positions of entities in a way less
dependent upon the specification of any particular subspace of the
Agoraverse.  Come to think of it, why even define the Agoraverse at all?
Instead, what about something like this:

(Location and Agoraspace)

	Agoraspace consists of all Locations defined by the Rules.

	No Location exists which is not defined by the Rules to be a
	Location.  All Locations defined by the Rules are distinct,
	except as specified otherwise by the Rules.

	There is a Location called the Origin.

{ Note:	This makes it very easy to add new sections to Agoraspace.
	Just define new Locations, and how they connect to (see below)
	or overlap with the previously-defined Locations.  No going
	back to modify old rules necessary. }

(Physical Entities and Position)

	Only those Entities specified by the Rules to be Physical
	Entities are Physical Entities.

	Every Physical Entity, and nothing which is not a Physical
	Entity, exists at a Location in Agoraspace.  This Location is
	the Position of the Physical Entity.  (Things which are not
	Physical Entities may still exist in the abstract, but do not
	have a Position in Agoraspace.)

	Any Physical Entity whose Position is not otherwise determined,
	explicitly or implicitly by the Rules, exists at the Origin.

	The Position of a Physical Entity may only change as specified
	by the Rules.

	[List some Physical Entities here: Players, Marks, The Nomic
	Potato, etc.]

{ Note:	No worries about unexpected Entities implicitly being located at
	the Origin, since only specified PEs exist in space.  These will
	be easier to keep track of and take into account in legislation
	about Agoraspace. }

(Adjacency, Path, and Distance: the Quantization of Space)

	Locations are only Adjacent if they are specified the the Rules
	to be Adjacent.  If a Location X is Adjacent to a Location Y,
	then Y is Adjacent to X, and X and Y are Adjacent.  (This
	defines two uses of "Adjacent".)

	A Path is a sequence of Locations, each of which is adjacent to
	the next, if any.  (There is, of course, no location next after
	the last in the sequence.)  A Path from A to B is a Path which
	has as A as its first element, and B as its final element.  The
	Length of a Path (also called the Distance along a Path) is the
	number of elements in the Path's sequence, minus 1.

	The Distance between two Locations A and B (also called the
	Distance from A to B) is defined to be the Length of the shortest
	Path from A to B.

{ Note:	I've taken here an explicitly lattice-like approach to space
	and its quantization.  All distances are integers, and space is
	not infinitely sub-dividable.  I rather like this approach
	because (1) it produces a simple space, with simple measure and
	easily described paths, (2) it permits rather simple descriptions
	of sub-spaces (see below), (3) you never again have to give a
	definition of distances between points, (4) it is possible to
	directly discuss connections between points, who owns them, and
	all kinds of other fun possibilities, and (5) there's no mucking
	around with unimportant small fractions of unit distance. }

(Agorus)

	The Agorus is a subspace of Agoraspace consisting of certain
	Locations which can be uniquely specified by T(x,y), where x
	and y are integer co-ordinates of the Location.  For any
	integers x and y, T(x,y) is a location with the following
	properties:

		T(x,y) is identical to both T(x+40,y) and T(x,y+20);
		T(x,y) is adjacent to both T(x+1,y) and T(x,y+1).

	T(0,0) is identical to the Origin.

{ Note:	Wasn't that simple? :) }

I don't want to have to do this. I would feel as ridiculous legislating
for the passage of time as I would legislating for the value of pi -
even if the legislation specified the correct value! (Or the first
thousand digits of the decimal expansion of it, or even just an
algorithm for computing it.)

No, despite the perplexities it introduces, I think we have to admit that
some events can occur despite not being required to occur by the Rules.
I suppose an example would be: the beginning of each new Nomic Week.

Related question: are all the events directly caused by moves are
required to occur by the Rules? Even though the move itself might not
be required by the Rules? Eg: the move of voluntarily making a Marks
transfer is permitted but not required, but the event of the Marks
moving from one Treasury to another is required by the Rules. But
now: what about the move of changing one's email address? This causes
the event of one's email address changing.  Is that event required to
occur? If so, what Rule requires it?

Retracted, or never happen at all.

I just want to mention that a Norwegian county a couple years ago made an
ordinance to have nice summer weather. I believe this ordinance was obeyed.

Most of the dates would seem to indicate these were sent after the close
of the VPs for the Proposals 2031-2039. One of the dates however is
01 Dec 95 17:40:09 EST - within the VPs of the Proposals.

Actually, R683 is pretty clear: I have to receive the vote within the
VP, so these votes don't count (sorry Marc). But I'm still interested
to hear any theories about how this message's headers got to look the
way do.

My personal aesthetic judgements tend to favor concepts broken into
simple modular rules that a) do one thing at a time (for the most part)
and b) use language as simply as possible.  I hade some of the twisted
sentance structure that gets into our Rules. (I've been as guilty of this as
anyone else, espcially when I use an old Rule as a template.)

Some of my favorite Rules, form-wise: 404, 321, 1021, 114.

Some of my least favorite Rules, form-wise: 1434 & 1445, 1472, 786.

I like 1020, myself. It's just about perfect. :)

One of the worst Rules is certainly 1274, with its mathematical 
confusion and unnecessary use of symbols.

Your own 1538 is a fine example of a 'diamond in the rough' : 
interesting concept, but extremely bad form (especially as regards 
grammar).

I think I see what Kelly is saying.  Suppose I have 9 Marks, and
Steve transfers 1 Mark to me.  I then transfer 1 Mark to you.
Is the Mark I transfered to you the same one that Steve transfered
to me, or is it one of the other nine?  That question cannot
be answered (by the current Rules), so Marks do not have an
individual existence.

I don't know if you're aware of it, but the single raised eyebrow is

Well, I'm glad to have two Proposals of mine passed... But I'd like 
to ask for comments regarding your votes on the others.

> 2020  [4]  Morendil   Game States                              FAILS   3-12 (4)

Well, okay. This was probably premature, given that we're trying to 
decide what Moves, Entities, Properties and Events *are*, let alone 
defining Game States formally.

> 2021       Morendil   The Conciliator                          FAILS   2-13 (4)

I'd though this had more support. Why all the opposition ? Is it that 
most people here think it's unnecessary, or because of specific flaws 
in the Proposal ?

> 2022       Morendil   The Law is Public                        FAILS   7-7  (5)

I'll probably try to get this passed again soon, since it failed by 
so little. Would be nice to get some feedback from the opposition. I 
understand Threat voting AGAINST, but how about Zefram or Oerjan ? 
What do you think is wrong with it ?

> 2023       Morendil   Limit Ruleset inflation                  FAILS   7-8  (4)

Same comments as for 2022. What improvements could it stand ?

> 2025  [3]  Morendil   Proposal Codes                           FAILS   3-11 (5)

Surprised at how little support this got. I thought we were all 
agreed that Proposal Numbering could be improved.

I have no idea where that mail got to between last week and now. Some 
relay site must have been experimenting with the 'timewarp' 
command... H. Herald, please disregard the above if you've already 
taken my previous message requesting same into account.

I've watched the Agora Nomic list for a while; it seems you are having great
difficulty progressing on a definition of entity.  Why not resort to a simple
enumeration?

Anything not explicitly declared by the Rules to be an Entity is not an Entity.
Agora World is an Entity.
All Players are Entities.
All Points are Entities.
All Marks are Entities.
All Official Documents are Entities.

Just for clarification, you could list:
No Rules are Entities except via their inclusion in an Official Document.
No Salaries are Entities; however, the Points which result thereof are
Entities.

As far as I can find, no Rule whatsoever requires me as Ambassador to 
comply with any Foreign Policy Directive if I do not wish to do so.

Does anyone agree or disagree ? Not that I don't intend to carry out 
'Recognize Canada', but it seems strange to me that there exists an 
Office the sole obligations of which are to report Directives the 
Officer is not required to follow. :)

Quite right. I'm sure that the Rules for Barring Players from Judging 
a CFJ have a lot to do with that, too... Influencing the selection of 
the Judge in this way has obviously been a profitable tactic in past
CFJs.

To date, here are the specific aspects of our hypothetical Code of 
Evidence, to my recollection, that have been brought up :

* timing of Moves
(what determines when a Move was made and when the resulting Event 
takes place ? A "Date:" header, and if so, which one ? What about my 
Kudo transfers that were sent last week and got to the lists only 
yesterday ?)

* burden of proof
(If an Officer claims not to have received a Move a Player claims to 
have sent, or the reverse, who has to present proof ? What 
constitutes proof ?)

* formalism of arguments
(Many Judgements have been appealed on the grounds of arguments being
'absurd', sometimes justifiably... Do we need to have a 'proper form' 
for presenting arguments & reasonings ?)

Also, there is the more general problem of how we use this Code. Is 
there a Rule that makes Judgements illegal if they don't conform ? 
Can that Rule result in CFJs itself ? Who decides whether a Judgement 
conforms to the Code ?

I greatly admire the underlying intent of 2045, but as a TIA

I expect this was all gone over while I was On Hold, but mightn't
this accidentally expand the scope of TIA considerably?  I mean,
if all Agorans happened to be subscribed to MUFFINS-L, but the
Distributor didn't happen to notice this and explicitly declare
MUFFINS-L a non-PF, then any posting to MUFFINS-L would be "equivalent
to sending a message to the Public Forum", and therefore presumably
subject to TIA?  Which seems like an undesirable result?

Is there any particular reason to avoid labeling requirements?
I think it might more directly accomplish the goal if posting
to the PF were declared to be accomplished by either of:

  - Posting to the Distributor-defined PF, or
  - Sending a message in such a way that it reaches all
    Players, *and* clearly labelling the message as being
    a posting to the Agora Public Forum.

This would avoid accidental PF-postings, while still avoiding
insane distributors...

I've looked everywhere for a Canadian hierarchy of newsgroups,
but the closest I can find to a wide-audience newsgroup specifically 
related to Canada is soc.cultuire.canada.

This would probably do as a channel for presenting Agora's Formal 
Greetings, though. Is anyone aware of a better way ?

So you are saying that a dollar is not an entity? It falls into the same

BTW, we just spotted a few things that put this argument to rest. 

"A Currency is a type of Nomic Entity" [Rule 1467/1]

"Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules... (such as Points,
Votes, Currencies and any Official Records)" [Rule 1011/0] 

"Offices are a class of Nomic Entities" [Rule 1006/4] 

In addition, Kudos, Patent Titles, Theses, the Potato, the Mint, 
and Indices are explicitly defined to be Entities, and Players and
Groups are indirectly defined to be Entities through their definition as
a Voting Entity. 

It would seem that Game Custom would bring a lot of weight into the
definition of an Entity. 


Enjoy!

A piece of paper is an Entity, right? It is obviously a piece of paper,
and has an individual existance. It's right here. Now I tear the piece
of paper in half. Wow. Now there are two pieces of paper. Both would be
Entities, right? Now let's say I tape those pieces of paper back
togther, so it's one piece of paper again. It's still an Entity. Why
wouldn't it be? 

How is this different than the divisibility of Marks or Points?

OK, I've dug this up and had a closer look at it. I think the idea is
good, but I think the proto still needs some fine tuning. Some of the
language used is a bit loose, inaccurate or awkward.

Remove the leading quote. "A Proposal containing a VOC Directive has
[better than 'must have'] an Adoption Index of 2, or greater than 2
if another Rule requires it. This Rule takes precedence over any
Rule requiring a lower AI for such a Proposal." [Precedence relations
have as their relata Rules, not bits of Rules.]

"Each Document must fit the following criteria at the commencement of
the Voting Period of the Proposal containing the VOC Directive:"
[Simplifies what follows, since 3 of the 5 conditions have this
qualification. Also, you need to treat the Documents individually, 
and say what happens if a Document referred to in a VOC does not
meet the criteria. See below.]

This may need to be tailored to fit with Kelly's Judicial Reform package.
Also, I'd say "...currently the subject of a CFJ...", but that's just
a quibble.

Simpler just to say: "The information within the Document has not been
superceded by the subsequent publication of another Document." [Note
the switch to the singular.]

At this point, you must specify what happens if a Document in a VOC
fails to meet the criteria. You have two choices: invalidate the
entire VOC, including the effects of other Documents which do meet
the criteria, or just invalidate the VOC in that Document. Obviously
the latter is preferable. It's probably a good idea to introduce 
another definition at the top of the proto defining validity and
invalidity of VOCs.

Don't capitalize 'time'. Yecch! It's probably more accurate to refer
to the time the Document was first published in the Public Forum,
rather than just the "time they were produced", which is not as clear.
Still, this is the heart of the proto - and it's pretty good.

I'm astonished that a man as mad keen as you are about Rampant
Capitalization, hasn't capitalized 'Voting Period'. Also, "published 
in the Public Forum" is more accurate than "issued". Which reminds
me, we really should adopt a Rule defining "publication" as "publication
in the Public Forum".

This is a little unclear. What if the Claim is still unsettled when
the VOC is adopted? Naturally, I'd also prefer it if you didn't
preempt my use of the word 'Error', and I absolutely insist that
you don't capitalize it, since it isn't defined anywhere else in the
Rules.

>      If, during the VOC Directive's Voting period, a COE is issued on a
>      Document within it, *and* the COE is admitted before passage, then

"passage...has no effect" [Clearer than "will have".] Also, "Voting
Period".

"This Rule takes precedence..." [See remarks above.]

"to that reported in Official Documents."

Still needs work, but the idea is good.

Here I go again. I'd like to know of anyone formally opposes this, 
and if so, what eir reasons are.


Proto-Proposal
---
Shorten Voting Period

Amend Rule 693 by replacing the words 'ten days' with 'one week'.
---

Comments: the Week seems to be the basic unit of Agora business,
and the one we're most comfortable with. Shortening the Voting
Period conforms with this Custom, and Players will no be less 
deterred from Proposing significant reforms one Rule at a time 
instead of in large chunks of Rule Changes.

I wish to request the Agorans' opinion of this. Is anyone very likely 
to vote AGAINST ?

Proto-Proposal
---
Short Rule Incentive

Create a rule with this text (Short Rule Incentive) :

   Any individual proposed Rule Change, with the exception of a
   Repeal, which as part or all of its effect, causes the affected 
   Medium or Long Rule to become Short, will cause the Player
   who proposed it to be awarded a bonus of two Points.

   Any individual proposed Rule Change which, as part or all of its
   effect, causes the affected Short or Medium Rule to become Long,
   will cause the Player who proposed it to be subject to a penalty
   of two Marks.

   The Rulekeepor is responsible for reporting these transfers as
   soon as possible after the Assessor reports the adoption of a
   Proposal containing such Rule Changes, and for determining the 
   Length of a Rule.

   The Rulekeepor shall report whenever e publishes the Ruleset what 
   criteria are used to determine the Length of a Rule. These criteria
   apply to all Rules and must be based only on the formatting of the 
   Rules. They can be changed only through the adoption of a 
   Directive to that effect.

Directive :

   The Rulekeepor is directed to report that a Short Rule is one
   under 10 lines in length when formatted to 70-column format,
   including a 6-space indent; that a Long Rule is one over 30 lines
   in length in that format; and that all other Rules are Medium.
---

Revision history :

1 - Oct. 30, original proto
2 - Oct. 31
No longer applies to all Rules, but only the changed Rule.
Specifies when the transfer takes effect.
3 - Nov. 5
Clears up how length is measured.
Repeals no longer count as 'short rules'.
4 - Dec. 5
Transferred responsibility for measuring and reporting to the 
Rulekeepor, to avoid problems with the manner of measuring
Rules.
No longer awards bonuses for amendments that don't change a
Rule's length.
Revised the relative importance of bonus/penalty.
5 - Dec. 5
Introduced Short, Medium and Long as 'variable' measurements for 
Rules. This way, the Ruleset format may still change after this is 
adopted.
6 - Dec. 6
The Formatting Directive now reflects Rulekeepor's Chuck format.

Can the Ambassador report what steps, if any, have been taken in the
direction of actually identifying the offender? It is my understanding
that an examination of teleport's logs for the periods of the separate
incidents should reveal who sent the messages containing the rogue
subscriptions, unless the culprit was particularly clever. We should
at least try. Also, there was some brief discussion about setting
various flags on our lists. Has this been done?

Proto-Proposal
(WAS : The Mutant)
---
Genetics (1 Creation, 1 Directive, 1 Repeal)

Create a Rule with this text (Genetics):

   There is a Rule known as The Mutant, and an integer known as
   the Number of the Beast. The Number of the Beast is determined
   by a Directive, and uniquely identifies The Mutant. If at any time 
   there is no Number of the Beast associated with an existing Rule, 
   this Rule has no effect.

   As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the 
   Rulekeepor shall select three random numbers :
    - P between 1 and 1000
    - N between 1 and 500
    - E between 1 and 100
   and an English language dictionary of eir choice. For the 
   purposes of this Rule, only those pages numbered with arabic
   numerals and containing dictionary entries are to be used.

   The Mutant shall then be modified in the manner of a non-Proposed
   Amendment by replacing the Nth word of The Mutant with the word
   corresponding to the Eth entry of page P of the selected dictionary,
   if and only if :
     - The Mutant contains N words or less;
     - the dictionary contains P pages or less
     - page P contains E entries or less;
     - the replacement does not result in a sentence that is 
       ungrammatical after properly conforming the replacement
       word to the grammatical attributes (tense, person, gender,
       number) of the word it replaces.

   The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of this process as soon 
   as possible after the beginning of any Nomic Week, but no sooner 
   than e actually applies it.

Directive : set the Number of the Beast to 1061.

Rule 1454 is Repealed.    
---

Comments : it should be much more interesting to see how a Rule 
Mutates than to simply Repeal it. This can be used as torture for 
Rules we dislike particularly. :)

Revision history :

1- 15 Nov., original proto
2 - 1 Dec., added Repeal of the Virus
3 - 6 Dec., Minor fixes, spelcheking
4 - 12 Dec.
Changed Rule Title to avoid confusion with The Mutant.
Simplified description of the selection process.
Clarified grammatical 'equivalence'.

So you admit that a piece of paper is an entity? That's an important
step. 

The next step would be to compare it all to a car. A car is an entity,
right? It exists quite nicely. See that car over there? It has definite,
individual existance. It's a car. Now pop the hood (gee, I hope it's
your car... <grin>). See that little hose down there? It exists by
itself, too, right? It's a hose. It's an entity which is part of a
larger entity, the car. 

Now let's say the hose gets a hole in it. We take it to the auto shop
and they put in a new hose. The car is still an entity, and for all
intents and purposes it is the same entity. Yes, it is technically
slightly different. It has a new hose. It's a car with a new hose
instead of a car with an old hose. But would you go to your friends and
say "I have a new car!"?? Of course not. You don't have a new car, just
the old car with a new hose. It's still the same entity: the old car. 

Now even if you broke down that car into component parts and spread it
all over the place; hell, even if you sold your tires to one guy and
your engine block to someone else, if you accumulate all the parts
together again and reassemble it, it's still the same car. You might
have to go buy your engine block back from the guy you sold it to, but
if you did, you could put together your old car. 

But wait! You can't get that new hose back, so you go buy (another) new
one. Does that make this a different car? Did one hose make it a
different car before? Of course not. It's the same car, with a new hose.


Now, what would you say is wrong with this scenerio? 


Enjoy!

I would much prefer amending 993 to give all Directives a default minimum
AI of 1. I was under the mistaken(?) impression that this was already the
case. 

COE, Rulekeepor (sorry):
In particular, the above is not enough; the Category change Directives
have the same problem. It seems whoever amended them away from using AI=2
was under the same impression as I was. This means that some Category 
changes may not actually have taken place.

Greetings,

Ah, but that *doesn't* destroy the Game State!!  Consider the following:

All Players, simultaneously, cease to play, without deregistering.

Two years later, a person named Bob comes across some reference
to Agora Nomic.  Being interested, he does some digging, finds
records of Agora, and is able to determine the Game State at
the point that everyone ceased to play.

He now posts to the Public Forum that he registers as a Player.  Note
that such a message is sufficient for registration, without any
action on the part of any other Player.

Then he alleges that the Speaker has abandoned, and calls for the
Speaker to announce eir presence.  When the Speaker does not respond,
Bob becomes the Arbiter of Succession for Speaker Transfer.  Bob
is the only person to express a willingness to be Speaker, and thus
e becomes Speaker.

Bob now alleges that all other players are deregistered due to inactivity.
When the Registrar does not respond, the duty devolves to the Speaker
and Speaker Bob confirms that all Players except himself are
deregistered.  Now all offices are vacant and Bob fulfills the
duties of all officers.  Later, some of Bob's friends can join
and fill various offices.

Result: Agora Nomic continues, despite the fact that all Players
had ceased to play for two years.  In light of this, how can you
say that the Game State ceased to exist?

Ok, my finals ended a couple days ago, so I've taken advantage of the
incredible amount of free time to do a number of fun and interesting
Nomic-related things.

THE FIRST THING
The most important, probably, to everyone here, is the nomic-request
server.  Simply mail a message to me (blahedo@quincy.edu), with
"nomic-request" somewhere in the subject, and the server will process
your message.  It can serve up a number of files:
	* Proposals.  It can give _all_ the Proposals I have access
		to, not just the ones currently on the Web site.
	* CFJs.  It can serve any CFJ which I have, on the Web site or
		not.
	* Any files on the Web site.  Even if you don't have Web access,
		you can grab a file off the site.
The syntax is to type "get" as the first thing on a line (not including
whitespace), then type in all your requested files, separated by spaces.
To request Proposals, give P#### as the filename; to request CFJs, give
C#### as the filename, and to request web files, you'll have to look at
the index to see how I've named them all.

The other two commands besides "get" are "help" (which basically tells
you what I'm telling you now) and "index", which lists all the files you
can get.

Please, send me comments--I just wrote this last night/today, so it
probably still has a few bugs running around.


THE SECOND THING
The Notary is online!  At "http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora/notary/", 
I have a list of all Public Organizations, and their Administrators,
Executors, and Jurisdictions.  In addition, I have a copy of their
Compact, although it may not be quite up-to-date (but it _is_
Webbified.)  Administrators, if you update your Compact, please send me
a new copy, _and_ what changes were made--I will not rewebbify the
entire document, just the changed part.


THE THIRD THING
Remember a month ago when I asked everyone for some info about
themselves?  Well, I've been gleaning info from the servers since then,
and now, for your viewing pleasure, I am proud to present
"http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/bio.html", which contains Email
addresses for every player and active watcher, and a few ex-players;
homepages for people who have them; as much info as I could drag from
the Registrar's report about these people; and of course any
biographical info they've posted recently.  Check it out.  Once you've
checked it out, if you like, elect me as Registrar--I'd be happy to do
the work.


THE FOURTH AND FINAL THING
I have updated my Web pages in various places so that they refer to
relevant Rules on Chuck's page... perhaps minor, but it might be
convenient, and it may make it easier for newbies to "grasp the
concepts".

actually, finding the median is more complicated than finding the
mean.  for the mean, you can just blindly add and divide.  for the
median, you have to sort.  well, you don't _have_ to sort; there are
algorithms to find the median of a collection without first sorting
it, but they're more complicated than they're worth.

i didn't say anything about not admitting arithmetic concepts.  i am

In the matter of the Appeal of CFJ 835, I overturn Bowen's Judgement
of FALSE and Judge the Statement TRUE.

This has been a most curious CFJ! In fact I accept something very
close, perhaps even identical, to Judge Bowen's analysis, and reject
Kelly's analysis.  Yet Judge Bowen's argument seems to me to clearly
support a finding of TRUE, while I find that Kelly's actual argument
misanalyzes R1023. A must curious state of affairs.

To sum up what follows, I shall argue that Bowen, and Kelly in her 
Statement (but not her arguments), are correct that a Crime is
committed for each out of order action. I shall argue with Bowen,
and against Kelly, that the ordering D2, D0, D1 represents 2 Crimes
and not 1. And finally, I shall argue against both Kelly and Bowen
that these Crimes are committed not when D2 is performed (as
Bowen later claimed he meant), but when D0 and D1 is performed.
I shall argue that the performance of D2 is not actually a Crime
at all!  Although this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, showing
the need for an amendment to R1023 (described below), that is what
R1023 actually says.

My analysis focuses on the ordering D2, D0, D1. It will help to have
before us once again the relevant part of R1023:

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then: 

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to 
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no later than any other 
           action which the performance of the duties of that 
           Office subsequently requires em to perform;

      Failure to observe these time requirements is a Class D Crime.


The key phrases are: "...the Player is required to perform the
action...no *later* than any other action which [e is] *subsequently*
require[d] to perform." Because of the use of the words "later" and
"subsequently", I call this the 'LS formulation'.

Now think again about the ordering D2, D0, D1. In this case, has D2
been performed *later* than any other action *subsequently* required
to be performed? No! In the first place, D2 was the *last* of the
requirements to be incurred, so there *is* no action subsequently
required to be performed which D2 has been performed later than. And
in the second place, D2 is performed *first* in the series, so there
are no other actions in the example which it can be performed later
than. In fact, the only way the performance of D2 could be a Crime is
if it were performed later than the performance of some hypothetical
D3 which it was supposed to be performed prior to. Since that
situation does not obtain in the example, the performance of D2 out
of order is not a Crime.

When, then, is the Crime committed? Look at D0. Has *it* been performed
later than some action that was subsequently required to be performed?
Yes it has! It has been performed later than D2, which we stipulated
became required to be performed after D0. So the performance of D0
is a Crime. The same goes for D1, which has also been performed later
than D2. So, in the example, 2 Crimes are committed, one when D0 is
performed, and one when D1 is performed.

But, looking back at Kelly's Statement, this is precisely what that
Statement alleges! Kelly's Statement alleges two things:

1) ...each action which a Player is obliged to perform, but fails to
perform, within the time required by this Rule is a separate and
distinct Crime, 

2) ...each action performed by a Player in an order which is
inconsistent with the requirements of this Rule is itself a Crime
separate and distinct from each other such action, and from any Crime
for failure to meet the time requirement.

About (1) there seems to be no disagreement. We've been discussing
(2). In the case of the ordering D2, D0, D1, the only actions which
are in fact inconsistent with the requirements of R1023 are D0 and D1,
and lo and behold, the performance of each of these actions is itself
a separate and distinct Crime. So Kelly's Statement is TRUE, despite
the bad argument she gave for it, and despite Bowen's Judgement of
FALSE, delivered in spite of the good argument he gave for its truth!
Bizarre.

That takes care of the Judicial matters, but more is left to do. Clearly,
the current wording of R1023, ie the LS formulation, is inadequate.
This is so because in a case like the one above, we actually *want*
there to be just one Crime, committed when D2 is performed. Otherwise,
we run into oddities, even absurdities. After D2 is performed, we already
know that an ordering Crime has been committed (or rather, will be
committed when D0 is performed), but as things stand we have to wait
until D0 is performed before we know when the Crime is committed.
This is silly. What can be done about it?

The answer will, I think, surprise. It certainly surprised me! I
propose to replace the LS formulation with what I call the EA
formulation, ie replace "later" with "earlier" and "subsequently"
with "already". That would mean R1023 would read like this:

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform;

This actually enforces exactly the same partial ordering on requirements
as before - and gives the right answer in the D2, D0, D1 case. Performance
of D2 in this scenario is now a Crime (as it should be), since it is the
performance of an action earlier than the performance of other actions
(D0 and D1), which are already required to be performed. To see that it
makes sense more generally, consider the simpler case of rerquirements to
perform actions D1 and D2, incurred in that order, but performed in the
reverse order D2, D1.

Again, I think it's clear that in this case, we ought to tie the time
of commission of the Crime to the time of commission of D2. But under
the LS formulation, it's the performance of D1 that's the Crime, since
only D1 has been performed *later* than an action *subsequently* required
to be performed. The EA formulation gets the right answer, since D2 has
been performed *earlier* than some action *already* required to be
performed.

      while i am a bit uncozy with this wording, it's a lot better
      than what we have now.  FOR.

2054:
      five, fifty, five hundred, whatever.  FOR.

2055:
      i'm a bit concerned about the changing form of the terms in this
      Rule.  first, we have that a Player who fails to comply with the
      Rules has Violated the Rules.  then we have that a Violation of
      _a_ Rule is a Rules Violation.  is this supposed to tie in with
      the first paragraph?  why the different syntax, then?  also,
      what does it mean to Violate _a_ Rule?  is this different from
      Violating _the Rules_?  sadly, AGAINST.

2056:
      why, exactly, does the Promotor have to identify the Proposer of
      each Proposal?  e only needs to pass that information along to
      the Assessor.  Promotor Vanyel experimented with anonymous
      Promotion, and i rather liked it.  i don't want to see
      nonanonymity legislated.  also, i don't care if the Promotor
      publishes the AI or not.  Proppsal Number and Proposal Text is
      enough for me.  AGAINST.

----------

BONUSES/PENALTIES:

Long Proposals - None 
Too Many Proposals - 
   Kelly loses 1 Mark for 2047 since it was submitted during the
     previous Nomic Week (last Sunday), even though it was distributed
     during this Nomic Week. 
   Vanyel loses 6 Marks for 2052, 2053, and 2054. 

Note: Everyone who submitted Proposals which have been Proto-Proposed
need to notify the *Assessor* of this fact prior to the conclusion of
the Voting Period for your Proposal. A comment attached to your Proposal
should do it, as long as you clearly mark it as intending it to be
distributed along with the Proposal. 

Also, Mr. Assessor, we Proto-Proposed both of our Proposals in this
batch. 

----------

PROPOSAL 2046  (Chuck)  -  AI 1 
Change Category of "Definition of Violations"

This Proposal contains zero proposed Rule Changes and one Directive.

I.  The Category of Rule 1538 shall be changed from "Definitions"
    to "Organizations."

[The most important part of my Proposal 1787, which narrowly failed.
Also, this is not included in Swann's Proposal 2027.  As I pointed
out before, the "Definitions" Category ought to be for *only* those
definitions which apply to many aspects of the game and do not
readily fit into any other Category (such as ASAP or Random).
The definition of Violation is not such a definition.]


[Distributed 12/9/95] 

----------

PROPOSAL 2047  (Kelly)  - AI 1
fix repeal bonuses

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 947 be amended to read:

      If there are more than 100 Rules, and a Proposal is adopted
      which, as part or all of its effect, repeals one or more Rules,
      the Player who proposed that Proposal shall receive 5 Points.
      This transfer shall be reported by the Rulekeepor, who shall do
      so as soon as possible after the Proposal's Adoption.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

the Rulekeepor seems more appropriate to detect this condition, since
e is the one who actually applies the Rule Changes to the Ruleset.

also disinfects Rule 947.

PROPOSAL 2048  (Morendil)  -  AI 1
Update 1051

Amend Rule 1051 by replacing the second paragraph with :

   The Rulekeepor shall receive a weekly Salary of 5 Points.


[the Speaker *is* no longer required to maintain or publish 
the Ruleset unless Rulekeepor is vacant; also, the Rulekeepor *is* 
constrained by the Rules defining the Logical Ruleset.]

PROPOSAL 2049  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
Fix tense in 1020

Whereas the tense of the verb in Rule 1020 is future (or declarative
mood, possibly),

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1020 be Amended by replacing the
words "shall be" with "is".

[Comment: Protoed as Green-1.  Actually, it might not be future tense,
but at the very least it seems prescriptive as opposed to descriptive,
which I think should be reversed.]

----------

PROPOSAL 2050  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
Update and clarify 101

Whereas there is some outdated bootstrapping stuff in rule 101, and

Whereas Rule 101 currently implies some sort of Platonic ideal,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 101 be Amended by deleting the
following text:

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the
      first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable)
      and 201-219 (Mutable).

----------

PROPOSAL 2051  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
Clarify Permissibility vs. Possibility

Whereas various Players have misinterpreted Rule 116 as granting
possibility to certain impossible actions,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 116 is Amended by appending the
following text:

      However, the permissibility of an Action in no way indicates the
      possibility of that Action.

[Comment: Vacuous it may be, but I think it is an important
clarification.  The voters will decide.  Protoed as Green-3.]

PROPOSAL 2052  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
The PF is your own problem

Whereas the Distributor no longer directly sends out Official
messages, and

Whereas the Distributor does not have absolute control over the
subscription lists of the Public Forum listservers,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 478 be Amended by replacing the
text

      Subscription may be necessary to be able to receive the Public
      Forum, in which case such a subscription is mandatory to all
      Players.

with

      It is the Player's responsibility to receive all media which
      comprise the Public Forum.

Be it further resolved that the word "send" be changed to "sent".

[Comment: A necessary change, I think.  Protoed as Green-5.
Incidentally, an insane distributor wouldn't matter here, because
any message to all Players is ok for PF stuff.]

----------

PROPOSAL 2053  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
Un-mathify Indices

Whereas the second paragraph of Rule 1274 is somewhat difficult to
read,

Be it therefore resolved that the second and final paragraph of Rule
1274 be Amended to read as follows:

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater is
      the greater Index.

[Comment: Protoed as Green-7.]

PROPOSAL 2054  (Vanyel)  -  AI 1
Who wants to discourage Proposals?

Whereas the current 1065 is too restrictive,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1065 be Amended by replacing "two" in
the first paragraph with "five".

[Comment: Not protoed.]

[Submitted 12/5/95]

PROPOSAL 2055  (Wes)  -  AI 1 

Amend Rule 1538 to read:  

     Any Player who fails to comply with the Rules has Violated the
     Rules. Any Player who fails to comply with a Compact while within
     that Compact's Jurisdiction has Violated that Compact. 

     Any Violation of a Rule is a Rules Violation. Any Violation of a 
     Compact which results in a Violation to the Rules is a Rules Violation. 
     Any Violation of a Compact which does not result in a Rules Violation 
     is a Civil Violation. 

Amend Rule 1529 by appending the following text to the paragraph which 
begins "i) Statutes": 

     Any Violation of a Statute is also a Violation of this Rule.

PROPOSAL 2056  (Wes)  -  AI 1
Legislating custom

Amend Rule 1036 to replace the text:

     the Promotor shall distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players

with the text:

     the Promotor shall post the Proposal to the Public Forum
     accompanied by its Number, the name of the Player who Proposed the
     Proposal, and its Adoption Index


[It seems as though these requirements are not legislated anywhere at
this time.]

Perhaps we need the concept of "Rigorously Defined Entity". A RDE may *only* be
changed as defined in Agora Rules, whereas other entities may *conceivably* be
changed by other means. For example, a Point will be a RDE, but an email
address is not.

Then, once we change Rule 1011 to define "Rigorously Defined Entity", we need
to massively amend the Rule Set to specify which Entities are Rigorously
Defined. There would be many such Entities which are Rigorous, thus many
amendments. But perhaps this must be done.

All the suggesions up to now have failed to provide an unambiguous means of
distinguishing between Entities which can change outside of the Rules and which
cannot. There may be no good way other than to explicitely define which ones
cannot.

I suppose it's mainly a metaphysical objection. The game does not
exist when it is not being played. I claim Bob is just setting up
a new game patterned on the old. Let me pose a counter-question:
what if two people independently come upon these old records, and,
unaware of each other, simultaneously engage upon the procedure you
describe. Which of the two resulting games is "really" Agora?

A good argument, but unfortunately, there is a flaw.  Since all
players must subscribe to the PF, and registrations must be posted
to the PF, the registration of whichever one registers second will
be seen by the first.

I argue that it is *not* a new game patterned on the old; if it
were, Bob could just start the game _de novo_ with the old
Game State, rather than having to go through the rigamarole of
alleging that the Speaker has abandoned, waiting for the Speaker
to respond, performing the order of succession procedure, etc. etc. etc.

This COE is admitted.  The Category changes, Title changes, and
Category creations in Proposals 1757, 1758, and 2027 were without

Correction: The Rule defining Category-name-change directives
had its AI-defining sentence deleted later than the other
Rule maintenance directives.  Thus, the Category-name-change
directives in 1757 and 1758 were effective.  (And that was the
only directive in 1757).  All other directives in 1758 and 2027
were without effect.

Proto-Proposal
(WAS : The Mutant)
---
Genetics (1 Creation, 1 Directive, 1 Repeal)

Create a Rule with this text (Genetics):

   There is a Rule known as The Mutant, and an integer known as
   the Number of the Beast. The Number of the Beast is determined
   by a Directive, and uniquely identifies The Mutant. If at any time 
   there is no Number of the Beast associated with an existing Rule, 
   this Rule has no effect.

   As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the 
   Rulekeepor shall randomly select :
    - in an English language dictionary of eir choice, one page 
      containing dictionary entries,
    - one entry on that page,
    - one word of The Mutant.

   The Mutant shall then be modified in the manner of a non-Proposed
   Amendment by replacing the selected word with the word or words
   corresponding to the selected entry of the dictionary, if and only if
   the replacement does not result in a sentence that is ungrammatical
   after properly conforming the replacement word or words to the
   grammatical attributes (tense, person, gender, number) of the
   word it replaces.

   These Rule Changes take effect upon publication by the Rulekeepor 
   of the results of this procedure, which shall take place within 24 
   hours of the procedure being applied.

Directive : set the Number of the Beast to 1061.

Rule 1454 is Repealed.    
---

Comments : it should be much more interesting to see how a Rule 
Mutates than to simply Repeal it. This can be used as torture for 
Rules we dislike particularly. :)

Revision history :

1- 15 Nov., original proto
2 - 1 Dec., added Repeal of the Virus
3 - 6 Dec., Minor fixes, spelcheking
4 - 12 Dec.
Changed Rule Title to avoid confusion with The Mutant.
Simplified description of the selection process.
Clarified grammatical 'equivalence'.
5 - 14 Dec.
Unmathified random selection.
The RS now changes only when the changes are published.

I assume this will be proposed only after 993 is fixed, or else you
need to explicitly state that such a directive has a minimum AI of 1.

Question: how should we refer to such a Rule Change?  We can't call
it "Mutation," as that's changing the MI of a Rule.

I don't particularly like this, or in general the language used
to define AIs for Proposals containing Directives.  I'd like to
see a bit more comprehensive change to such Rules--I'll write something
up.

Also, I don't see that this would be particularly effective, as
Rule 594 *already* says that the AI of *every* Proposal must be
at least 1!

ProtoProposal Chuck024/1
Clean Up Directives

This Proposal contains six proposed Rule Changes and zero Directives.

I. Rule 993 is amended to read:

      A Proposal is permitted to contain one or more Directives.  A
      Directive, if it takes effect, causes some change in the Game
      State other than Changing a Rule.  No Directive shall Change
      any Rule.

      A Directive takes effect if and only if: (i) the Proposal
      containing it is adopted; (ii) the Directive is of a type
      specifically defined by the Rules; and, (iii) the Adoption Index
      of the Proposal is at least the minimum Adoption Index necessary
      for such a Directive to take effect.

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the minimum Adoption Index
      necessary for a Directive to take effect is 1.

      If a Proposal containing Directives which take effect is
      adopted, those Directives shall take effect in the order that
      they appear in the Proposal, and according to the Rule or Rules
      which define the type of each Directive in question.

II. Rule 594 is amended by changing the second paragraph to read:

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the Adoption Index of a
      Proposal shall be the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes and Directives within the Proposal to take
      effect, or 1, whichever is greater.

III. Rule 1370 shall be amended by changing the part that currently
reads:

      To receive the Degree Associate of Nomic:
        - The Voting Index of the Proposal to Request a Degree must be
          at least 1.

      To receive the Degree Bachelor of Nomic:
        - The Voting Index of the Proposal to Request a Degree must be
          at least 1.
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.

      To receive the Degree Master of Nomic:
        - The Voting Index of the Proposal to Request a Degree must be
          at least 2.
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.

      To receive the Degree Doctor of Nomic Philosophy:
        - The Voting Index of the Proposal to Request a Degree must be
          at least 3.
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.
        - The Proposal to Request a Degree must also contain a
          creative work whose topic or theme is any concept related to
          Agora or Nomic in general.  The author of this work must be
          Person X.

To read:

      To receive the Degree Associate of Nomic:
        - (No additional requirements)

      To receive the Degree Bachelor of Nomic:
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.

      To receive the Degree Master of Nomic:
        - The minimum Adoption Index necessary for such a Directive to
          take effect is 2.
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.

      To receive the Degree Doctor of Nomic Philosophy:
        - The minimum Adoption Index necessary for such a Directive to
          take effect is 3.
        - The Thesis in the Proposal to Request a Degree must be at
          least 500 words.
        - The Proposal to Request a Degree must also contain a
          creative work whose topic or theme is any concept related to
          Agora or Nomic in general.  The author of this work must be
          Person X.

IV. Rule 1512 shall be amended by deleting the sentence, "The AI of a
Proposal which contains such a Directive shall be at least 1."

V. Rule 1044 shall be amended by deleting the sentence, "The Proposal
containing such a Directive shall have an Adoption Index of at least
1."

VI. Rule 1070 shall be amended by deleting the sentence, "A Proposal
containing a Foreign Policy Directive shall have an Adoption Index of
at least 1."

[Greatly cleans up the language dealing with Directives, bringing
them more in line with Rule Changes.  Also allows Directives which
were undefined when the Proposal was proposed, but defined when it
was assessed, to have effect.]

What if there is more than one PF? Any while were at it, how is

But Bob can. It's his choice what to do. He can set himself up as
legitimate Roman emperor for all I care--continuity exists only
if it is generally accepted. If people around the Mediterranean
accept Bob as Emperor, then he is as legitimate as any other. For an
activity like Agora, w/o RL ramifications, it's more or less an
individual decision.

Not really. After all, having a physical manifestation of form is only

And in Nomic, we have determined that all Currencies (including Marks)
are Entities. "A Currency is a type of Nomic Entity" [Rule 1467/1]. However,
regardless of the legal definition, even if you built a whole new car on
the same frame, you would tell your friends that you built a new car.
You may mention that it has the same frame, but there are very few
people who would point to the Title and say "Oh, no, that's the same car
I used to have..." when talking in a normal social situation.

To use the new Nomic terminology that seems to be forming, your
Properties change over time, but your dasein does not. We are attempting
to reference the dasein of an Entity with our definitions.

What? Go over that once again? You are rejecting the common English use
of a term and definition because it may have been formed differantly if
Real Life were more like Nomic? We're missing something here... 

We are attempting to show that a Mark can be an Entity in spite of the
fact that it can be broken into pieces by attempting to show that the
word entity can refer to a collection of similar or related items rather
than solely to the component parts which make up that set. You reject
that argument because in Nomic, things are simpler? 



Enjoy!

Does it matter? The point was to show that a component to an Entity
can be removed and/or replaced while it still remains the "same" Entity.
At some point, it would become a new Entity, but at what point that
would be is not the issue. At what point would a Mark become a different
Mark as pieces of it are broken off and replaced by pieces of different
Marks? Who cares? A Mark is a Mark. 


Enjoy!

Why thank you, Vanyel. Had we known about this, we may well have been
able to skip the car analogy. Of course, had we known that the frame of 
a car is the equivilant to a car's social security number, we probably
would have skipped it anyways; too much extra baggage.

What is an Entity? The only problem is that Kelly insists that the
normal Enlish definition of the word "entity" itself is not sufficient,
although she has no better suggestions for that function.

We should also point out that by using the normal English definition of
the word "entity" as we wished to in the first place, the Courts would
have the ability to decide on certain things on a case-by-case basis...

Does anyone besides Kelly object to the following Proto on any grounds?


PROTO-PROPOSAL  (Wes) 
Definition of Entities

Amend Rule 1011 to read: 

     An Entity is any thing which has definite, individual existance. A
     Nomic Entity is any Entity which exists within the context of Agora
     Nomic. A Game Entity is any Nomic Entity which exists solely within
     the context of Agora Nomic. 
     
     No Game Entity may be changed except as specified within the Rules.
     No two Nomic Entities shall share the same Name or official
     Nickname.

So anything which is permitted is still permitted, anything which is
prohibited is still prohibited, and anything which is neither is allowed
by Rule 116? What's the point?

So you're saying that it's okay to make things illegal which will happen
anyways? In the beginning Agora Nomic, that sort of Rule would be
considered a Paradox and would end the Game, giving a Win to whoever
pointed it out.

please don't Promote solitary Proposals without good cause.  Assessing
lots of little batches is a pain; i'd rather have one large batch than
a lot of little ones.

my preference would be that if you don't have at least five Proposals,
don't Promote, unless you're running up against the 7 day limit.

well, that would be plain wrong, now, wouldn't it?  such an
interpretation stupidly assumes that legality and possibility are
somehow equivalent (or, rather, that illegality implies
impossibility).

it's legal, in most places, to levitate objects in the town square.
this doesn't make it possible.  in fact, it is rare that an impossible
act is made illegal, because doing so is a waste of time.  laws
generally only regulate possible behaviors.  this is, by the way, why
lesbianism has never been illegal in the UK: Queen Victoria refused to
admit the possibility of gay women, and thus refused to allow a law
making it illegal on the grounds that it was impossible.

any Rule that seeks to regulate (as opposed to describe) must
inherently admit to being broken.  this is no paradox.

if this is what you are doing, then you have changed your argument
since this particular discussion started.  this discussion began when
it was suggested that Entities could be characterized as having
"distinct, individual" existence, and i rebutted that Marks (and other
Currencies) do not appear to have "distinct, individual" existence.  i
do not deny that Marks (or, more properly, centimarks) are Entities; i
deny that they have distinct, individual existence, and is it this
point that i have been arguing.  

kindly refrain from strawmanning my arguments.

If I may be so bold, may I suggest we call these "the Smaragdine

Repeals. :)

They're the Green Repeals with a twist: all of them are AI=1, even
those that can repeal AI>1 Rules.  (The Rule that should prevent that,
recently discussed, is only AI=1, and now actually explicitly defers to
the Rules these Proposals would create.)  I think whatever name we come
up with should reflect that fact.

Oh, yeah, everyone who wanted to repeal 101, here's your
once-in-a-lifetime chance to do it by convincing a simple majority of
the Players.  That is, unless you're chicken...

Stats: of the 230 Proposals, I have voted FOR 142 and AGAINST the other
88.

As everyone has had all the time since the Green Repeals to think about
whether each Rule is really necessary, lack of time to consider each
Proposal individually is now no excuse for a blanket vote.  I may well
deKudo anyone that does a blanket vote of FOR or AGAINST.

Probably, but it does fix AI-less Directives. I'll Propose it in case

What some of us are trying to say (i.e. Kelly, Chuck and me, unless 
I'm mistaken) is that a Mark does not exist in and of itself. You can 
transfer, for instance, 1/2+1/4+1/8+...+1/N**2 Marks, with 
arbitrary N; the result is a 1-Mark transfer because of the MUQ of 
Marks, but this particular Mark has indefinitely many "components". 
In short, a Mark is not a Mark, it's an abstraction.

Personally, I reject it on the grounds that 'Marks are Entities' does 
not in any way make one single Mark an Entity. There is an inference 
here that remains to be demonstrated.

Either that, or I'll add the AI clause. BTW, I wonder which of the

And I might just dekudo someone for dekudoing someone for dekudoing
someone for something that "harmless". Morendil ought to have
the right to express approval or disapproval according to his conscience.
Of course, kelly also has that right. But then, so do I. Herald, please
note I transfer one kudo from kelly to Morendil, for the above stated
reasons, unless another Player has already done so in the interval
between our two posts.

came in so as to make for a reasonably-sized batch, giving that Kudo

Actually "waiting a few days" is not the issue here.  At the time Wes
Promoted Proposal 2057, he had already received the whatever-they-are
Repeals.  And it wouldn't have made a "reasonably-sized batch", anyway
-- what we have is a pair of very UNreasonably-sized batches.

But, er... what was the point of all that?

Surely it's not another <COLOR> Repeals scam?

Does one group plan to vote unanimously for it and reap all the repeal

This constitutes a correction to the Ruleset published earlier this
week, which was in error due to the misapplication of Proposals
1758 and 2027.  I have made a few other additions as well, most
notably the addition of most of Andre's Stare Decisis post in the
form of unofficial annotations.  This is also the first published
Ruleset to exceed 250,000 characters, so we'll see how n-o handles it.

THE LOGICAL RULESET

Rules are listed as follows, where NNNN represents the Rule Number.

----------------------------------------

Rule NNNN (MI=Mutability Index of the Rule)
Title of Rule

      Rule Text

Annotation: as required by Rule 789.  These include a list of
Relevant Rules:

[Note: annotations enclosed in brackets are my own and
 are entirely unofficial.  They have no legal force in and
 of themselves.]

History: Some Rules include a complete or partial history.
An ellipsis (...) indicates that the history is incomplete.

----------------------------------------

There are currently 230 Rules:
   16 with MI=3
    2 with MI=2
  212 with MI=1

Highest Rule Number assigned so far: 1548

The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

History:
Created by Proposal 913, date unknown
Transmuted from MI=1 to MI=Unanimity by Proposal 1020, Sep. 4 1994
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1484, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.]

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 101, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1480, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 116, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1483, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011/1 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJ 803: If 2 Rules try to give the same name to different Entities,
 the second fails; the Entities do not merge.  "Known as" is not the
 samed as "named."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]

Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

Rule 754/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

Rule 795/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in any way for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a gain or loss of Kudos by any
      means shall not be construed as a punishment.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

Rule 1497/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Truth in Advertising

      No Player shall present, as correct, information which e
      believes to be incorrect in any of the following:
        -a post to the Public Forum
        -evidence in a COE, CFJ, or Judgement
        -a response to a request for information which the
         Player is required to provide.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

      A Player who violates this Rule commits a Class B Crime.

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

Rule 1446/6 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Contest, also
      known as a subgame of Agora Nomic.

      A Contest's Compact is known as its Regulations, its
      Administrator is known as the Contestmaster, it has one Treasury
      known as the Contest Fund, and its Executor is the
      Contestmaster.

      Players, other than the Contestmaster, within the Regulation's
      Jurisdiction are known as its Contestants.  The Contestmaster is
      always within the Regulations' Jurisdiction.

      The Foundor of a Contest is its initial Contestmaster.  A
      Contest is Public, and the Notary must publish the initial
      Contest Name and Regulations in the Public Forum As Soon As
      Possible after e receives them from the Contestmaster.

[CFJ 760: If the Regulations specify that the position of
 Contestmaster is to be vacated, that is without effect.
 CFJ 800: A Contest need not be a game in the strict sense of the
 word.]

The Public Forum

      The Public Forum is any medium defined by the Distributor as
      such.  If a Rule requires that a message is send to the Public
      Forum, then a message send to all Active Players fulfills this
      requirement as well.

      The Distributor may only define a medium to be the Public Forum,
      if to the best of eir knowledge and in normal circumstances
      messages posted to it are received by all Players.  Subscription
      may be necessary to be able to receive the Public Forum, in
      which case such a subscription is mandatory to all Players.

[CFJ 707: Something sent to the PF is effective at the moment it is

      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      Let Indices be ordered such that for any two Indices X and Y, X
      is greater than Y if and only if either both X and Y are real
      numbers and X is numerically greater than Y, or X is the special
      value Unanimity and Y is a real number.

Rule 1023/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then: 

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to 
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no later than any other 
           action which the performance of the duties of that 
           Office subsequently requires em to perform;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week, 
           and no later than any other action e is subsequently 
           required to perform which is not an action performed
           in the course of carrying out Official duties.

      Failure to observe these time requirements is a Class D Crime. 
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.

Rule 1079/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

Definition of Violation

      Violation of a Compact means the failure to obey (insofar the

      Compact's Jurisdiction. Such a Violation is either Civil or
      Basic.

      Violations of a Statute are Basic Violations can also be
      Violations of the Rules empowering the Violated Statutes.

      Violations of a Warranty are Civil Violations are never, by
      themselves, Rule Violations.

      Any other Violation is Basic, unless the Rules define it
      otherwise.

      1 or greater than 4.

      A Rule which has a Mutability Index of 1 is also known as
      "Mutable"; a Rule which has a Mutability Index of Unanimity is
      also known as "Immutable".  All other Rules are known as
      "Semimutable".

Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.  Such Entities shall have whatever
      power is granted to them by the Rules.  In the event that the
      requirements of such an Entity conflicts with the Rules, the
      Rules shall always take precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities which are
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity which was
      created first under the authority of that Rule takes precedence
      over the others.

Rule 1454/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Virus

      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection".
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes.

      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (none of which is the
      number of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in
      that week. 

      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e
      shall announce that no Rule has been infected.

      An infected Rule is amended in the following way, given that
      other Rules permit it: if the Rule does not already contain the
      sentence "This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not
      contain this sentence.", then that sentence is appended to the
      Rule. If the Rule already contains the sentence, then the
      sentence is deleted from the Rule.

      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.

Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration, unless another Rule 
      forbids that person from Registering.  No person may be
      registered as a Player more than once concurrently.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose, then the
      use of that Player's Agora nickname is preferred, but not
      obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is allowed.

Putting Oneself on Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending

      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.  An Active Player is a Player who is not On
      Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of em, including
      appointment as a Judge.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties

Rule 1042/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration Due to Inactivity

      A Voter shall be deregistered when any Player correctly reports

        a. The Voter in question is not On Hold and has not sent a
           message to the Public Forum or to any Player of a nature
           which must be recorded in a Report which then becomes
           publically available during the fourteen day period
           immediately preceding the posting of a message which
           announces that fact, or

        b. The Voter in question has been On Hold for the entire two
           month period immediately preceding the posting of a
           message which annnounces that fact.

      Upon the posting of any such message, the Registrar, or, in eir
      absence, the Speaker, shall, as soon as possible, determine if
      the claim is correct or not, and announce eir determinations to
      the Public Forum.  If the Registrar fails to make a report
      within seven days, the Speaker shall make the required
      verification and announcement instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might prevent a
      Player from being deregistered against eir own will.

Officers
  This Category includes Rules applying to Officers in general.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1006/4 (Mutable, MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      Offices are a class of Nomic Entities, referring generically
      to a position of authority or responsibility in Agora Nomic.

      An Office exists only if it is specifically established by the
      Rules.  If an Office ceases to be specified in the Rules, it
      ceases to exist.

      An Officer is any Player who fills an Office as specified in the
      Rules.  No Player shall be required to fill an Office without
      giving consent.  A Player indicates that e consents to fill an
      Office by posting to the Public Forum that e does so.  To be
      binding, such a post must be made not more than one week before,
      nor more than one week after, the time that the Player is
      designated to fill the Office in question.

      It is forbidden for two or more Players to hold the same Office
      at the same time.  If the Rules require that a specific Player
      fill an Office, any other Player who currently fills that Office
      ceases to do so simultaneously.

Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of

      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits a Class D Crime, unless the Records are
      unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e reports this
      fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

Rule 1431/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Claims of Error

      If a Player, hereafter called the Claimant, believes any
      official report or document to contain an error, e shall post to
      the Public Forum a statement that e believes the report to be in
      error, specifying the nature of the error, and requesting the
      Player responsible for the document, hereafter called the
      Respondant, to correct the error.  The Respondant shall
      immediately investigate the claim of error, and, as soon as
      possible after the posting of the claim, either admit the claim
      and issue an official correction to the document, or deny the
      claim.  Such admission or denial shall be posted to the Public
      Forum.

      If and only if the Respondant does not admit the claim, then
      any Player may, within one week of the posted denial (or the
      expiration of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's
      response), make a Call for Judgement alleging the document to
      be in error in the way in which the Claim of Error alleged it
      to be in error.

      If and only if the Respondant admits the claim, then any Player
      may, within one week of the posted admission (or the expiration
      of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's response),
      make a Call for Judgement alleging that the document is not in
      error in the way in which the Claim of Error alleged it to be
      in error.

      If the Respondant does not admit the claim and a subsequent Call
      for Judgement finds that the claim is true, the Respondant shall
      lose 5 points.  The Claimant is responsible for reporting this
      score change when it occurs.  There is no penalty under this
      Rule if the Respondant admits the claim and corrects the error
      without a Call for Judgement having been made.

      A claim is illegal and may not be made if:
        a) another claim has previously been made alleging the same
           error, unless this prior claim was not admitted and the
           time limit to make a CFJ has expired;
        b) the document containing the error was published more than
           21 days prior to the claim; or
        c) the Player making the claim is the same as the Player
           responsible for the document alleged to be in error.
        d) the report in error has been superceded by another report.
      
      For the purpose of this Rule, an "official report or document"
      is any report or document which an Officer (or the Speaker) is
      required to maintain by the Rules in the course of eir duties as
      that Officer (or as Speaker), and an "error" is the omission or
      inclusion of any information which causes the official report or
      document to allege that the Game State is in any way different
      than it actually is.

      No Call for Judgement may be made alleging that a document
      contains errors except as prescribed in this Rule.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might allow a
      Call for Judgement prohibited by this Rule to be made, or which
      might prohibit a Call for Judgement permitted by the Rule from
      being made.

Rule 880/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer may resign eir Office at any time either by a message
      to the Public Forum, or by going On Hold, or as otherwise
      specified in the Rules.

      When an Officer resigns eir Office, e ceases to fill that
      Office.  If an Officer resigns during the Voting Period for a
      Proposal containing a Directive to install another player in
      that Office, then the Player thus proposed, if consenting, will
      fill the Office.

      Otherwise, if at the time e resigns e appoints a successor, then
      the designated successor, if consenting, will fill the Office.
      If there is no appointed or proposed successor, or if e does not
      consent to fill the Office, then the Office becomes vacant.

      No player who is "On Hold" may fill an Office.  If an Officer
      goes On Hold then e automatically resigns all eir Offices.

      This Rule applies to Offices in General, and thus defers to
      Rules regarding specific Offices.

 not allowed to hold the Office, the Office becomes vacant.]

      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting
      such to the Public Forum.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office, and that Office becomes
      Vacant.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio is
      2.

Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1483/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of Proposals

      Any collection of text delivered by a Player to the Promoter and
      designated by the submitting Player as a Proposal is a Proposal.

      The effect of the adoption of a Proposal shall be limited to the
      application of those legally defined Rule Changes and Directives
      which are contained within the Proposal and which can be clearly
      identified as such.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

----------------------------------------

Rule 105/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:
        1) the enactment of a new Rule (a "Creation"). ;
        2) the amendment of an existing Rule (an "Amendment");
        3) the repeal of an existing Rule (a "Repeal");
        4) the modification of an existing Rule's Mutability Index (a
           "Mutation").

      Additional Rule Changes may be created by appropriate
      legislation.  No Rule Change may directly change any part of the
      Game State other than the Rules.  No Rule may be changed except
      by the means of a Rule Change of a type specified in the Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

[CFJ 700: Self-amending and self-repealing Rules are allowed.]

Rule 107/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1391, Jan. 24 1995

----------------------------------------

Rule 1339/3 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rule Changes

      There are two types of Rule Change. A Proposed Rule Change is a
      Rule Change which appears in a Proposal, and which, insofar as
      the Rules permit it to take effect, has the effect of Creating,
      Amending, Mutating, Repealing or otherwise changing a Rule as
      defined elsewhere in the Rules, directly as a result of the
      passage of a Proposal. A non-Proposed Rule Change has the same
      effect as a Proposed Rule Change, but insofar as the Rules
      permit it to take effect, it does so not as the direct result
      of the passage of a Proposal, but rather, indirectly, as the
      result of the effect or action of a Rule.

      All Rule Changes, of either type, are subject to the following
      constraints:

      An individual Rule Change must change exactly one Rule.

      Any Rule Change which affects an existing Rule must clearly
      identify the Number of the Rule to be affected.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Mutability Index of the New Rule; however, if the Mutability
      Index is specified it must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
      the Mutability Index of any Rule created by a Rule Change is not
      specified, it shall be 1.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Category to which the New Rule will be assigned.  If the
      Category specified exists, the Rule shall be assigned to that
      Category.  If the Category specified does not exist, or no
      Category is specified, the Rulekeepor shall assign the Rule to
      an appropriate category of eir own choice.

      Any Rule Change which changes the Mutability Index of a Rule
      must clearly specify the new value of the Rule's Mutability
      Index.

      Any Rule Change which changes the text of a Rule must clearly
      and unambiguously specify the changes which are to be made. If
      the Rule Change quotes old text which is to be replaced with new
      text, then the quoted old text must match exactly with actual
      text in the Rule, with the exception of whitespace and
      capitalization. This takes precedence over Rules which would
      permit such differences, even if the differences would be
      considered inconsequential by such Rules.

      Any Rule Change which does not meet these criteria shall not
      have any legal force.

[CFJ 822: Any Change to the Rules in a way other than the two methods
described here is illegal.]

Rule 594/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

Rule 993/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  If this
      is not true, then the Directive shall not take effect, even if
      the Proposal is adopted.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

[CFJ 762: If a "Directive" is not defined by the Rules, it is not
 a Directive, but is still part of the Proposal.

Legality of Proposals

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

Rule 1036/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Making and Distributing Proposals

      Let there be an Officer called the Promotor.
      The Promotor shall receive a weekly salary of 3 Points.
      A Proposal by a Player shall be made by submitting it to the
      Promotor. As soon as possible after receiving the Proposal, the
      Promotor shall assign the Proposal a Number.
      Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the Proposal, and not
      later than any subsequently received Proposal, the Promotor
      shall distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players.

      At the same time e shall distribute any text not part of the
      proposal which is required to be submitted with it, but eir
      failure to do so shall not deprive the act of distributing the
      Proposal of the effects which it would otherwise have.

[CFJ 10: A Proposal remains a Proposal even if the Promotor changes
 before the Proposal is distributed.
 CFJ 776: There is no failure of distribution if the Promotor
 announces he has received no Proposals when in fact he has, unless
 it has been more than one week since the Proposals were sent to em.]

Disowning Proposals

      A player may disown eir own proposal if it has not yet been
      distributed or if no more than four days have passed since its 
      distribution, by sending a statement disowning it to the Public 
      Forum.  

      The player so disowning a proposal loses a flat fee of five
      points, reported by the Assessor, but any other score changes,
      blots, or other effects resulting from the player's submission
      of that proposal, including but not limited to formatting
      penalties, rule repeal rewards, new player bonuses, and awards
      or penalties for votes cast on that proposal are cancelled and
      shall not be taken into account.  The disowning Player does not
      receive any Extra Votes for a Proposal he disowned, even if it
      passes. 

      Neither the Assessor nor any Player who has been Assessor since
      the beginning of the voting period on that proposal may disown a
      proposal, unless that proposal has not yet been distributed. 

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which would
      otherwise seek to reward or penalize any player based on the
      disowned proposal.

Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.
      
      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes in
      addition to an Entity's first vote may only be achieved by the
      casting of Extra Votes, if that is permitted, as specified in
      other Rules.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

      have already voted upon a given Proposal.  Doing so is not a
      Crime, unless specified as such by another Rule.

[CFJ 36: The Assessor may not use eir knowledge of the Votes to

      received by the Counting Assessor or posted to the Public Forum

      which a Vote by a Voting Entity which is not a Player or a

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or

      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege, either implicitly or explicitly, that the
            Rules generally ought to be interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that a specific Ordinance, Regulation,
            or Contract ought to be interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege, either implicitly or explicitly, that the
            Ordinances of a specific Group or the Regulations of
            a specific Contract ought to be interpreted in a certain
            way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall

      a CFJ becomes ineligible to Judge, either by declining
      Appointment, by going On Hold, by being deregistered and hence
      ceasing to be a Player, or by other means specified in the
      Rules, then the CotC shall randomly select another Eligible
      Player to Judge the CFJ.

[CFJ 723: The CotC may make another assignment, (without legal effect)
 as long as e makes one according to this Rule as well.]

Rule 408/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e gains 3 Blots and the
      CotC randomly selects another Judge from among eligible Players.
      A Judgement is delivered by submitting that Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts, who must then distribute that Judgement to
      all Players as soon as possible.

      Blots gained via this rule are reported to the Tabulator by the
      CotC.

----------------------------------------

Rule 591/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Legal Judgements

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE, or
      UNKNOWN.  The Judgement of UNDECIDABLE is reserved for those
      statements which are logically neither TRUE nor FALSE.  The
      Judgement of UNKNOWN is for those statements for which the
      Judge is unable to obtain information necessary to determine
      whether the statement is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judge must make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      information necessary to determine whether the statement
      is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
      which include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

[In the Judgement of CFJ 794, the CotC determined that a Judgement
 of the form "If X then TRUE else FALSE" is legal only if the truth-
 value of X itself is unambiguous.]

Rule 663/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE as
      provided in the rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of
      statements specifying an action or actions which must take
      place. If a Judgement is accompanied by an Injunction, that
      Injunction must be published with the Judgement. All players
      must abide by the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours
      after its publication unless one of the following conditions
      then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 665/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, if the Judge thinks it is appropriate to do so. The
      Judge may also issue an Injunction specifying any adjustments
      to the published game state which result from the allegation
      being supported. These adjustments to the game state must have
      been unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and they must be
      adjustments which occur as a direct or indirect result of the
      allegation being supported.

[CFJ 697: Such an Injunction may not specify, "all errors in the
 Public Gamestate resulting from this Error, including but not
 limited to..." as the adjustments are not unambiguously specified.
 CFJs 708 & 714: Such an Injunction may not forbid resulting illegal
 actions which have not yet taken place.
 CFJ 716: Other changes to the Gamestate may not be retracted if
 retracting the illegal move is not part of the Injunction.
 CFJ 724: Such an Injunction may only be made if the CFJ explicitly
 alleges that a certain move is illegal.
 CFJ 729: Such an Injunction may not roll back the Gamestate to before
 the illegal move occurred, if that would mean actions not dependent
 on the illegal action would be retracted.]
 CFJ 736: If a move is illegal, that does not imply that the move has
 not been made.
 CFJ 797: The CFJ itself need not specify the Injunction.]

Rule 789/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      Judge may include with the Judgement an Injunction requiring the
      Administrator of the Organization whose Compact contains the Target
      to annotate the Target with the Statement in the CFJ.

      The annotation shall remain only until the Target is changed in
      any way; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no longer
      applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall guide
      the application of the Target.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      Upon the distribution of a legal judgement to the Nomic
      community, a Concurring or a Dissenting Opinion may be filed in
      written format with the Clerk of the Courts.  The Concurring or
      Dissenting Opinion must satisfy the following criteria:

       (i) The opinion must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
           which include, but are not necessarily limited to,
           citations of deciding Rules, past Judgement, and Agora
           Conventions.

             (ii) The opinion must be sponsored by at least two active
           Agora players and the sponsors must be listed on the
           opinion.

            (iii) The opinion must be filed with the Clerk of the

             (iv) The opinion must be entitled Concurring or
           Dissenting with the Judgement.

      Once an opinion satisfies these components, the Clerk of the
      Courts must distribute the opinion to all Players as soon

      Opinions must be appended to the Legal Judgement as Concurring
      or Dissenting Opinions.

Appealing Judgement

      If within two weeks after a Judgement is distributed to the
      Public Forum, three players post to the Public Forum their
      insistence that it be appealed, then the judgement is Appealed.

      If a judgement is Appealed, the Clerk of the Courts shall within
      one week report this to the Public Forum, together with the
      statement of the CFJ.

      When this happens, the Speaker, CotC, and Justiciar shall serve
      as Justices, judging the statement as if they were Judges.  The
      Justices may confer with each other on the case before
      delivering Judgement if they desire.

      A Justice may appoint another willing Player to act as Justice;
      the player so appointed becomes Justice in eir place. A Justice
      who was ineligible to serve as Judge of the CFJ, or who was
      Judge of the CFJ, may not deliver judgement as Justice, but must
      instead so appoint another player, as soon as possible.

      No Player may deliver judgement more than once on the same CFJ; 
      rather than do so as Justice e must instead appoint another
      player to act as Justice, as soon as possible.

      If a Justice, A, is required by the Rules to appoint another
      Player as Justice, he may do so by declaring to the CotC that e
      is unable to find another willing player to so serve; in this
      case the CotC shall as soon as possible select an eligible
      player at random to serve as Justice in place of A.

      The Justices shall receive the same compensation as Judges for

      containing all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

Rule 1503/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Crime: General Definition

      Whenever a Player performs an action which is designated by the
      Rules as a Crime, and further it has been determined by a CFJ
      that in fact that this action did take place and was in fact a
      Crime, then that Player shall be subject to the penalties for
      that Crime, as defined by the Rules.  

      An action is a Crime only if there is a Rule which designates it
      to be a Crime.  The fact that an action is prohibited by the
      Rules is not sufficient to make it a Crime.  The designation of
      an action as a Crime does not in any way grant legal status to
      that action.

      A Rule which designates an action to be a Crime must also either
      specify an explicit penalty for committing that Crime, or
      designate that Crime to be one of several Classes of Crime
      defined elsewhere in the Rules.  If a Rule designates an action
      to be a Crime, but does not either specify an explicit penalty
      or specify a valid Class of Crime, then that Crime shall not
      have any associated penalty.

Application and Timing of Criminal Penalties

      All criminal penalties shall take effect 72 hours after the

      criminal act; however, if the CFJ is appealed prior to this
      time, then the penalty shall not be applied until immediately
      after the announcement of the ruling of the Appeals Court, and

      If the CFJ is appealed, but not within 72 hours, and the Appeals
      Court judges differently than the Judge of the CFJ, then all
      penalties shall be reversed to the fullest extent possible at
      the time the Appeal Court's Judgement is announced.

      Responsibility for reporting all consequences of the application
      or reversal of a Criminal penalty falls unto the Clerk of the

Rule 1507/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Infractions: General Definition

      Whenever a Player performs an action which is designated by the
      Rules as a Infraction, that Player shall be subject to the
      penalties for that Infraction, as defined by the Rules.

      An action is a Infraction only if there is a Rule which
      designates it to be a Infraction.  The fact that an action is
      prohibited by the Rules is not sufficient to make it a
      Infraction.  The designation of an action as a Infraction
      neither grants nor denies legal status to that action.

      A Rule which designates an action to be a Infraction must
      specify an explicit penalty for committing that Infraction.  If
      a Rule designates an action to be a Infraction, but does not
      specify an explicit penalty, then that Infraction shall not have
      any associated penalty.

      A Rule which designates an action to be an Infraction must
      specify the Officer who is to detect and report that Infraction,
      and only that Officer and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report that Infraction.  A report of an Infraction by a
      Player other than the Officer mandated to report such
      Infractions or the Speaker has no legal effect.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1508/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Application of Penalties for Infractions; Appeals Thereof

      All penalties for Infractions take effect at the time the first
      report of the Infraction is posted by the Player who reported
      it, provided that report was made by a Player who is legally
      authorized to make it.  The determination of the reporting
      Player is legally binding until and unless it is reversed by a
      Call for Judgement.

      Any second or subsequent report of an Infraction has no legal
      effect.

      A Player who disagrees with the determination that an action was
      an Infraction is permitted to submit a Call for Judgement
      alleging that the action was not an Infraction.

      If the Officer's determination is reversed by CFJ, then the
      penalties shall be reversed 72 hours after the Judgement is
      announced, unless the CFJ is itself appealed during this time,
      in which case the penalties are reversed immediately upon the
      announcement of the ruling of the Appeals Court, and then only
      if the Appeals Court sustains the original Judgement.  If the
      CFJ is appealed, but not within 72 hours, and the Appeals Court
      does not sustain the original Judgement, the penalties shall be
      reapplied upon the time the Appeal Courts' Judgement is
      announced.

      The responsibility for reporting all consequences of the
      application of a penalty falls unto the Player who makes the
      report of Infraction.  The responsibility for reporting all
      consequences of the reversal or reapplication of a penalty as a
      result of the appeals process falls unto the Clerk of the
      Courts, or, in eir absence, the Speaker.  This includes, but is
      not limited to, reporting any Blot Awards or Currency Transfers
      to the Tabulator or the appropriate Recordkeepors.

      Penalties for Infractions shall be limited to the loss of units
      of one or more Currencies, the award of one or more Blots, or
      both.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which requires another
      Player to report Score, Currency, or Blot changes which result
      from the commission of a Infraction, or which causes Score,
      Currency, or Blots changes resulting from the commission of a
      Infraction to take effect sooner than specified in this Rule.

Judicial Recourse for Nonreporting of Infractions

      Any Player who believes that an Infraction has occurred, but
      which has not been reported by a Player authorized to report it,
      is permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging thus.

      If the Judgement of the CFJ upholds the allegation, then the
      Judge of the CFJ shall be authorized to, and shall be obligated
      to, report the Infraction as provided by other Rules.  This Rule
      takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the Judge's
      report of an infraction from having legal effect.

The Logical Ruleset

      Whenever the Rulekeepor publishes the complete Rule Set, e shall
      do so in the "Logical Rule Set Format". In this format, each
      Rule is assigned to a principal Category, and the Rules are
      grouped according to their Category. Within a Category, the
      ordering of Rules is decided by the Rulekeepor. All existing
      Rule Categories must be listed, along with a brief description,
      whether or not any Rules currently are assigned to the Category.

      Whenever a new Rule is added, it is assigned to the most
      appropriate Category in the opinion of the Rulekeepor, who must
      choose from existing Categories. Alternatively, the Rulekeepor
      may create a new Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new
      Category, if this is permitted by other Rules. Once e assigns a
      Rule to a Category, e may not change it except as provided by
      other Rules.

      However, if the Proposal itself stipulates a specific Category,
      as provided for by other Rules, the Rulekeepor is required to

Titles For Rules

      All Rules have a Title, which is a single line of text

      by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule. However, they are not
      part of the Rule itself and have no effect on the application of
      the Rule, being merely a convenience for the Players. Titles,
      once assigned, may not be altered except as specified in this
      and other Rules.

      For a new Rule created as a result of a Rule Change Proposal:

      If the Rule Change Proposal specifies the Title within the body
      of the Proposal, that Title is assigned. Otherwise the
      Rulekeepor chooses a Title.

      For a new Rule created by other means:

      If the procedure which caused the Rule to be created specifies
      a way to determine the Title, then that Title is assigned.
      Otherwise, the Rulekeepor chooses a Title.

      To change the Title of an existing Rule:

      A Rule's Title may be changed by a Directive.  The Directive
      must unambiguously state the number of the Rule and the new
      Title.

      Titles for old Rules with no Titles:

      If a Rule has no Title, because it was created at a time when
      this Rule did not apply, the Rulekeepor shall choose a Title for
      that Rule.

      information to appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule
      Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in

Rule 1367/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Degrees

      There shall exist a subset of the Patent Titles known as
      Degrees. A Patent Title is only a Degree if it is specifically
      made such by a Rule. A person may use a Degree with their name
      for any official or unofficial business if and only if that
      person currently possesses that Degree.

      Persons may come to possess Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person possesses a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      The Registrar shall note in eir report which persons possess
      which Degrees.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default

=======================================
Currencies
  This Category includes Rules concerning Currencies in general.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1467/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of a Currency

      A Currency is a type of Nomic Entity.  Only those Nomic Entities
      which are specifically defined by the Rules as being Currencies
      are Currencies.

      A Currency must have a Name (which must not be the name of any
      other Currency), a minimum unit quantity, a Recordkeepor, and a
      Mintor.  The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is not
      otherwise defined.

      The minimum unit quantity (MUQ) of a Currency is the smallest
      amount of that Currency which may be transferred.  All
      transfers, holdings, and calculations involving a given Currency
      shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of its MUQ.  The
      MUQ of a given Currency is 1, unless another Rule specifies a
      different MUQ for that Currency.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency is the Player who is required to
      maintain a record of the amount of that Currency held in the
      various Treasuries which exist.  If a Currency ceases to have a
      valid Recordkeepor, the Banker (or, in eir absence, the Speaker)
      shall fulfill that responsibility until a new Recordkeepor is
      selected according to the appropriate procedures.  If no
      procedure exists to select a new recordkeepor, all units of the
      Currency are instead destroyed, and the Currency ceases to
      exist.

      The Mintor of a Currency is the Nomic Entity which is authorized
      to create and destroy units of that Currency.  If the Mintor of
      a Currency ceases to exist, all units of the Currency are
      immediately destroyed, and the Currency also ceases to exist.

      The Banker shall maintain a record of all existing Currencies
      and their MUQs, Recordkeepors, and Mintors.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1468/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of a Treasury

      A Treasury is a repository for holding Currencies.  Currencies
      may exist only within a Treasury.  A Treasury may contain a
      positive, negative, or zero quantity of a given Currency, unless
      otherwise prohibited by the Rules.  Currencies may be
      transferred between Treasuries only as specified in the Rules.

      Only those Nomic Entities which are authorized by the Rules to
      possess Treasuries may possess Treasuries.  No Treasury may be
      possessed by more than one Nomic Entity.  The possession of
      Treasuries may never be changed, once created.

      Each Player and each Group has a Treasury of its own.

      Whenever an Entity possesses only one Treasury, it shall be a
      permissible and unambiguous abbreviation to state that the
      Entity possesses the Currencies within its Treasury.

[CFJ 802: If an Entity ceases to exist, its Treasury does too.]

Rule 1469/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation and Destruction of Treasuries

      Whenever an Entity which is permitted to possess a Treasury is
      created, or an existing Entity is granted the permission to
      possess a Treasury, a Treasury is created for that Entity.  Such
      a new Treasury shall initially contain no Currencies, unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules.

      Whenever an Entity which possesses a Treasury ceases to exist or
      ceases to be permitted to possess a Treasury, all Currencies
      within are immediately transferred to the Treasuries of the
      Mintors of the respective Currencies, and the Treasury itself
      is destroyed.

      The Banker shall report the creation or destruction of a
      Treasury to the Public Forum as soon as possible after such
      creation or destruction takes place, unless this creation or
      destruction is the immediate and direct consequence of an action
      which is also required to be reported in the Public Forum, in
      which case that notification is sufficient, and no further
      notification is required of the Banker.

      A legal notification of the destruction of a Treasury is also,
      by implication, a report of the transfer of all Currencies
      within that Treasury to their Mintors as required by this Rule.

Executors

      The Rules may, for any given non-Player Nomic Entity, specify a
      Player, or the means to designate a Player, who shall act as the
      Executor of that Entity.  The Executor of a non-Player Nomic
      Entity shall have the legal authority to act on behalf of that
      Entity, as if e were that Entity.  The Rules may also specify
      constraints on how the Executor of an Entity may act.

      If a non-Player Nomic Entity has no Executor, it may not act
      except as specifically required of it by the Rules.

      The Executor of a Group is that Group's Vizier.  

      For the sake of completeness, a Player is eir own Executor.

Rule 1471/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, create new units of
      that Currency, so long as this creation is permitted by the
      Rules.  These newly-created units of Currency are placed in the
      Treasury of the Mintor.  Units of Currency may not otherwise be
      created except as specifically authorized by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.

      The Mintor of the Currency shall notify the Recordkeepor of the
      Currency as soon as possible after it creates or destroys Units
      of Currency.

      A Mintor must have a Treasury.

Rule 1472/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      It shall be legal to transfer Currencies between Treasuries,
      provided this is done in accordance with the Rules.  Every
      transfer shall involve a positive amount of exactly one
      Currency, which shall be transferred from exactly one Treasury
      into exactly one other Treasury.  Every transfer has an
      initiator, which is the Entity which causes the transfer to take
      place.

      A transfer which is explicitly and directly required to take
      place by a Rule is initiated by that Rule, and is called a Class
      I Transfer.

      A transfer which is required to take place by an Entity (other
      than the Rules) to which the Rules have granted the power to
      require Currency Transfers to take place is initiated by that
      Entity (_not_ the Rule which grants that power to that Entity),
      and is called a Class II Transfer.

      A transfer which is not required to take place, and which is
      instead the consequence of a Player's action, is initiated by
      that Player, and is a called a Class III Transfer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a Rule, or an Entity other than
      the Rules to which the Rules have granted the power to require
      Players to perform actions, which requires a Player to initiate
      a transfer is _not_ requiring the transfer.  Such a transfer is
      a Class III transfer initiated by that Player.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would require a Player to
      initiate a transfer which is prohibited by this Rule.

      A Class I transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule which
      specifies a Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II transfer is not permitted if there is no Rule, or
      Entity other than the Rules to which the Rules have granted the
      power to require Players to perform actions, which specifies a
      Player who is to detect and report the transfer.

      A Class II or Class III Transfer is not permitted if the
      Treasury from which the Currency is being transferred will
      possess a negative quantity of that Currency after the transfer
      has been completed.

      A Class III Transfer is not permitted unless the transfer is
      initiated by the Executor of the Owner of the Treasury from
      which the Currency is being transferred.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit a
      transfer prohibited by this Rule.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified of a transfer
      involving that Currency within seven days, unless another Rule
      specifies a different time limit for reporting a certain type of
      transfer.  For a Class I or Class II transfer, the notification
      shall be made by the Player required to detect and report it.
      For a Class III transfer, the notification shall be made by the
      Player who initiated it.

      Class I and Class II transfers take place at the time they are
      required to take place.  Class III transfers take place at the
      time they are reported.

One EV a Week for Successful Proposals

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, every Player who had

      during the Nomic Week immediately preceding shall receive one
      Extra Vote from the Bank.  

      These transfers shall be detected and reported by the Assessor.

Rule 1488/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Nomic Potato

      Let there be an Entity known as the Nomic Potato.  There is only
      one Potato which cannot be destroyed.  The Potato can be
      possessed by any Agora Player who owns Extra Votes (EVs).  A
      Player with no EVs cannot possess the Potato, and if the Player
      possessing the Potato ever ceases to own EVs, e also loses
      possession of the Potato.

      If the Potato's possessor ceases to possess the Potato though
      ceasing to own EVs, or ceasing to be a Player, or in any other
      way not otherwise described by the Rules pertaining to the Nomic
      Potato, the possession of the Potato immediately passes to the
      Player who owns the greatest number of EVs.

      If more than one Player is tied for the greatest number of EVs,
      the Potato is transferred to the tied Player who:
      
        i) Has not previously possessed the Potato; providing all
           other tied Players have previously possessed the Potato.

       ii) Has not possessed the Potato for the longest consecutive
           period of time immediately prior to the Potato's transfer;
           providing all other tied Players have previously possessed
           the Potato.

      iii) has been randomly selected by the Assessor,
           provided neither i) or ii) apply.

      As long as at least one Player owns EVs, the Potato is always in
      some Player's possession. The only time that the Potato is not
      possessed by a Player is when no Player owns EVs.

      The Assessor keeps track of who possesses the Potato.

Benefits and Hazards of possessing the Potato

      The Player possessing the Potato receives the following
      benefits:

        i) e receives five points from the Bank for every full Nomic
           week e possesses the Potato.

       ii) e receives three points from the Bank for every EV e spends
           while e possesses the Potato.  (These points are received
           at the time the vote is cast, and the Potato must be
           possessed at that time.)

      iii) e receives fifteen points and 1 EV from the Bank when 
           another Player spends five points to transfer the
           Potato away from eir possession.

     The Player possessing the Potato suffers the following penalties:

       i) e loses two EVs for every full Nomic week e possesses the
          Potato and does not spend at least one EV while voting.
          (This does not apply during any Nomic Week in which no
          Proposals are up for vote.)

      ii) e loses two EVs if e possesses the Potato at the End of the
          Game.

      Point changes as a result of this Rule are Reported to the
      Scorekeepor by the Assessor.
   
      EV changes as a result of this rule are detected by the

The Potato is Transferred

      Any Player who does not possess the Potato can spend five points
      to transfer the Potato to any Player who can legally own the
      Potato.  (This can even be to the transferring Player, provided
      e may possess the Potato.)  Each Player is limited to one such
      transfer every week.

      The transfer is made when the transferring Player posts a
      message in the Public Forum, reporting to the Assessor which
      Player the Potato is being transferred to. If the Player being
      transferred to is eligible to possess the Potato, and the
      transferring Player possesses at least five points, the transfer
      is made and the Assessor reports the transferring Player's score
      change to the Scorekeepor.  The five points go to the Bank.

Powers
  This Category includes Rules concerning the Currency of Powers.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1517/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of the Powers

      There is a class of Nomic Entities called the Powers. An Entity
      is a Power if and only if it designated by the Rules to be so.
      Powers are a Currency. The Mintor of the Powers is the Mint.
      The Recordkeepor for the Powers is the Assessor.

      Instances of Powers are called Cards. A Player may use a Power
      only if e possesses a Card of that Power. A Player uses a Power
      by 'casting' it upon an Active Player, which may be emself.
      Powers may only be cast by Active Players. A Player must inform
      the Assessor whenever e casts a Power, otherwise the Power is
      not legally cast.

      The casting Player is called the Caster. Rules which create
      specific Powers may specify that that Power may not be cast or
      may only be cast by certain Players, or on certain Players. 

      If the casting of a Power requires the specification by the
      Caster of a Proposal or Proposals to which it applies, then all
      Proposals so specified by the Caster must be ones for which the
      Voting Period has commenced and not yet concluded, or the Power
      is not legally cast. If a Card of such a Power is legally
      cast, it is In Limbo until the Voting Periods of all specified
      Proposals have ended.

      The following are generally true of all Cards, unless a Rule
      defining a specific Power says otherwise of the Power which
      that Rule defines:

      1) exactly one Card of a given type exists at any time.
      2) when a Card is not held by any Player, it is held by
         the Bank.
      3) provided that the Bank holds at least one Card of a 
         given type, Players may purchase a Card of that type 
         from the Bank.
      4) the purchase price of a Card is 30 Marks.
      5) when a Player uses a Card, or if e does not use it
         within a week of having acquired it, either from the
         Bank or from another Player, it is returned to the Bank.
      6) a Player who possesses a Card but who has not yet made
         use of it may trade it to another Player as e sees fit.
      7) Cards which are In Limbo may not be cast.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      transfers which occur as a result of the use of Powers.

Rule 1518/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Purchasing and Trading Powers

      No Player may possess more than two Cards in any ten day
      period. This restriction is called 'the ten day restriction'. 
      For the purposes of this Rule, each acquisition of a Card by a
      Player counts as a new possession of a Card by that Player.  If
      the transfer of a Card to Player would result in that Player
      violating the ten day restriction, then the transfer is
      cancelled and does not take place. This Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which requires or permits transfers prohibited by
      this Rule from taking place.

      A Player purchases a Card from the Bank by sending a message to
      the Public Forum indicating that e transfers the purchase price
      of that Card to the Bank, and indicating which Card it is that
      e wishes to purchase, provided that the purchase does not
      violate the ten day restriction.

      A Player trades a Card to another Player by sending a message
      to the Public Forum indicating that e transfers the Card to that
      Player, provided that the trade does not violate the ten day
      restriction.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit
      these transactions to take place without notification in the
      Public Forum.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1520/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Power of Immunity

      There is a Power called the Power of Immunity. There are 4
      Immunity Cards. A Player who possesses an Immunity Card may
      only cast the Power on emself. A Player upon whom the Power
      of Immunity is cast is called an Immune Player.  A Card of the
      Power of Immunity is in Limbo for ten days after it is cast.

      The effect of the Power of Immunity is to neutralize the
      effects of Powers upon the Immune Player, other than those
      Powers cast by the Immune Player emself, for a period
      commencing three days prior to the casting of the Power, and
      concluding ten days after the Power is cast. A Power which is
      neutralized in this way is called a Neutralized Power. The
      Power of Immunity does not cancel the castings of Neutralized
      Powers upon an Immune Player; rather, it deprives them of any
      effects on an Immune Player which they might otherwise have.

      The purchase price of a Power which is Neutralized because a
      Player is Immune is transferred from the Bank to the Caster of
      the Neutralized Power. For a Neutralized Power which has been
      cast prior to the casting of the Power of Immunity, this
      transfer takes place when the Power of Immunity is cast. For a
      Neutralized Power which is cast after the Power of Immunity is
      cast, this transfer takes place at the time the Neutralized
      Power is cast. The Assessor is responsible for detecting these
      transfers and reporting them to the appropriate Recordkeepor.

      This Rules takes precedence over all other Rules which define
      specific Powers.

Rule 1521/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Oracle Power

      There is a Power called the Oracle Power. There are two Oracle
      Cards. The Player upon whom the Oracle Power is cast is called
      the Oracle. The Oracle Power may not be cast by or on the
      Assessor.

      When a Player is the Oracle, e must predict whether a
      particular Proposal, specified by the Caster, will pass or
      fail. This prediction must be made in a message to the Public
      Forum, before the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
      The Oracle may predict at most one of the outcomes, pass or
      fail. If the Oracle predicts the outcome of the vote on that
      Proposal correctly, then 10 points and are transferred from the
      Caster to the Bank, and from the Bank to the Oracle. If the
      prediction of the Oracle is incorrect, or if the Oracle makes no
      prediction before the close of the Voting Period, then 3 Extra
      Votes are transferred from the Oracle to the Caster, and 50
      points are transferred from the Oracle to the Bank, and from
      the Bank to the Caster.

      The Caster casts the Oracle Power upon a Player by sending a
      message to the Public Forum specifying that that Player is to
      be the Oracle. In the same message, the Caster must also state
      on which Proposal the Oracle is to make eir prediction. This
      Proposal must be one for which the first half of the Voting
      Period has not yet finished, at the time the message appears in
      the Public Forum. Unless all these conditions are met, the
      Power is not legally cast.

      In the case where the casting of the Oracle Power conflicts in
      its effects with the casting of another Power, then unless the
      other Power explicitly claims precedence over all other Rules
      which define specific Powers, this Rule takes precedence over
      that other Rule if the Oracle Power was cast later than the
      Power defined by the other Rule, and defers to it if the Oracle
      Power was cast earlier than the Power defined in the other
      Rule. Otherwise, this Rule defers to the other Rule.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      transfers which occur as a result of this Rule.

Rule 1522/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Power of Influence

      There is a Power called the Power of Influence. A Player on
      whom the Power of Influence is cast is called an Influential
      Player. The effect of the Power of Influence is to increase
      the maximum number of votes which the Influential Player may
      cast on a single Proposal, specified by the Caster, called the
      Influenced Proposal. The maximum number of votes which may be
      cast by the Influential Player on the Influenced Proposal may
      be increased to 3, 4, or 5 votes, depending on the price last
      paid to the Bank in order to purchase the Power. The purchase
      price of the Power of Influence increases according to the
      extent of the Influence granted by the use of the Power, and
      this greater influence is granted by the Power of Influence
      only if the Bank is paid for it, as set out below:

      A maximum of 3 votes :  30 Marks
      A maximum of 4 votes :  60 Marks
      A maximum of 5 votes : 120 Marks

      A Player casts the Power of Influence by sending a message to
      the Assessor specifying which player is to be the Influential
      Player, and which Proposal is to be the Influential Proposal.

      In the case where the casting of the Power of Influence
      conflicts in its effects with the casting of another Power,
      then unless the other Power explicitly claims precedence over
      all other Rules which define specific Powers, this Rule takes
      precedence over that other Rule if the Power of Influence was
      cast later than the Power defined by the other Rule, and defers
      to it if the Power of Influence was cast earlier than the Power
      defined in the other Rule. Otherwise, this Rule defers to the
      other Rule.

Rule 1523/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Power of Quiet

      There is Power called the Power of Quiet. There are 3 Quiet
      Cards. The purchase price for each of these Cards is 10 Marks.
      The effect of this Power is to prevent the Player on whom it is
      cast, called the Quiet Player, from casting any Extra Votes on
      a Proposal specified by the Caster, called the Quiet Proposal.
      The Power of Quiet may not be cast by the Assessor.

      A Quiet Player is not permitted to cast Extra Votes on their
      Quiet Proposal. If a Quiet Player has already cast Extra Votes
      on their Quiet Proposal at the time they become Quiet, then
      these Extra Votes are without effect on the Quiet Proposal, and
      Extra Votes equal in number to those cast by the Quiet Player on
      the Quiet Proposal are transferred from the Bank to the Quiet
      Player. The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting
      these transfers.

      The Caster casts the Power of Quiet by sending a message to the
      Assessor unambiguously identifying the Player who is to be
      the Quiet Player, and the Proposal which is to be the Quiet
      Proposal. Unless this condition is met, the Power is not
      legally cast.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which describe the
      circumstances in which Players may legally cast Extra Votes,
      with the exception of Rules which describe the effects of other
      Powers. This Rule also takes precedence over other Rules which
      describe the effects of legally cast Extra Votes on Proposals.

      In the case where the casting of the Quiet Power conflicts in
      its effects with the casting of another Power, then unless the
      other Power explicitly claims precedence over all other Rules
      which define specific Powers, this Rule takes precedence over
      that other Rule if the Quiet Power was cast later than the
      Power defined by the other Rule, and defers to it if the Quiet
      Power was cast earlier than the Power defined in the other
      Rule. Otherwise, this Rule defers to the Rule defining the
      other Power.

Rule 1540/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Skeptic Power

      There is a Power called the Skeptic Power. There are two
      Skeptic Cards. The Caster of the Skeptic Power is called the
      Skeptic; the Player on whom the Skeptic Power is cast is called
      the Believer. The Skeptic Power may not be cast by or on the
      Assessor.

      A Player casts the Skeptic Power by sending a message to the
      Public Forum clearly and unambiguously identifying the Player
      who is to be the Believer. In the same message, the Skeptic
      must give the number of a Proposal, called the Doubtful
      Proposal, which has been proposed by the Believer, for which
      the first half of the Voting Period has not yet finished, and
      state that e, the Skeptic, doubts that this Proposal will pass.
      Unless all these conditions are met, the Power is not legally
      cast.

      The Believer must, before the conclusion of the Voting Period 
      of the Doubtful Proposal, indicate in a message to the Public
      Forum, whether e concurs with or dissents from the doubt of the
      Skeptic. If e makes no such indication, then e is assumed to
      have dissented.

      If the Believer indicates that e concurs with the doubt of the
      Skeptic, then the Believer is penalized 30 points, which are
      transferred to the Bank, and from the Bank to the Skeptic.

      If the Believer dissents from the doubt of the Skeptic, then if
      the Doubtful Proposal fails, the Believer is penalized 3 Extra
      Votes, which are transferred from the Believer to the Skeptic,
      and 50 points, which are transferred from the Believer to the
      Bank, and from the Bank to the Skeptic. If, however, the
      Doubtful Proposal passes, then the Skeptic is penalized 3 Extra
      Votes, which are transferred from the Skeptic to the Believer,
      and 20 points, which are transferred from the Skeptic to the
      Bank, and from the Bank to the Believer.

      In the case where the casting of the Skeptic Power conflicts in
      its effects with the casting of another Power, then unless the
      other Power explicitly claims precedence over all other Rules
      which define specific Powers, this Rule takes precedence over
      that other Rule if the Skeptic Power was cast later than the
      Power defined by the other Rule, and defers to it if the
      Skeptic Power was cast earlier than the Power defined in the
      other Rule. Otherwise, this Rule defers to the the Rule
      defining the other Power.

      The Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting all
      Currency transfers which occur as a result of this Rule.

      awarded if the Player holding the Office has received an Extra 
      Vote in the previous Nomic Week.

      Whenever a Proposal is Distributed, the Wizard may create up to
      3 Style Points and cause them to be transferred to the Player

      Herald may not become Tabulator, nor may the Tabulator become
      Scorekeepor or Herald.

      The Tabulator is the Officer responsible for keeping track of
      the Blots possessed by each Player, as well as all ex-Players
      who have Blots.  The Tabulator may have other duties as defined
      in the Rules.

      Once a Week The Tabulator shall post to the Public Forum a
      report of the Blots held by each Player.  If a Player has earned
      Blots since the last report, this report must publicize the
      reason for the gain in Blots.

      The Tabulator's salary shall be four Points per Week.

      If any Rule mandates a change in Blots, but does not also
      specifically state the Player who is Legally Responsible for
      detecting the change and reporting it to the Tabulator, then the
      change in Blots is canceled.

      If a Blot change is not reported within four Weeks of its

Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgment (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Mutability Index of the violated
      Rule rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if

      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Tabulator.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ, unless e already had fewer than that number of Blots,
      in which case e shall lose all his Blots.  The Player losing
      the Blots has responsibility for reporting that loss to the

Rule 1440/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Erasing Blots

      A Player may Erase eir Blots by spending five Points for each
      Blot Erased. A Player may Erase any number of Blots as long as
      e does not reduce eir Point total below zero.  A Player with
      less than five Points may not Erase Blots.

      The Player must notify both the Scorekeepor and the Tabulator,
      in the Public Forum, of the number of Blots e is erasing, and
      the number of Points e is spending to do so.

      If this requires more Points than the Player has at the time of
      the request, then no Blots are erased, and no Points are lost.

      If there are sufficient Points, the Player's Point and Blot
      totals are reduced by the requested amount.

      Other rules may define additional methods of Erasing Blots.

      is not Immaculate has eir total Blots halved, rounding down to
      the next lower integer.  This halving will never reduce a
      Player's total Blots below one.

      Detecting and reporting this Blot change is the Tabulator's

Blots and Reregistration

      If a Player who is not Immaculate is deregistered and
      subsequently returns to the Game, e returns with B/(2^T) Blots,
      where B is the number of Blots the Player had upon
      deregistering, and T is the number of months since eir
      deregistration.  The number of Blots thus received is rounded
      down to the next whole integer, but not reduced below one Blot.

      If a Immaculate Player deregisters, e is also Immaculate upon
      returning to the Game.

      If a former Player returns to the Game and has no Blots
      recorded, e is Immaculate upon eir return.

      Blot Changes due to this Rule are detected and reported by the
      Tabulator.

Rule 112/2 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be
      defined by other Rules. A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
      defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,
      provided that no Win-Preventing conditions are also occurring at
      that time for that Player.

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

End of a Game Due to a Win

      A Game ends when a Win occurs. If there is more than one
      simultaneous Winner, there is nevertheless only one Game end.
      When a Game ends due to a Win:
      
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
          Speaker-Elect. If there was already a Speaker-Elect, the old
          Speaker-Elect ceases to be Speaker-Elect.

        - If there is more than one Winner, the Winner with the
          highest Point total becomes the Speaker-Elect. If more than
          one Winner is tied for the highest score, the Speaker
          randomly selects one of them to be Speaker-Elect. If there
          was already a Speaker-Elect, the old Speaker-Elect ceases to
          be Speaker-Elect.

        - For every Treasury other than the Bank, if that Treasury
          possesses Points, a commensurate number of Marks computed
          using the secondary Mark Exchange Rate are transferred from
          the Bank to that Treasury, and all Points in that Treasury
          are transferred to the Bank.  These transfers are to be
          detected and reported by the Scorekeepor.

        - A new Game is begun. All Rules and Proposals retain the

Replacement of Impossible Speaker

Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When a Speaker or Speaker-Elect is to be filled according to the

      Promotor
      Assessor
      Justiciar
      Clerk of the Courts
      Assistant
      Rulekeepor
      Registrar
      Archivist
      <all other Officers in descending point order>
      <all other Voters in descending point order>

      with the order determined at the time the Call for Volunteers is
      made.

      Any Rule which requires a Speaker or Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, a Speaker or Speaker-Elect shall
      not be chosen according to that Rule, and this Rule takes
      precedence over such Rules.

      When the position of Speaker or Speaker-Elect is to be filled,
      the Arbiter of Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce
      that fact to the Public Forum in a Call for Volunteers.  All
      Voters who are willing to fill the position shall indicate such
      in a message to the Arbiter of Succession, within three days of
      the Call for Volunteers.  If there are no volunteers, the
      Arbiter of Succession shall make another Call for Volunteers.

      As soon as possible after the end of the three-day period, and
      within four days after the end of that three-day period, the
      Arbiter of Succession shall announce which Voter, of those who
      indicated a willingness to fill the position, is highest on the
      order of succession.  That Voter shall immediately
      become Speaker or Speaker-Elect, whichever position was to be
      filled.  If e becomes Speaker, the old Speaker shall become a
      Voter.

      The Arbitration Period is defined as the period in the Order
      of Succession starting with the Call for Volunteers and ending
      with:
        1) the announcement by the Arbiter of Succession of the new
           Speaker or Speaker-Elect;
        2) the filling of the position to be filled by another method;
        3) the time when it becomes no longer necessary to complete
           the Order of Succession, according to other Rules;
        4) or seven days after the Call for Volunteers is issued;
      whichever comes first.

      If the Arbitration Period ends without any of the first three
      criteria for the end of the Arbitration Period being fulfilled,
      then a new Order of Succession shall begin to fill the required
      position, with the first Voter to post eir willingness to the

      who have already served as Arbiter of Succession for this
      particular requirement to fill the position.

      Speaker-Elect.  Only one Voter may be Speaker-Elect at any one
      time.  A Voter may not become Speaker-Elect except as specified
      in the Rules.  The position of Speaker-Elect is not an Office.

      Whenever there is a Speaker-Elect:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the

          Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall become a Voter and
          the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.
          
      If the Speaker-Elect changes before the completion of this
      procedure, it must be begun again from step 1.

      If another Rule specifies that the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker before the completion of step 3, then this Rule defers
      to it, and the procedure above need not be completed.

      If a Rule requires that the position of Speaker is to

      procedure for Speaker-Elect is not completed, and the position
      of Speaker is filled according to that Rule.  This Rule
      takes precedence over Rules requiring the position of

Rule 1529/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts: Statutes, and Warranties

      The Compact of an Organization is a text consisting of
      either or both of the following elements:

         i) Statutes; All Statutes must be obeyed by Players within
            the Compact's Jurisdiction as if those Statues were Rules.

        ii) Warranties; All Warranties shall be obeyed by Players
            within the Compact's Jurisdiction or those Players shall
            invoke penalties defined within the Rules or the Compact.

      A Compact can only possess those elements allowed it by the
      Rules defining its Class of Organization.  If these Rules do not
      specify, the Compact may only consist of Warranties.  If an
      Organization exists whose Class is not defined in the Rules,
      that Organization may not possess a Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules referring to
      Compacts.

[CFJ 830: Being a Statute causes a part of a Compact to be legally
 binding, rather than vice versa.]

Rule 1530/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts: Jurisdiction

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's Compact is a subset of the
      set of all Players. A Compact has no force to require, or
      oblige, anything of Players who are not within its Jurisdiction.
      (This does not absolve any Players of duties required of them by
      the Rules.)

      Within its Jurisdiction, a Compact's ability to dictate Players'
      activity is limited to the extent permitted by the Rules.

      A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over Players permitted to
      it by the Rules governing its Class of Organization.

      No Compact may have effect prior to its Creation, nor may it
      have effect subsequent to its dissolution.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule governing
      Compacts.

[CFJ 818: If the Rules regarding a certain class of Organization are
 silent on which Players can be under Jurisdiction of its Compact,
 Organizations of that class have no Players under its Jurisdiction.]

      E must record any and all changes to the Compact, and must, As
      Soon As Possible after such changes, distribute an up-to-date
      copy of the Compact to every Player within the Compact's
      Jurisdiction.

      E must also notify the Notary whenever the Executor (if any) of
      eir Organization Changes.  When the Administrator of an
      Organization changes, the new Administrator must inform the
      Notary of this change.  These notifications must be made As Soon
      As Possible.

      The Administrator of an Organization must come from within the
      Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact unless otherwise
      specified by the Rules governing its Class.

      any and all transfers out of the Organization's Treasury.  The
      Executor may only transfer funds as permitted by the Rules

      may be further bound by the Compact of eir Organization.   The
      Executor of an Organization must come from within the

      cast extra Votes on a Proposal as if those Organizations were
      Players.

      Such extra Votes may only be cast by the Executor of the voting
      Organization notifying the Assessor.

Rule 1533/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation of Organizations, and Their Compacts

      Organizations (and, simultaneously, their initial Compacts) are
      created in the following manner:

      A set of Players, known as the Foundors, sends a message to the
      Notary containing the following information:

         i) The Class of the created Organization.
        ii) The Unique Name of the particular Organization being
            created.
       iii) The inital Compact for the proposed Orginization.
        iv) Any information required by Rules governing that specific
            Class of Organization.

      The Organization is created, and its Foundors enter the
      Jurisdiction of its Compact, once the Notary receives the above
      information from all Founders required by the Rules governing
      the Organization's Class.  If such Foundors are not defined, the
      Organization cannot be created.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which does not
      explicitly state that it takes precedence over the default Rules
      for Organizations.

Rule 1536/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Treasuries of Dissolving Organizations

      If an Organization is to dissolve, and if a provision exists
      within its Compact for dividing its Treasuries (if any) upon
      dissolution, the Treasuries are divided in accordance with this
      provision before its dissolution.  Otherwise, the Treasuries are
      divided as evenly as possible among all Players within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction before its dissolution.

      The Executor of the Organization notifies all appropriate
      Recordkeepors of the above Transfers.  If no Executor exists,
      and there is no provision in the Rules or the Compact for
      someone to act as Executor, all Treasuries' contents go to the
      Bank. (Detected by the relevant Recordkeepors.)

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules demanding a
      different distribution of such Treasuries' assets.

Rule 1535/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compact Defaults

      The Compact of an Organization can specify any or all of the
      following.

        i) How the Compact, and/or the Name of its Organization, can
           be Changed. If this is not specified, it may only be
           changed by unanimous consent of Players within the
           Compact's Jurisdiction.  Consent is shown by a Player by
           sending an identical copy of the change to the Notary.  The
           change takes effect when the last Player so consents.

           In all cases, when the Name of an Organization changes, the
           Administrator must inform the Notary of the new Name As
           Soon As Possible.

       ii) How the Organization can be dissolved.  If this is not
           specified, the Organization cannot dissolve unless it is
           required to do so by the Rules.

           As Soon As Possible after an Organization's dissolution,
           the Player who was the last Administrator of that
           Organization must inform the Notary of that Organization's
           dissolution

      iii) How additional Players enter the Jurisdiction of the
           Compact.  If this is not specified, the Compact cannot
           expand its Jurisdiction.

       iv) How individual Players leave the Jurisdiction of the
           Compact.  If this is not specified, the Compact can only
           lose Jurisdiction over a Player when the Rules require it
           to do so.

           Whenever there is any change in a Compact's Jurisdiction,
           the Administrator of its Organization must inform the
           Notary of the change As Soon As Possible.

           These defaults defer to language applying to a specific
           Class of Organization.

Rule 1534/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Compacts Can Require Some Currency Transfers

      An Organization's Compact is empowered to require Currency
      transfers.  If it does so, these transfers are reported by the
      Executor in the case of an Organization with Treasuries, or the
      Administrator Otherwise.

      An Organization's Compact is empowered to require Currency
      transfers that are made from the Treasuries it possesses (if any
      such exist) or from a Player within the Jurisdiction of its
      Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit a
      Compact to require a transfer prohibited by this Rule.

Compacts as Evidence

      If a Judge or Justice requires disclosure of part of any

      the Administrator of that Organization is required to provide a
      copy of that Compact to the Judge or Justice As Soon As Possible
      after the Judge's or Justice's request.

      If this involves a Compact from a Private Organization, the
      Judge or Justice receiving it is bound by the strictures
      governing the dissemination of the contents of that Compact, and
      is prohibited from attaching a copy of it to eir Judgement as
      evidence.

      This takes precedence over any Rule which would require a Judge
      or Justice to include the Compact of a Private Organization as
      part of the evidence justifying eir Ruling.

Groups

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Group.

      A Group's Compact consists only of Statutes, and are known
      collectively as its Ordinances, an individual Statute of its
      Compact is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as
      the Group's Ordinancekeepor.  A Group has one Treasury, and its
      Executor is known as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group is the Mintor of an associated form of Currency.  The
      generic name of all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific
      name of a Group's Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the
      Name of the Group.

      Players within the Ordinances' Jurisdiction are known as the
      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of
      the Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must
      be a Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.

Contracts
  This Category includes Rules defining and regulating
  Contracts and Bearerbonds.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      Let there be a class of Organization known as a Contract, whose
      Compact can also be referred to as a Contract.

      A Contract consists only of Warranties, which are known as its
      Terms, the Players within its Jurisdiction are known as the
      Parties to the Contract, and the Administrator for all Contracts
      is the Notary.

      Contracts do not possess Treasuries, nor do they possess
      Executors.

      Contracts have the legal force to impose penalties upon Parties
      that do not abide by the Terms of the Contract.  Parties that
      are unwilling or unable to abide by the Terms are said to be in
      Breach of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify the following:

        i) What actions the parties to the contract are required to
           perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what
           conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
       ii) What penalties are imposed upon a party who Breaches the
           Contract.

      The Foundors of a Contract must be the set of all Parties to the
      Contract. In addition to what other Rules require them to
      provide to the Notary, the Foundors must also specify the
      following information:

       i) The identity of each Party to the Contract, each of whom
          must be named in the Terms of the Contract itself.

      Providing a unique Name for the Contract is optional, this takes
      precedence over the general requirements for information
      provided.  If no Name is provided, the Notary must provide a
      unique Name for the Contract and provide this Name to all
      Parties.  Parties can then change the Name as provided for in
      the Contract or in other Rules.

      A Contract is Private, and the Notary shall send a notification
      to all the Parties of a Contract As Soon As Possible after it
      has been legally  entered into.  The Contract shall be in force
      no sooner than the moment of that notification.

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in
      accordance with its Terms, or one or more of the Parties of the
      Contract ceases to  be a Player, or the Contract is breached as
      described elsewhere.

      When a Contract is changed (including any change in the Parties) a
      current Party to the Contract must inform the Notary of the
      change as soon as possible after it occurs.  If a Party is being
      added to, or removed from, the Contract, the change only has
      effect if _that_ Party sends the notification.  The Notary shall
      forward this notification of change to all current Parties of
      the Contract As Soon As Possible thereafter.

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an
      Organization is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      Any Organization which is not a Private Organization is a
      Public Organization.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may
      only be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a
           Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction, and the evidence
           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported
           to be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.

Rule 1456/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Definition and Penalties

      A Contract is Breached if any party to the Contract fails, for
      any reason, to perform any action required of em by the
      Contract, or performs, for any reason, any action prohibited of
      em by the Contract. A Breach is officially determined when the
      Notary finds a Player in Violation of the Contract's Terms, as
      described in other Rules.

      If a Party cannot fulfill the Terms of the Contract because to
      do so would  conflict with the Rules, e is required to Breach
      the Contract and must suffer the penalties for a Breach. (This
      applies even if other Rules absolve the Party from obeying the
      Terms.)

      The following shall take place in the event that a party of a
      Contract breaches that contract:

        i) 20 Marks shall be immediately transferred from the
           breaching Player to the Bank.
       ii) The breaching Player shall gain 3 Blots.
      iii) 30 Marks shall be divided as evenly as possible and
           transferred from the breaching Player to each of the other
           parties of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify additional penalties which are to be
      imposed in the event of a breach; however, such penalties shall
      be limited to the transfer of Currencies from the party who
      breached the Contract to any or all of the other Parties of the
      Contract.

      The Notary shall be responsible for reporting all Currency and
      Blot changes which arise as a result of this Rule.

      In the event of a breach, the Notary shall have the authority to
      order all specifically enumerated Currency transfers required by
      the Rules pertaining to Contracts and by the Contract which has
      been Breached. This authority is limited to ordering the
      transfer of Currencies from the Party in breach to the Bank
      and/or to other Parties of the Contract.

Rule 1457/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Breach of Contract: Judicial Procedure

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated
      text of the Compact, and the identity of the Violating Player.
      The Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute
      this information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Violated Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Administrator
      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any
      Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ
      shall lose 5 Marks to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected
      and reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization,
      if the Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor
      otherwise.

      times, exactly one Player is associated with each Role; the
      Player associated with a particular Role is known as the
      Rolebearer for that Role in that Bearerbond.

      When the Bearerbond is created, all Foundors must send the
      Notary a statement clearly identifying the initial Rolebearer
      for each Role in the Bearerbond.  All these statements must
      identify the same Rolebearers for the same Roles.

      All Rolebearers are Parties of the Bearerbond as long as they

      of the transaction, clearly indicating the unique abstract Role
      name, and the Name of the Bearerbond.

      The Rolebearer for any Role may be changed in this way at any
      time, unless the Terms of the Bearerbond state differently.

      When any Rolebearer in a Bearerbond changes, the Notary shall
      notify all Parties to that Bearerbond of the change, the Role
      involved, and the identity of the new Rolebearer.  This
      notification shall occur As Soon As Possible.  The change of
      Rolebearer takes effect when the Notary sends this notification.

i would have rather had one very large batch in place of one extremely
small and one just-about-as-large batch.  having two batches makes
Assessing more complex, as well as makes things annoying for the
Scorekeepor because of the anomalous timing of the various Point

imo, Wes should have Promoted 2057 along with 2058 thru 2287.

On the contrary. Blanket AGAINST is the only appropriate choice.

Once was amusing. Twice was an inconvenience. Three times was rather annoying.

Four times? This is too much. We must send a clear message, that, permitted or

Full Statement:

Rule 1023 shall be interpreted, such that for each action which a
Player is obliged to perform, but fails to perform, within the time
required by this Rule is a separate and distinct Crime, and
furthermore each action performed by a Player in an order which is
inconsistent with the requirements of this Rule is itself a Crime
separate and distinct from each other such action, and from any Crime
for failure to meet the time requirement.

Requested Injunction:

i bar nobody from this CFJ, and i request than an Injunction be issued
to annotate Rule 1023 with this Statement.  the list of Relevant Rules
is Rule 1023.

======================================================================

i bar nobody from this CFJ, and i request than an Injunction be issued
to annotate Rule 1023 with this Statement.  the list of Relevant Rules
is Rule 1023.

Argument:

it has never been well-established what it means to violate this Rule.
i am making this CFJ to try to establish a consistent judicial
precedent for the proper interpretation of Rule 1023.

i will not complicate the example by dealing with 1023's parallel duty
tracks; obviously, duties on different duty tracks are independent of
each other and can be performed in any order.  1023 gives every Player
one duty track for each Office e holds, plus one more for duties not
pertaining to any Office, so Officers have more leeway in ordering
their Moves.  all times in the following illustration are measured in
days, for simplicity.

let us presume, throughout, that at time T=0 a Player who holds no
Offices incurs a duty D0, at time T=1 e incurs another duty D1, and at
time T=5 e incurs a third duty D2.  let us now examine several
possible orderings and timings of fulfillment of these duties, and the
Crimes which would arise from these various orders.

of course, the "desired" order is to perform D0 no later than T=7, D1
no later than T=8, and D2 no later than T=12, and such that D0 is
performed before D1 and D1 performed before D2.

first, let us approach order: if the duties are discharged in the
order D0,D1,D2, there are no Crimes for ordering.  if they are
discharged in the order D1,D0,D2 the order D0,D2,D1, or the order
D2,D0,D1, there is one Crime (because there is only a single action
taken out of order).  if they are discharged in the order D2,D1,D0 or
the order D1,D2,D0 then there are two Crimes, because D0 was
unfulfilled at the time that both D1 and D2 were performed.  each
Violation consists of performing a properly subsequent duty while one
or more properly precedent duties remain unfulfilled.

the case of timing is simpler: the failure to perform a duty before
the latest time permitted (that is, seven days, except when another
Rule specifies, in which case this Rule has no bearing) is a Crime.
so, in the above example, if the Player does not fulfill duty D0 before
time T=7, e commits a Crime, regardless of when e performed duties D1
or D2.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Decision: FALSE

Reasoning: My interpretation of this rule is that a crime is committed for
           each out-of-order action.  Thus, using the Caller's example an
           order of D2, D0, D1 would be two crimes, not the one crime the
           Caller claims, since both D0 and D1 are required to precede D2.
           Similarly, an order of D2, D1, D0 would be three crimes, not the
           two Caller claims; the two crimes for D2 preceding D0 and D1 plus
           one for D1 preceding D0.



======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

In the matter of the Appeal of CFJ 835, I overturn Bowen's Judgement
of FALSE and Judge the Statement TRUE.

This has been a most curious CFJ! In fact I accept something very
close, perhaps even identical, to Judge Bowen's analysis, and reject
Kelly's analysis.  Yet Judge Bowen's argument seems to me to clearly
support a finding of TRUE, while I find that Kelly's actual argument
misanalyzes R1023. A must curious state of affairs.

To sum up what follows, I shall argue that Bowen, and Kelly in her 
Statement (but not her arguments), are correct that a Crime is
committed for each out of order action. I shall argue with Bowen,
and against Kelly, that the ordering D2, D0, D1 represents 2 Crimes
and not 1. And finally, I shall argue against both Kelly and Bowen
that these Crimes are committed not when D2 is performed (as
Bowen later claimed he meant), but when D0 and D1 is performed.
I shall argue that the performance of D2 is not actually a Crime
at all!  Although this is an unsatisfactory state of affairs, showing
the need for an amendment to R1023 (described below), that is what
R1023 actually says.

My analysis focuses on the ordering D2, D0, D1. It will help to have
before us once again the relevant part of R1023:

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then: 

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to 
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no later than any other 
           action which the performance of the duties of that 
           Office subsequently requires em to perform;

      Failure to observe these time requirements is a Class D Crime.


The key phrases are: "...the Player is required to perform the
action...no *later* than any other action which [e is] *subsequently*
require[d] to perform." Because of the use of the words "later" and
"subsequently", I call this the 'LS formulation'.

Now think again about the ordering D2, D0, D1. In this case, has D2
been performed *later* than any other action *subsequently* required
to be performed? No! In the first place, D2 was the *last* of the
requirements to be incurred, so there *is* no action subsequently
required to be performed which D2 has been performed later than. And
in the second place, D2 is performed *first* in the series, so there
are no other actions in the example which it can be performed later
than. In fact, the only way the performance of D2 could be a Crime is
if it were performed later than the performance of some hypothetical
D3 which it was supposed to be performed prior to. Since that
situation does not obtain in the example, the performance of D2 out
of order is not a Crime.

When, then, is the Crime committed? Look at D0. Has *it* been performed
later than some action that was subsequently required to be performed?
Yes it has! It has been performed later than D2, which we stipulated
became required to be performed after D0. So the performance of D0
is a Crime. The same goes for D1, which has also been performed later
than D2. So, in the example, 2 Crimes are committed, one when D0 is
performed, and one when D1 is performed.

But, looking back at Kelly's Statement, this is precisely what that
Statement alleges! Kelly's Statement alleges two things:

1) ...each action which a Player is obliged to perform, but fails to
perform, within the time required by this Rule is a separate and
distinct Crime, 

2) ...each action performed by a Player in an order which is
inconsistent with the requirements of this Rule is itself a Crime
separate and distinct from each other such action, and from any Crime
for failure to meet the time requirement.

About (1) there seems to be no disagreement. We've been discussing
(2). In the case of the ordering D2, D0, D1, the only actions which
are in fact inconsistent with the requirements of R1023 are D0 and D1,
and lo and behold, the performance of each of these actions is itself
a separate and distinct Crime. So Kelly's Statement is TRUE, despite
the bad argument she gave for it, and despite Bowen's Judgement of
FALSE, delivered in spite of the good argument he gave for its truth!
Bizarre.

That takes care of the Judicial matters, but more is left to do. Clearly,
the current wording of R1023, ie the LS formulation, is inadequate.
This is so because in a case like the one above, we actually *want*
there to be just one Crime, committed when D2 is performed. Otherwise,
we run into oddities, even absurdities. After D2 is performed, we already
know that an ordering Crime has been committed (or rather, will be
committed when D0 is performed), but as things stand we have to wait
until D0 is performed before we know when the Crime is committed.
This is silly. What can be done about it?

The answer will, I think, surprise. It certainly surprised me! I
propose to replace the LS formulation with what I call the EA
formulation, ie replace "later" with "earlier" and "subsequently"
with "already". That would mean R1023 would read like this:

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform;

This actually enforces exactly the same partial ordering on requirements
as before - and gives the right answer in the D2, D0, D1 case. Performance
of D2 in this scenario is now a Crime (as it should be), since it is the
performance of an action earlier than the performance of other actions
(D0 and D1), which are already required to be performed. To see that it
makes sense more generally, consider the simpler case of rerquirements to
perform actions D1 and D2, incurred in that order, but performed in the
reverse order D2, D1.

Again, I think it's clear that in this case, we ought to tie the time
of commission of the Crime to the time of commission of D2. But under
the LS formulation, it's the performance of D1 that's the Crime, since
only D1 has been performed *later* than an action *subsequently* required
to be performed. The EA formulation gets the right answer, since D2 has
been performed *earlier* than some action *already* required to be
performed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I uphold the Judge's original decision of FALSE, although through another
reasoning.

The first thing we should do is look closely at Rule 1023. In what case is the
Crime, described in this Rule committed? Reading the Rule, it says: "[...]the
Player is required to perform the action within a week, and no later than any
other action e is subsequently required to perform which (...)" (the wording
of part (ii). Part (i) is not fundamentally different).

So the crime is committed if a Player does NOT perform the action e is
required to perform within a week, and no later than any other action e is
subsequently required to perform etcetera. That is, if something which is
required later is done earlier, the Crime consists of not doing the second
thing before the first one.

I think I am more clear if I make an example like the Caller has done, but
this time a simpler one with only two actions, D0 and D1, of which the
obligation to do D0 came before D1, and D0 should be done ASAP. If now D1 is
done first, a Crime has been commited of the type defined in Rule 1023.

At first I thought this would, as Steve argues, make the Crime happen only
when D0 is performed, but looking back, that is not the case. The Crime namely
is NOT the fact that D1 has been done before D0 (or D0 after D1) in itself,
the Crime is that D0 has not been done before D1. And this is something which
is indeed the case at the time (or, in fact, an infinitesimally time later)
D1 is performed.

However, let's now look at the situations described by the Caller.

Order D0, D1, D2: No Crime. I suppose anyone would agree.
Order D1, D0, D2: One Crime, namely failure to do D0 before D1.
Order D0, D2, D1: One Crime, failure to do D1 before D2.
Order D2, D0, D1: Two Crimes: Failure to do D0 before D2, failure to do D1
  before D2.
Order D2, D1, D0: Two Crimes: Failure to do D0 before D2, failure to do D1
  before D2. There is also a failure to do D0 before D1, but the failure to
  do D0 before D1 and the failure to do D0 before D2 are one Crime, namely
  the failure to do D0 before any other action (which etc.) which the Player
  is subsequently required to perform.
Order D1, D2, D0: One Crime. As above, it might be said there are two failures,
  but they make only one Crime.

So, now let's get back to the Statement of the CFJ. What I don't agree with is
the second part: "...and furthermore each action performed by a Player in an
order which is inconsistent with the requirements of this Rule is itself a
Crime separate and distinct from each other such action", and the thirth part
"...and from any Crime for failure to meet the time requirement.

The second part is clearly nonsense. If it were TRUE, then the order D1, D0
of my 'simple' case would already be two Crimes, which I think hardly anyone
would argue. To be more clear: D0 and D1 are both out of order, so according
to the Statement of the CFJ they would both be a Crime.

The tirth part is also FALSE in my opinion, although I can imagine I change
my opinion here. The case we are talking about is this: D0 is now not only
done after D1, but also more than a week after the obligation to do it started.
In my opinion there is still only one Crime, namely the failure to do it
'within a week, and no later than any other action which...'. It could be
argued that this are 2 Crimes though, namely 1 for failure to D0 within a week,
and another for failure to do it 'no later than...'

======================================================================

Evidence:
  Rule 1023/5 (added by CotC)


Rule 1023/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then: 

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to 
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no later than any other 
           action which the performance of the duties of that 
           Office subsequently requires em to perform;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week, 
           and no later than any other action e is subsequently 
           required to perform which is not an action performed
           in the course of carrying out Official duties.

      Failure to observe these time requirements is a Class D Crime. 
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.

For your convenience I have here an overview of the various opinions of the
the Caller and the Judges of this CFJ on the number of Crimes for the
D0-D1-D2-case:

order performed:	number of Crimes according to:
			Caller	Judge	Justic.	CotC
			Kelly	Dave	Steve	Andre
D0-D1-D2		0	0	0	0
D0-D2-D1		1	1	1	1
D1-D0-D2		1	1	1	1
D1-D2-D0		2	2	2	1
D2-D0-D1		1	2	2	2
D2-D1-D0		2	3	3?	2
When Crime in D1-D0?	at D1?	at D0?	at D0	at D1

The question marks show places where I could only guess the Caller's, Judges or
Justiciar's point of view.

You almost convince me to cast a blanket vote FOR, KoJen.

If blanket repeals were proposed every week, I might agree.  But
as far apart as they are, there is significant change in the
Ruleset between them, and they deserve our fair consideration.

I don't think a blanket against vote is honorable, but I probably
wouldn't have deKudoed for it.  *This*, however, is utterly
indefensible--how can you propose this now, when in the very
same message you voted against a Proposal (namely, 2209) to do
exactly the same thing???!!!

---
Benefactors

Create a Rule with this text (Benefactors) :

   There exists a Patent Title of Benefactor, which is automatically 
   awarded to any Player who posts a set of Proposals such that, 
   first, each Proposal has as its effect if adopted the Repeal of 
   exactly one Rule; second, that each Rule in the Ruleset is 
   mentioned in one of these Proposals; third, that all these 
   Proposals are submitted in the same Nomic Week.

   This Rule respawns itself on a Repeal.
---

Comments : Chromatic Repeals are a Good Thing or a Bad Thing, 
depending on one's point of view; this has the advantage of correctly 
reflecting both opinions, in establishing a Title which is either a 
form of praise or heavy irony, depending on which side you're on. :)

Y'all may remember that I was a very vocal proponent of the blanket 
AGAINST on the Green Repeals. Everyone will appreciate, I think, 
that I find the above argument one thousand percent convincing and 
that I now urge everyone to carefully consider which of the Repeals 
they would like to pass.

Also, once again, do we all simultaneously Win the Game in a few 
days?

Why the hell not ? It gives the RS a good shake-up, and one Win and a 
couple hundred Marks are not to be spat upon...

> Proposal

I know this is perfectly legal, but since I do not see any relation 
between this and the gist of the rest of your message, would these 
Proposals not have been better submitted in a separate post ?

Not that I disagree; on the contrary, The Virus was foremost in my 
list of FOR Repeals. :)

Respawning

Create a Rule with this text (Respawning) :

   Any Rule may specify that it respawns itself. This shall be a 
   clear and unambiguous way of referring to the process whereby, an 
   infinitesimal amount of time before any Rule Change which Repeals 
   such a Rule takes effect, the affected Rule creates, in the manner of a 
   non-Proposed Rule Change, a new Rule with the exact text of the 
   Repealed Rule, and further that, an infinitesimal amount of time 
   after such a Repeal takes effect, the newly-created Rule changes 
   its own Rule Number to that of the most recently Repealed Rule. 
   These amounts of time shall be smaller than any other amount of 
   time referred to in other Rules.

   If a Proposal contains both an amendment to an existing Rule and 
   the Repeal of a Rule with the same Rule Number, the Repeal shall 
   take effect first if the Proposal is adopted; this takes precedence
   over any Rule specifying a different ordering for the effects of a 
   Proposal.

   This Rule respawns itself.
---

Comments : my attempt at 'elite' Rules. This lets us have a way 
of specifically protecting some Rules against blanket Repeals. Note 
that Repeals in general, and even blanket Repeals, remain feasible, 
but require two Proposals instead of one; the first to amend 
respawning out of the Rule, the second to actually Repeal the Rule.

You are lucky, I just resubscribed to nomic-discussion. Otherwise I wouldn't
have seen this message, so this transfer wouldn't have been effective either.

_Excuse_ me? I have not made any attempt to go through the Ruleset 
looking for repealable Rules, and I had no intention to do so until a 
Proposal was made. I figured 10 days would be more than enough time.

However, you _had_ to do this less than a week before I leave for my
Christmas vacation. For this, Mir. Herald, I transfer one Kudo from
Zefram, to Kelly, who has to Assess all of this. 

I then, Ms. Assessor, vote AGAINST all of 2058-2257. I will not consider 
changing these Votes.

Furiously,
Oerjan.

AGAINST.  why?  because this Proposal is identical in every respect
with Proposal 2209, except it wasn't proposed by you.  you've already
voted against this Proposal, yet you are now Proposing it yourself.

if you want to repeal the Virus, vote FOR 2209.  if you don't, vote
AGAINST 2209.  voting against 2209 and then advocating a Proposal to
do the exact same thing is sheer pigheadedness.

Most Honourable Herald: if i have a Kudo transfer left this week, i
use it to transfer from Kudo from KoJen, for voting against a Proposal
and then eirself Proposing the exact same Proposal, in the same
message (and also for casting a blanket AGAINST vote), to Ian, for the
temerity to propose another round of the Chromatic Repeals.

personally, i would appreciate that everyone give these Proposals due
consideration.  it is a waste of my time to Assess tem (and Wes' time
in Promoting them) if everyone casts blanket votes.  however, if the
votes are reasonably considered, then my time has not been wasted
because the results will actually represent something more than just
kneejerk reactionism.

Steve and i may not because our Win Threshholds are so high.
otherwise, though, yes, i believe so.

of course, things may get complicated, depending on what Rules are
repealed.  however, since Points for Voting are awarded at the end of
the VP (and thus before any of the Proposals takes effect), everyone
who votes on all 230 Proposals will get 230 Points for Christmas.

No, it's not pigheadedness, it's innocent confusion.

I was not aware of a Proposal 2209. You say I voted AGAINST it. That is very
likely true, but I cannot find this in my records. And, if it does exactly what
mine does and only that, I have no idea why I would have Voted AGAINST it. As
you should know, I am not playing at the highest level of participation, but
this does not mean that I shouldn't be allowed to send a Proposal now and then.

My offer to anyone who agrees that the Virus Rule should be eliminated: Vote
FOR both Proposals: 2209 and mine. I will be happy to transfer all resulting
rewards to the original Author, as soon as someone tells me who it is. I did
not intend to steal the idea.


Mir Herald,

I transfer one Kudo FROM Kelly (for using the insulting word "pigheadedness"
and not bothering to get eir facts straight) TO Michael (for eir continuing
efforts to keep the X Group active).

no, it's pigheadedness; if you didn't let your pigheaded attitude

this is horseshit.  you know damned well that 2209 is one of Zefram's

you tell that 2209 is within the range 2058 to 2287?  you cast your

With the huge volumes of discussion that things like Kelly's or

maybe we should have a nomic-scams or nomic-crisis list ? ;)

Proto-Proposal
(WAS : The Mutant)
---
Genetics (1 Creation, 1 Directive, 1 Repeal)

Create a Rule with this text (Genetics):

     There is a Rule known as The Mutant, whose number is known as the
     Number of the Beast. A Directive to determine the Number of the
     Beast is legal, and uniquely identifies The Mutant. If at any
     time there is no Number of the Beast associated with an existing
     Rule, this Rule has no effect.

   As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the 
   Rulekeepor shall randomly select :
    - in an English language dictionary of eir choice, one page 
      containing dictionary entries,
    - one entry on that page,
    - one word of The Mutant.

   The Mutant shall then be modified in the manner of a non-Proposed
   Amendment by replacing the selected word with the word or words
   corresponding to the selected entry of the dictionary, if and only if
   the replacement does not result in a sentence that is ungrammatical
   after properly conforming the replacement word or words to the
   grammatical attributes (tense, person, gender, number) of the
   word it replaces.

   These Rule Changes take effect upon publication by the Rulekeepor 
   of the results of this procedure, which shall take place within 24 
   hours of the procedure being applied.

Directive : set the Number of the Beast to 1061.

Rule 1454 is Repealed.    
---

Comments : it should be much more interesting to see how a Rule 
Mutates than to simply Repeal it. This can be used as torture for 
Rules we dislike particularly. :)

Revision history :

1- 15 Nov., original proto
2 - 1 Dec., added Repeal of the Virus
3 - 6 Dec., Minor fixes, spelcheking
4 - 12 Dec.
Changed Rule Title to avoid confusion with The Mutant.
Simplified description of the selection process.
Clarified grammatical 'equivalence'.
5 - 14 Dec.
Unmathified random selection.
The RS now changes only when the changes are published.
6 - 15 Dec.
The NotB now refers to a Rule Number.

Well, now that you bring this to my attention, I see that 2209 is indeed in the
range 2058-2287. But I didn't notice this before. I don't tend to think of
Proposals by number. 

Again, Kelly, you are using insulting language which is not deserving. A simple
misunderstanding is all. I don't lie. I don't appreciate this kind of abusive
language. 


> because you don't think (for more than a few seconds) about how you

It took only a few seconds to realize that this was another round of Blanket
Repeals, and therefore in need of little further attention. My position on the
next Blanket Repeals was stated the last time these were Proposed.

I stated that I would Vote AGAINST any group of Blanket Repeals, regardless of
content, and gave defensible reasons for doing so. Of course, I would have
Voted FOR 2209 if it had been Proposed in isolation. But the right thing to do
about a Blanket Repeal is to send a clear unambiguous message that this is a
Bad Thing.

I call upon the Electorate not to lose sight of the fact that Kudo Wars are
never a good idea. But I think most of us know that already.
