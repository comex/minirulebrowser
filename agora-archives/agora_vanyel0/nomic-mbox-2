The two are *NOT* the same.  I wholeheartedly support the right
to free speech, both within this Game and in Real Life.

I am more or less neutral on the use of anon servers.  But let me
point out that anyone who runs an anon service, such as the one
at anon.penet.fi, will tell you that it is a privilege and not
a right.

They are currently dangerous because they are unregulated.  Kelly's
proposals would fix that.  If you believe they would still be
dangerous, please provide an example, rather than a vague
"Danger, Will Robinson!"

As for complexity, it has been pointed out before that this is no
more complex than several other parts of the Rules.  As an aside,
I note that my props 1264-1267 were (IMO) an equally good and
simpler solution.  However, since these were rejected by the Agora
community, for whatever reason, I am supporting Kelly's efforts.

I have yet to see a convincing argument as to why we should prohibit
ourselves non-proposed Rule Changes.

Similar things have been suggested in the past.  The main problem
is that the precedence claims which would be needed are almost impossible
to work out properly.  Another problem is that prohibiting CFJ's,
at any time, is IMO *very, very* dangerous.  What if someone
believes we are *not* on Vacation, and tries to submit a CFJ
to that effect?  What if someone mentions a convincing argument
that we can never come off vacation, and no CFJ can be made on that?

Around the time that this was discussed, it was generally agreed
that the best way to do holidays was by an increase of quorum
(it was originally 20% of Voters.)  With the current
Quorum rules, if 65% of players are On Hold (and do not
vote), no legislation can be passed.  I think this is sufficient.

i have not and will not support any attempt to limit Proposals or any
attempt to dictate the specific timing of their distribution, except
insofar as to make such distribution timely.  i oppose the
institutionalization of the informal policies i have adopted to guide
my own Speakership: they are convenient to me, but may prove
unsuitable for some other Speaker.

i'm a triple officer, true, but being Speaker has nothing to do with
it.  the Speaker is not an Officer.  my third Office is Reform Group
Ordinancekeepor, a largely meaningless position.

other triples are KoJen (Registrar, Abelian Viz, Abelian O/K) and
Chuck (Ambassador, RuleKeepor, and VAVAVAVOOM! Viz).  elJefe would
_not_ be a triple if e accpted the post of CotC, as e is currently

Just to let everyone know, I'll be gone for almost a week around
Thanksgiving.  I'll be leaving early Wednesday morning, but
I have a lot to do before then, so I may not log in again before I
leave.  I'll be back Monday evening (both of these U.S. times).

I choose *not* to go On Hold during this period.

I'll post a Ruleset shortly, before I leave, since I haven't posted
one yet this Nomic Week.

I do not accept the lack of arguments for NPRC's as a valid reason
to prohibit them, nor the argument that we have not had that many
in the past.

By analogy: in our 1.5 years of play, we have never had a Player
from Hawaii.  Nor have I seen any convincing arguments for allowing
people from Hawaii to play.  Therefore we should forbid anyone from
Hawaii from joining????!!!

well, i expect it will slow down somewhat for the next month or so.
i'm fresh out of proposals and new ideas right now.  of course, it's
possible the economists may well take up the slack.

Perhaps we ought to bring back my old idea of Nomic Periods--
durning one week Vote and Judge CFJ's, during the other
make Proposals and CFJ's.

i think it's pretty damn well established that multiplicative
operators are generally considered to have precedence over additive
operators.  unless you happen to drive a double-decker bus that runs
only in reverse and is instrumented in greek.

we can kill two birds with one stone by making the F-A award be
multiplied by the number of Rule Changes in the Proposal.  a Proposal
which has no Rule Changes gets no F-A; a Proposal with several will
get an F-A equal to what it would have gotten if each had been
proposed individually.

also note the third paragraph.  precisely what Score change is the

anywhere else in the Proposal.

i'm please that TaL adopted my phrasing for the double-jeopardy clause
(i struggled with that for some time to find a phrasing that did what
i wanted).  i would recommend the following as a replacement for the
first paragraph:

"No Call for Judgement shall be made alleging that a given Move
violates a given Rule, if a prior Call for Judgement also alleges that
the Move in question violated that same Rule, or if the Move in
question was made more than ten days prior to the Call for Judgement,
or if the Player making the Call for Judgement is the same Player that
made the Move in question."

P.SA., no, I'm not in SLOWDOWN!, although I do admit that the change of

Hang on a tic, KoJen.

Now, while I personally would not have transferred a kudo from you for
this, if you read Kelly's reasons carefully you will see that she
is not transferring a Kudo from you becuase she suspects you of
being the anonymous poster. The transfer is for *defending the actions*
of the anonymous poster, whoever e is.

You misread kelly's post. The reason cited for the transfer is *not*
for "being the anonymous poster", but for "failing to see
the inherent dishonour in posting anonymously" - on other words,
for defending the right to post anonymously. Now, I don't agree
with kelly on this issue, but I won't allow you and KoJen to falsely
accuse her of starting a witchhunt, either. That really would be
dishonourable.

I'm a little troubled by the looseness of the wording in the first paragraph.
The first sentence mentions CFJs that allege that a Move is a Violation.
Very well. But the second sentence then introduces this new talk of
"accusations". It is not clear enough for my liking that these are
the same as the "allegations" you mention earlier. At the moment, the
Rule could plausibly be interpreted to mean that no-one may suggest even
in the Public Forum that a Violation may have taken place, if the
Violation took place more than 10 days previously. That isn't your
intent obviously.

what you are proposing is a _mandatory_ guideline for distribution.
my policy is _advisory_: i can override it if i feel it would be in
the best interest of Agora to do so.  since i cannot "ask unanimous
consent that the rules be suspended" (as i would be able to in an
actual parliamentary forum) i am loath to mandate guidelines which
should, IMO, be merely advisory.

if you are going away for a vacation of more than one week but less

is _really_ impacted by this is the Speaker.  since i have no plans to
be away for more than a day or so i am not concerned. :)

"corymbose" is an adjective, meaning "consisting of or resembling
corymbs".

"viyella" does not appear in my dictionary; this does not mean it is
not a word.

"Ozymandius" is the name of a mythological king.  if this is not a
word, than neither is "Kunne".

"wheyface" is a noun, meaning "a face white or plae, as from terror or
fright, or a person with such a face." 

in any case, i do not believe this is relevant.  this CFJ uses a form
of argument that i find particularily distasteful, called "arguing
from the dictionary".  dictionaries are not necessarily complete or
accurate representations of the language, and (as any good English
teacher will tell you) one cannot possibly hope to fully understand
the meaning of a word solely from its dictionary definition.  i
personally believe it is quite clear that "viyella" is a word (albeit
possibly a "nonsense" word), under the common-sense usage of the word
"word".  

also, it seems to meet with def'n 2 as provided in the CFJ: it is the
graphic representation of a series of sounds that presumably could
communicate a meaning.  the fact that Ronald Kunne is not able to
determine the meaning of the series of sounds thus represented does
not in any way deprive that series of sounds from possibly bearing
meaning.

i could also go into a long diatribe on the use-mention distinction,
here, but will not.

Well... I think it *might* pass, as is, but I'm not particularly fond of
trying to pass this under your nose.  However, the fact that around half
of us think it's ok makes me think that we have good chances that the next
Speaker would disagree.  However, if someone can post a better argument
than "it *might* be inconvenient for someone, but we don't know for sure"
I would definitely modify appropriately.  Because really, for Kelly it
*is* convenient (as she herself admitted), and if it passes, then it would
be convenient or at least supported by *half* the posible Speakers.  That
makes me not feel guilty about "passing things under the Speaker's nose"
as much...

assuming a uniform discrete random variable X with n values and N
samples, each discrete value of X is expected to occur N/n times.  a
chi-square test can be devised to see if the sample is indeed random.

for this distribution, all the F_i are the same: N/n, and all their
probabilities are the same, 1/n.  the test is to compute the relative
squared residual for each value of X [that is (f_i - F_i)^2/F_i] and
sum them.  if this sum is greater than the chi-square test statistic
for the desired alpha-risk and distribution parameters, the
distribution is not random.

for n=11 and 1-alpha=.9 (90% confidence), the chi-square test
statistic would be \chi_2(.90;10) = 15.99.

As they are, I am rather unhappy with them. I remind you that you

So... what all would this affect?  If it's just Apology requests and
one or two directives, fine, but if *anywhere* in the Rules it phrases
things as "and then the Player must submit eir Proposal", then this 
Proto is seriously flawed.

No KoJen actually, but I can hardly say that in public, lest he will
protest. I, myself, was last on my own list. Apart from the possibility
that I have a double personality, I am pretty sure that I didn't post it
myself.

Too bad, I didn't. (As I seem to be the less sensitive to Kudo transfers.)

On top of that: actually this guy (these guys) do(es) make sense.
Kelly is spending enormous amounts of Points as fees to rush these Proposals.

If I counted correctly she has now 16 Proposals Up for Vote:
maybe she has a plane to catch?

Attn scorekeepor: Judge Steve receives 5 Points for a Speedy Judgment.

+-----------------------------------------------+
| CFJ Statement:                                |
+-----------------------------------------------+
In issuing the Injunction on CFJ 717, Judge Vlad violated Rule 663.

I note that if this is judged TRUE, the Judge must issue an
Injunction for a Formal Apology as per Rule 908.
+--------------------------------------------+
| Judge Steve's Reasoning for Judgment TRUE: |
+--------------------------------------------+
In the matter of CFJ 724, I judge TRUE. Chuck's argument is logical:
the Injunction requested with CFJ 717 was not one of legally mandated
types of Injunction.  Therefore, Vlad did act illegally in issuing an
Injunction.  By Rule 908 I am therefore required to issue an Injunction
of my own requiring Vlad to submit a Formal Apology. The Prescribed Words
for this Formal Apology are: corymbose, viyella, Ozymandius, wheyface,
kibitzer, rehoboam, menhir, repaginate, zeugma, sussurate.
+-----------------------+
| Requested Injunction: |
+-----------------------+
I note that if this is judged TRUE, the Judge must issue an
Injunction for a Formal Apology as per Rule 908.
+-------------+
| Injunction: |
+-------------+
By Rule 908 I am therefore required to issue an Injunction of my 
own requiring Vlad to submit a Formal Apology. The Prescribed Words
for this Formal Apology are: corymbose, viyella, Ozymandius, wheyface,
kibitzer, rehoboam, menhir, repaginate, zeugma, sussurate.
+-------------------------+
| Judge Steve's Comments: |
+-------------------------+
I should like to note formally that Vlad is not to be held entirely
responsible for this misdemeanor. Some of the blame must fall to me,
for it was I who requested the Injunction of the illegal type in CFJ
717. His assumption that my requested Injunction was a legal one
was not unreasonable. I should therefore like to apolgize to Vlad
for having let him, albeit accidentally, into this trap.

I therefore direct the Herald: please transfer 1 kudo 
FROM Steve, for having led Vlad into making an illegal Move,
TO   Vlad, in reparation for the damage to his reputation so caused.
+------------+
| Arguments: |
+------------+
Vlad's issued an Injunction "cancelling any point penalties
incurred by Steve under Rule 659 as the result of the submission of
Proposal 1319."

Rule 663 states that an Injunction is legal only if specifically
permitted elsewhere in the Rules.  The Injunction issued by Vlad
is *not* so permitted, and thus in violation of Rule 663.

There are three specific types of Injunction allowed: a) by Rule 665,
an Injunction retracting an illegal move.  While this CFJ might
at first look like it alleges that an illegal move has been committed,
it does not.  It alleges that Steve does not incur a certain penalty.
It does *not* allege that anyone reported that Steve had incurred
this penalty, and thus merely makes a statement about the Game State;
it does *not* allege that an illegal move took place.  b) by Rule 789,
an Injunction on the interpretation of a Rule.  Such Injunctions are
limited to an annotation on the Rule, which this Injunction clearly
is not.  c) by Rule 908, a Formal Apology.  This Injunction is clearly
not an Injunction for a Formal Apology.  Since Vlad's Injunction
was not "specifically permitted elsewhere in the Rules," it is in
violation of Rule 663.

+-----------------------+
| Rules and Precedents: |
+-----------------------+
Rule 663 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 665 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

Rule 789 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in

      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Rule 908 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

"In Rule 1042 the phrase `unless that Voter specifically asks the

| Requested Injunction: |
+-----------------------+
I note that according to Rule 789, the Judge may issue an Injunction
if e Judges that my interpretation of the English idiom is the
correct one.
+------------+
| Arguments: |
+------------+
The problem I have, is a problem of understanding the English idiom.
The whole sentence is as follows:

 Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
 of the following conditions applies:
   -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
    Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
    Voter specifically asks the Registrar to remain registered;

Basically this has the form:
`A Voter who doesn't do X has forfeited, unless e asks not to.'

The Registrar currently has the practice to accept that players may
request not to be deregistered, long time before they seemingly
disappear. However, the Rule is made to protect the community from
disappearing Players. Accepting such requests *before* a disappearance
goes Against the Spirit of that idea.

And if we really had wanted that effect, then the sentence should have
been  phrased with a perfect tense:

 Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
 of the following conditions applies:
   -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
    Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
    Voter specifically has asked the Registrar to remain registered;
                       ^^^^^^^^^
which has the form:
`A Voter who doesn't do X has forfeited, unless e has asked not to.'

Rule 789 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Rule 1042 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration Due to Inactivity

      Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
      of the following conditions applies:
        -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
         Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
         Voter specifically asks the Registrar to remain registered;
        -a Voter is On Hold for a period exceeding 2 months.

      If a former Player re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the
      same score as when e left and e shall not be considered a new
      Player.  Otherwise, e shall enter on the same terms as a new
      Player.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule leaving forfeiture of a
      Player entirely in the hands of that Player.

I took into account Steve's and Oerjan's suggestions.
I do not want to extend the exclusion to all Directives.
For instance, if a Player wants to change an Officer, the Proposal
should cost something if it fails. Otherwise, we might be swamped
by them.

proto-PROPOSAL
Reward or Penalty for Proposing
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 833 to read:
"When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
 (2*F)-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the
 number of votes AGAINST.  However, only the Votes of Voters
 shall be counted for this determination.
 This Rule shall not be applied for Proposals that Players submit,
 because a Rule (or Rules) require them to do so.

To allow for the fact that certain holidays take almost everybody away
from Nomic, I proto the following:

Proto-PROPOSAL
Nomic Holidays

Any Player may Propose a Holiday Directive.  It will specify a certain
period of time for a Nomic Holiday.  If the Directive passes with an
Adoption Index of 1 or greater, Nomic business shall not be conducted
during that period, and when determining time limits such as those 
specified by "as soon as possible" or the 14-day deregistration limit,
this time is considered not to have passed.  All discussion can, of
course, continue.
***

Obviously, we can declare Nomic Holidays whenever we want; Michael
Norrish Day, in honor of the First Speaker, etc.  But the main reason
is that we can basically omit certain days such as Christmas (and
maybe a few days before and after), New Year's, probably none of
the national holidays (like I said, Thanksgiving isn't a big deal),
but I think you get the idea.

Vanyel

I don't like it. Why artificially jump back and forth between those two
"periods"?

However, Officers are not allowed to go on Hold.  On Hold and Quorum are
fine for, say, the summer break.  But for Christmas and stuff it might
be handy.  Oh well, whatever.

This has been proposed over and over again, in different forms.
It never passed.
The reason is that we don't need it, as we already have Quorum Rules
and On Hold Rules.

If players go away, they should go On Hold. That's why we have that Rule.
If the number of Players dwindle below the Quorum, then business will
stop automatically. That's why we have *that* Rule.

Directives

Rule 993 shall be amended to read:

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if

      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which

Proposal 1334 PASSES 16-7 (0)
Patent Titles

Rule 649 shall be amended to read:

      Let there be a Nomic Entity known as a Patent Title.  A
      Player may nominate a person for a Patent Title by means of a
      Directive awarding the Title to that Person.  Such a Directive
      must clearly specify the Patent Title, and the person to whom it

      been granted.

This Proposal shall not take effect unless Proposal 1330 is adopted.

Proposal 1335 PASSES 13-10 (0)
Unique Patent Titles

Rule 1044 shall be amended to read:

      There shall be a subset of Patent Titles known as Unique Patent
      Titles.  A Unique Patent Title is awarded to a single person, at
      the same time as the creation of the Unique Patent Title; no
      other person may ever hold that Patent Title.  The Registrar
      shall record all Unique Patent Titles and the people to whom
      they are awarded.

      A Unique Patent Title is created and awarded by a Directive to
      award the Unique Patent Title to the specified Player.  Such a
      Directive shall clearly state the Unique Patent Title to be
      awarded, that said Title is Unique, and the person who shall
      receive the Unique Title.  The Proposal containing such a
      Directive shall have an Adoption Index of at least 1.

This Proposal shall not take effect unless Proposal 1330 is adopted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 1336 PASSES 17-6 (0)
Defaults for Officers

Rule 1006 shall be amended to read:

      An Officer is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.

      install that Player into the Office.  The Proposal containing
      such a Directive shall have an Adoption Index of at least 1.

      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.

      replace eim, the Player thus proposed will by eis Successor.

      An Officer shall be appointed only if e consents.

      Rules for specific Offices.

This Proposal shall not take effect unless Proposal 1330 is adopted.

Proposal 1337 PASSES 12-8 (3)
Putting Oneself on Hold

the first paragraph shall be inserted the sentence "A Player may not
place any other Player besides emself on Hold."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 1338 PASSES 18-0 (5)
Deregistration Dut To Inactivity

Replace Rule 1042 with:

A Voter is deregistered when one of the following conditions applies:

   (i) E is not On Hold, has not previously asked the Registrar to
       remain registered, and has not, for 14 consecutive calendar
       days, either sent a message to the Public Forum, or sent a
       message to another Player of a kind which the Rules require to
       be recorded in a Report which becomes publically available.

  (ii) E is On Hold for a period exceeding 2 months. 

However, the above conditions do not cause deregistration until the
condition which would cause deregistration is brought to the attention
of the Registrar in a message to the Public Forum, correctly noting
that the Voter is subject to deregistration. The Registrar must
publicly verify the correctness of the claim to the best of eir
ability, as soon as possible. The Voter is deregistered at the time
the message correctly claiming deregistration appears on the Public
Forum. If the Registrar does not respond within one Week, then e is
considered negligent and the Speaker shall make the verification and
announcement instead.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule leaving deregistration of a
Player entirely in the hands of that Player.

{Comments: Cleans up and disambiguates the deregistration procedure,
as discussed over the past few weeks. In response to majority
preference, changed the time of deregistration to be the time it is
first publicly noticed, *not* when the Registrar confirms it. Also,
made the Speaker the backup confirmer in the Registrar's absence,
instead of the Archivist.}

"By his choice of Prescribed Words in issuing the Injunction on CFJ 724,
Judge Steve violated Rule 908."
+-----------------------+
| Requested Injunction: |
+-----------------------+
+------------+
| Arguments: |
+------------+
Note, that as long as this CFJ is pending, by Rule 663 Vlad is not
required to obey the Injunction with CFJ 724. I quote:

"All players must abide by
 the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
 publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
 [...]
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ."

Steve prescribed the following series of character strings to
be used in Vlad's Formal Apology: corymbose, viyella, Ozymandius,
wheyface, kibitzer, rehoboam, menhir, repaginate, zeugma, sussurate.

The problem is that some of these clearly are not words.
What is a word?
My online dictionary gives seven different definitions.
Let's go over them one by one:

  1: something that is said; esp : a brief remark
Example: a word of warning.
Clearly not applicable to Steve's strings.

  2: a speech sound or series of speech sounds that communicates a
     meaning; also : a graphic representation of such a sound or
     series of sounds
A series of sound that communicates a meaning. Some of Steve's strings
indeed convey a meaning. "menhir", "repaginate", "kibitzer" no problem
with those. But what about "corymbose","viyella","Ozymandius" and
"wheyface". Clearly no meaning was communicated from Australia to
France. (Nor did the four available dictionaries help...)

  3: ORDER, COMMAND
Example: The Word of God.
Evidently, not applicable here

  4 often cap: the second person of the Trinity; also : GOSPEL
Idem

  5: NEWS, INFORMATION
Example: Word went out, that Agora was taken over by Martians
As before, most of Steve's strings contain no information whatsover.

  6: PROMISE
Example: I gave my word of honour

  7 pl: QUARREL, DISPUTE
Example: It is certain that Steve and I will have words over this CFJ.

Concluding, at least four of Steve Prescribed Words were no Words at
all. This makes the Injunction illegal.

| Rules and Precedents: |
+-----------------------+
Rule 663 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 908 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

I support this proto, in its present form. 
 
Furthermore, I don't think we need any exceptions for so-called "emergency
proposals". Since we presumably will still need to wait 7 days for voting even
on emergency proposals, I don't see the need for the average 3.5 day reduction
in total time which the emergency proposal would produce. Also, "emergency"
could be abused.

Have you checked for precedence conflicts?

Ronald sez:

>Here is the formal proto to change the F-A reward into 2*F-A.

Caution; I am not sure this is a good idea. This will cause more proposals and
will do nothing to improve the quality. Indeed, it may lower the average
quality somewhat, because proposers may be less concerned about producing a
passable proposal. They make a profit even if somewhat over 1/3 vote for it.


Steve sez:

Perhaps 2*(F-A) is more appropriate. This will increase the average gain *and*
loss for proposers, thereby making proposing more profitable for *good*
proposers, and also somewhat shortening the average length of a Game, which may

OK, maybe I did overreact a bit. I don't approve of eir disapproval, but I will
accept the Kudo loss with dignity, and I would like to apologize for falsly

Why don't you do a test run choosing 1000 names?
For N names everybody should be chosen on average 1000/N times.
Plot the actual frequencies. You ought to get a normal distribution
with mean 1000/N and root-mean-square about sqrt(1000/N).
(The root-mean-square is about half of the width of the distribution
measured at the half of its height.)

I don't see any substantive problem, just a couple of insubstantial quibbles:

I believe that "time()" requires an argument, either NULL or a pointer 
to a time_t variable to receive the current time.  Usually omitting the 
argument picks up a random address from the stack and tries to write it 
there (I know, I've done it). But you may have been saved by the "active=0" 
initialization!

Also, I'm told that using rand () % N is not recommended because the
low-order bits of many RNG's are not all that random, in the sense
that they may have short cycles, even though they should be evenly
distributed.  

They say us to use something like (int)(N * (rand () / ( 2147483648.0 )))
which depends more on the high-order bits.

I am yet to see a convincing argument as to why we should allow them. 

The only useful example anyone has been able to come up with has been
sunset rules, a capability long available to us and hardly ever used.
It seems to me that this aspect of the NAOMI reforms is complexity for
its own sake, and that it detracts from the overall package.  (By way
of contrast, mutability indices, allowing an n-tier precedence
hierarchy, are a Good Thing IMO.)

1036 unfortunately does.  Rule 908 (Apologies) uses "must submit". There
seems to be no other relevant Rules. 

Rule 1036 (Mutable, MI=1)
Making and Distributing Proposals

      A Proposal by a Player shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker.  As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number.
      Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the Proposal, and not
      later than any subsequently received Proposal, the Speaker shall
      distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players.

This must either be judged FALSE, or it will be impossible to keep
registered. After the condition applies, the person is no longer a Voter
and cannot possibly make such a request.  So it _has_ to be done before. 

Otherwise, I find Ronald's argument extremely shaky. OK, the sentence may 
(perhaps) be ambiguous, but the Judge may still choose to interpret it in
the least destructive way, and I urge him to do so.

Are you trying to teach me my job?

The chi-squared you get is the the square of rms I talk about.

The difference is that Vanyel can do my test even if he's not a

The idea is just to produce an incentive for more proposals!

The quality is not *that* important: bad proposals still will not pass.
It's only the scoring that changes not the voting.

I want to seduce the people who now submit 1 proposal/month or less,
because they are afraid to be burned, or just shy.
I want to fresh ideas, apart from Kelly's Reforms and my own scriptures.

i am quite disgusted with this latest attempt to slander my character.
i've already dekudoed Ronald this week for his "good girl" remark.
whether or not he will lose another Kudo next week will depend on
whether my outrage lasts that long or not.

i admit that i am not in that good a mood right now (it was a long day
at the Kitchen today and i'm tired) but i don't appreciate being the
target of yet another one of Ronald's blunderbuss shots.

Ronald, you've made several rather dubious claims and accusations
lately which the Rules quite simply do not bear out.  could you
_please_ take the time to verify that the Rules really do bear you out
before you go screaming all over the Public Forum?  maybe then your
Honour would be in better shape than it is now -- not to mention
various people's opinions of you.

Jeff> under Rule 1064 and _any_ of us can get that information!

you are not the only one to suspect this; as there was a suggested
amendment to 1064 a while back that explicitly protected vototron
contributions separately from the records pertaining to a Vote.  or
was that you?

looking at the result for Pr. 1325-1338, every one that passed would
still have passed even if the Vototron had voted against.  so what's
the big stink, Ronald?  why would i risk being caught electioneering
when i would naturally have known that the contributions would have
been unnecessary anyhow?  do you think i'm stupid?

if it will please you, though, i'll gladly recompute the results
ignoring all of Reform's Vototron contributions.  oh, gee, they all
still pass (except for 1329).  wow.  what a suprise.

That is out of the question. I do believe, however, that being on Hold 
allows you to defer the Apology until you are back.

BTW, does anyone have a source for the words "sussurate" and "viyella"?
They are the only words remaining after Kelly's help and my own research.

I haven't checked for "viyella" as a compound/derived word yet, but
"sussurate" seems completely impossible. Does anyone know what a "sussur" 
is?

Greetings,
Oerjan.

i am quite aware of my various functions (although i admit i

if you think i'm really doing that badly, Propose to relieve me of my

we currently allow them.  yet i don't see you (or anyone else)
proposing to disallow them.  seems like this lack of an argument to

on the other hand, we have good arguments for restricting them.
fortunately, we do: Rule 1322.

!By analogy: in our 1.5 years of play, we have never had a Player
!from Hawaii.  Nor have I seen any convincing arguments for allowing
!people from Hawaii to play.  Therefore we should forbid anyone from
!Hawaii from joining????!!!
!
!Down with 815!

ProtoProposal NE-HI

No person with an email address originating in the state of Hawaii
may be registered as a Player.  This Rule takes precedence over all
other Rules which govern who may be registered as a Player.

[Justification:  anyone living in Hawaii who wants to spend hours in
front of a computer terminal instead of roaming about the beautiful
islands must be psychologically deviant and would not contibute positively
to the Agoran Community.]

Cheers!

I disagree. I think the F-A award should be to reward those with skill at
passing proposals, not those who get rules passed.

Leave it as is, I say. 

Or, go to 2(F-A), NOT (2F)-A as some have suggested.

========================================
The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------

Rule 1020 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

----------------------------------------

Rule 101 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

----------------------------------------

Rule 116 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011 (Mutable, MI=1)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.
      (*Was: 450*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 478 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Public Forum

      The Public Forum is hereby defined as any medium by which one
      player sends or posts a message which, to the best of the
      sender's intent, knowledge, belief, and ability, is
      simultaneously sent to all active players and accurately dated
      to within 5 minutes. The terms "listserv" and "listserver" are
      synonymous with "Public Forum".

----------------------------------------

Rule 754 (Mutable, MI=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.
      (*Was: 435*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 795 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in points for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
      which specifies terminology or grammar.
      (*Was: 362*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1023 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action 
      "as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action 
      within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform.  Failure to observe these time
      requirements is a Class C Crime.  However, activity of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.
      (*Was: 805/907*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1079 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "Random"

      All occurrences of the word "random" or forms of it shall be
      taken to mean "any one of the choices with equally distributed
      possibility for each choice".

----------------------------------------

Rule 1274/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      Let Indices be ordered such that for any two Indices X and Y, X
      is greater than Y if and only if either both X and Y are real
      numbers and X is numerically greater than Y, or X is the special
      value Unanimity and Y is a real number.

History:
Created by Proposal 1274, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 459 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

The Rules
  This Category includes Rules about the Rules.  (See also
  "Making Proposals" which includes some Rules concerning Rule
  Changes, even in the absence of Proposals;  See also "The
  Rulekeepor and Archivist" which includes Rules regulating
  the Logical Ruleset.)
----------------------------------------

Rule 1021/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Mutability Indices

      Every Rule shall have associated with it an Index known as its
      Mutability Index.  No Rule may have a Mutability Index less than
      1.

      A Rule which has a Mutability Index of 1 is also known as
      "Mutable"; a Rule which has a Mutability Index of Unanimity is
      also known as "Immutable".  All other Rules are known as
      "Semimutable".

Amended(1) by Proposal 1280, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 1281/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Mutability Indices of New Rules

      A New Rule, when it is first enacted, shall have a Mutability
      Index of 1, unless another Rule allows a different Mutability
      Index.

History:
Created by Proposal 1281, Oct. 24 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 114/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      There must always be at least one Rule with a Mutability Index
      of 1.  Any Rule Change which would result in this condition
      becoming false shall not have any legal force.

      The Adoption of Rule Changes shall never become completely
      impermissible.

Amended by Proposal 1277, Oct. 24 1994
Renumbered from 1077 to 114 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 111/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

History:
...
Renumbered from 1076 to 111 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994
 
----------------------------------------

Rule 1022 (Mutable, MI=1)
Semimutable Rules

      Let there be a class of Rules distinct from the Mutable and
      Immutable Rules, known as the Semimutable Rules. Semimutable
      Rules may not be Created or Repealed by Proposals. Other Rules
      define how Rules become, or cease to be, Semimutable. A Rule is
      Semimutable if, and only if, its Mutability Index is strictly
      greater than 1, but less than Unanimity.  Hence, no Mutable
      Rule, nor any Immutable Rule, may be a Semimutable Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1030 (Mutable, MI=1)
Precedence Between Conflicting Rules

      There are two types of conflicts between rules: (a) conflicts
      between rules with the same Mutability Indices; (b) conflicts
      between rules with different Mutability Indices.

      (a) Conflicts between Rules with the same Mutability Indices:

      If two or more Rules with the same Mutability Indices conflict
      with one another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

      (b) Conflicts between Rules with different Mutability Indices:

      Other Rules define the resolution of conflicts between Rules
      with Mutability Indices of Unanimity and Rules with Mutability
      Indices of 1.

      Otherwise, in a conflict between rules with different Mutability
      Indices, the rule with the higher Mutability Index takes
      precedence over the Rule with the lower Mutability Index. 

----------------------------------------



========================================
The Players
  This Category includes Rules defining and classifying Players.
----------------------------------------

Rule 869/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.  No person
      may be registered as a Player more than once concurrently.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose,
      then the use of that Player's Agora nickname is prefered, but
      not obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is
      allowed.

Amended(1) by Proposal 1313, Nov. 12 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 113/1 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Players May Always Forfeit

      A Player may always deregister from the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player to incur 
      it, may be imposed.

----------------------------------------

Rule 103 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
The Speaker and Voters

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

----------------------------------------

Rule 494 (Mutable, MI=1)
Speaker Makes Random Determinations

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------

Rule 104 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1016/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Putting Oneself on Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
      a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may not
      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

----------------------------------------

Rule 1043/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration

      A Voter may deregister from Agora by sending a message to the
      Public Forum announcing eir deregistration. A Voter who
      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and e may not reregister
      as a Player until a new Game has begun.

      Other Rules may define other conditions under which Voters may
      be deregistered.

History:
...
Amended(1) by Proposal 1305, Nov. 4 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 1042/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration Due to Inactivity

      A Voter is deregistered when one of the following conditions
      applies:

         (i) E is not On Hold, has not previously asked the Registrar
             to remain registered, and has not, for 14 consecutive
             calendar days, either sent a message to the Public Forum,
             or sent a message to another Player of a kind which the
             Rules require to be recorded in a Report which becomes
             publically available.

        (ii) E is On Hold for a period exceeding 2 months. 

      However, the above conditions do not cause deregistration until
      the condition which would cause deregistration is brought to the
      attention of the Registrar in a message to the Public Forum,
      correctly noting that the Voter is subject to deregistration.
      The Registrar must publicly verify the correctness of the claim
      to the best of eir ability, as soon as possible. The Voter is
      deregistered at the time the message correctly claiming
      deregistration appears on the Public Forum. If the Registrar
      does not respond within one Week, then e is considered negligent
      and the Speaker shall make the verification and announcement
      instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule leaving deregistration
      of a Player entirely in the hands of that Player.

========================================
Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals.
----------------------------------------

Rule 105/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:
        1) the enactment of a new Rule (a "Creation"). ;
        2) the amendment of an existing Rule (an "Amendment");
        3) the repeal of an existing Rule (a "Repeal");
        4) the modification of an existing Rule's Mutability Index (a
           "Mutation").

      Additional Rule Changes may be created by appropriate
      legislation.  No Rule Change may directly change any part of the
      Game State other than the Rules.  No Rule may be changed except
      by the means of a Rule Change of a type specified in the Rules.

History:
...
Amended by Proposal 1275, Oct 24 1994
Renumbered from 1072 to 105 by Rule 1295, Nov 1 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 115 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 107 (Immutable, MI=Unanimity)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1078 (Semimutable, MI=3)
RC and NRC Proposals

      New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long
      as they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change
      one or more Rules, without making any other direct changes to
      the Game State.

      All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of
      Proposal may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as
      proposed Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not
      change any Rule in any way, and they shall not under any
      circumstances be incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class
      of such Proposals shall not be valid unless the Rules define
      which Player or Players must maintain a current record of that
      class of Proposals, or explicitly state that that class need not
      be recorded.

      The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals
      that are not Rule Changes.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the
      nature of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1068 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Mutation

      Let there be a Rule Change known as Mutation. A Proposal to
      Mutate a Rule must contain the Declaration (Mutates a Rule),
      and, if adopted, has the effect of altering the Mutability Index
      of the Rule to be Mutated. It may have no other effects. The
      text of the Proposal must explicitly state the number of exactly
      one Rule to be Mutated, and its proposed new Mutability Index.
      Otherwise, the Proposal is not properly made. Immutable and
      Mutable Rules may each be Mutated into Semimutable Rules, and
      vice versa, and Semimutable Rules may be Mutated into
      Semimutable Rules with different Mutability Indices.

      A Proposal to Mutate an Immutable Rule has an Adoption Factor of
      3.

      In all other cases, a Proposal to Mutate a Rule has an Adoption
      Factor equal to the Mutability Index of the Rule to be Mutated,
      or the proposed new Mutability Index, whichever is greater.

      A Proposal to Mutate an Immutable Rule which proposes a new
      Mutability Index for the Rule which is other than 3 is not
      properly made.
      (*Was: 1056*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 594/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

      Courts (CotC) shall randomply appoint a Player to Judge that
      CFJ from amongst the Eligible Players. For the purposes of this
      Rule, the Eligible Players shall be the set of Players excluding 
      those:

        (i) who are On Hold;
       (ii) who are Barred from Judging the CFJ;
      (iii) who made the CFJ;
       (iv) whose Move the legality of which is to be determined by
            the CFJ;
        (v) who have declined to be Appointed as Judge on the CFJ;
       (vi) who are otherwise ineligible to Judge as specified in the
            Rules.

      Players may decline to be Appointed as Judge on a particular
      CFJ by notifying the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The
      declining Player shall not be Eligible to serve as Judge for
      that CFJ and shall also lose two points, one of which shall be
      given to the CotC.

      If for any reason a Player who has been selected as a Judge of
      a CFJ becomes ineligible to Judge, either by declining
      Appointment, by going On Hold, by being deregistered and hence
      ceasing to be a Player, or by other means specified in the
      Rules, then the CotC shall select another Eligible Player to
      Judge the CFJ.

Judgements Not Made Within Time Limit

      Any Player who does not responds in the allotted time to
      a request to be Judge, can not be selected again as a Judge,
      before he/she specifically asks for it in a message to the
      Clerk.

      Any Player who goes On Hold while a CFJ is pending, for which
      that Player was selected as Judge before e went On Hold and
      which is not yet Judged, will loose 2 Points per pending CFJ.

Delivering Judgement
  This Category includes Rules regulating the Judgement delivered
  by the Judge, as well as Injunctions.
----------------------------------------

Rule 408 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

----------------------------------------

Rule 591/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Legal Judgements

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

----------------------------------------

Rule 451 (Mutable, MI=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

      A Judge who delivers a legal Judgment or Decision

      within 72 hours receives 2 Points extra.

----------------------------------------

Rule 663 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

----------------------------------------

Rule 665 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

----------------------------------------

Rule 789 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Overturning Judgement

Rule 910 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appeals and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office 
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

----------------------------------------

Rule 911 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.

Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not

      defining the "Logical Rule Set Format".
      (*Was: 399*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1048 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Logical Ruleset

      Whenever the Rulekeepor publishes the complete Rule Set, e shall
      do so in the "Logical Rule Set Format". In this format, each
      Rule is assigned to a principal Category, and the Rules are
      grouped according to their Category. Within a Category, the
      ordering of Rules is decided by the Rulekeepor. All existing
      Rule Catories must be listed, along with a brief description,
      whether or not any Rules currently are assigned to the Category.

      Whenever a new Rule is added, it is assigned to the most
      appropriate Category in the opinion of the Rulekeepor, who must
      choose from existing Categories. Once e assigns a Rule to a
      Category, e may not change it except as provided by other Rules.

      However, if the Proposal itself stipulates a specific Category,
      as provided for by other Rules, the Rulekeepor is required to
      abide by this, if it is a valid defined Category. Also, a Rule's
      Category may be changed by a type of Proposal defined in other
      Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1053 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creating a Rule in a Specified Category

      A Proposal to create a Rule may specify the Category to which
      the Rule will be assigned in the Rule Set. Such a Proposal must
      contain a line immediately after the declaration of the form,
      "(Category: <XXX>)", where <XXX> is a Category. This line does
      not become part of the Rule if the Proposal should pass. If the
      Proposal passes, the Rulekeepor must assign the Rule to Category
      <XXX> if it is a defined category.

      The Proposal is legal regardless of whether or not the specified
      Category is an actual Category. If it is not, the category line
      is ignored. In no case does the category line become part of the
      Rule if the Proposal passes. 

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would treat a
      category line as part of a Rule.

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.

      the Scorekeepor; however, the Vizier is legally responsible for
      ensuring that such a Point transfer is consistent with eir
      Group's Ordinances.

      * Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other
      Rules.

      Legal Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

----------------------------------------

Rule 937/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      but that source does not Possess enough Marks, then all the
      Marks possessed by the source shall be transfered, and the
      remainder of the Marks shall be transfered as the source
      receives them.

Rule 724 (Mutable, MI=1)
Winning the Game

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the

      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",
      substituting for X the ratio of the Points required for that
      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped

Rule 785 (Mutable, MI=1)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

Rule 681 (Mutable, MI=1)
Giving Up Speakership

      A Speaker may voluntarily give up Speakership, by announcing the
      fact to all Players and proceeding according to other Rules
      governing the orderly transfer of power of a Speaker. The
      Speaker is replaced by a temporary Speaker according to the
      Rules of Succession. The Game is not over in this case, and
      Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues until a Player
      Wins, at which time a new Game is begin and the Winner becomes
      the real Speaker.

      Restrictions: The ex-Speaker loses 10 Points immediately, and if
      the resulting Score is greater than the average Score of all
      Players, then eir score is set to the average Score.

----------------------------------------

Rule 942 (Mutable, MI=1)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

Rule 786 (Mutable, MI=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker

      When a Speaker is to be replaced according to the "Rules of

      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to

      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 715 (Mutable, MI=1)
Registrar Keeps Track of Groups

      The Registrar shall keep a record of all currently formed
      Groups, their Memberships, Viziers, and Ordinancekeepors; as
      well as a record of all unaffiliated Players; and such other
      data as are required in order to make the Group Report.

----------------------------------------

Rule 717 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Group Report

      Not less than once each Nomic Week, the Registrar must post the
      Group Report in the Public Forum.  This report shall
      contain:
      1.  A list of unaffiliated Players;
      2.  A list of currently formed Groups, and for each Group the
      following information:
          (a) the Name of the Group;
          (b) the Vizier of the Group;
          (c) the Ordinancekeepor of the Group; and
          (d) the Membership of the Group.

----------------------------------------

Rule 716 (Mutable, MI=1)
How to Form a Group

      A Group shall be registered with the Registrar under the
      following conditions.  At least three Players in a certain
      subset X of the set of active Players must each send the
      Registrar a message (known as the Application) containing a list
      of the set X of Players, all of whom must be unaffiliated with
      any other Group; and a name for the proposed Group.  The
      Application may also contain an Initial Set of Ordinances
      for the Group.

      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, than the Group shall be registered, with
      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along with its Name
      and Membership.

----------------------------------------

Rule 719 (Mutable, MI=1)
Joining a Group

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.

      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

----------------------------------------

Rule 721 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1324/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Renaming a Group

      A Group may change its Name by the means of a message sent from
      its Vizier to the Registrar requesting its name be changed.
      However, the Vizier may send such a message only as permitted by
      the Ordinances of that Group; or, if the Ordinances of a Group
      are silent on the matter of changing the Group's name, with the
      unanimous consent of the Group's members.

History:
Created by Proposal 1324, Nov. 21 1994

----------------------------------------

Rule 767 (Mutable, MI=1)
Votes for Groups

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.
      (*Was: 646*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 718 (Mutable, MI=1)
Resignation from a Group

      A player may resign from a Group of which e is a Member, at any
      time, by sending such a message to the Registrar and the Vizier
      of that Group.  This rule takes precedence over all other rules
      concerning Groups.

----------------------------------------

Rule 762 (Mutable, MI=1)
Player Gets a Share of the Treasury Upon Leaving the Group

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.

Honour
  This Category includes Rules regulating Honour and Kudos.

Rule 1062 (Mutable, MI=1)

      Initially every Player holds 20 Kudos. New Players shall start
      with 20 Kudos as well. No Player shall have less than zero
      Kudos.  Players who are deregistered for any reason, but return
      to the game within three consecutive calender months of their
      departure start with the same number of Kudos they had prior
      to leaving; Players who return after a longer period are
      treated as new Players.  No Player shall have a  non-integral
      number of Kudos.  The number of Kudos held by each Player shall
      be kept track of by the Herald (an Officer) and published at
      least weekly.

      No more than once per Nomic week each Player may send a message
      to the Herald requesting the transfer of exactly one Kudo from
      one Player of eis choice to another Player of eis choice. The
      requesting Player may not eimself be the receiving Player.

      A Player who holds less than 6 Kudos may be known and addressed
      as `Honourless Worm', shall address Players with more Honour as
      `Your Honour', and shall either sign every message to the Public
      Forum 'Honourless Worm _______', where _______ is their normal
      name/nickname, or pay 4 points and .1 Marks per message lacking
      that signature or a variation of it in the same spirit.

      A Player who holds more than fourty Kudos shall be known and
      addressed as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less
      Honour in any way e sees fit.
      (*Was: 1025*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1008 (Mutable, MI=1)

      Let there be the Patent Title known as `Shogun', which is
      awarded to the Mighty Samourai (or Mighty Samourais) with the
      most Kudos.

      Only the Player(s) who have currently the most Honour my hold
      this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Herald, who must make the
      announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware of a
      change in holder of the Title.

Are you sure you really want to punish someone for becoming Speaker?
At least give em some time (a Week perhaps) to transfer Office.

It is very interesting to analyse the Vototron contributions for today's
bunch of Proposals.
The Reform Group, Nomic Entity and Vlad contibuted.
Let's see what happened...

1325 up to 1328 are quite calm, only Reform contributes the minimum 0.1.
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1325     0.1 F
1326     0.1 F
1327     0.1 F
1328     0.1 F

Then N.E. and Vlad oppose 1329, Reform increases its bet to 1:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1329     1   F       0.5 A  0.2 A

The next proposal Vlad puts up 1.1. Reform immediately counters with 1.5:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1330     1.5 F              1.1 A

Then Reform goes back to 1, as Vlad decreases too:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1331     1   F              0.6 A

The next two nobody tries to beat Reform and thus:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1332     0.1 F
1333     0.1 F

In 1334 Vlad puts up 0.3, and Reform 0.5
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1334     0.5 F              0.3 A

1335 is very atypical, Reform looses (not important enough?):
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1335     0.1 F       0.5 A

But with 1336 Reform is back in business, as N.E. and Vlad both put
up Points, Reform goes to 1:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1336     1   F       0.5 A  0.2 A

On 1338 everybody agrees and Reform stays low:
         Reform:      N.E:  Vlad:
1338     0.1 F       0.5 F


Amusing, isn't it?

No it is not....

Let's not forget that Kelly is the Reform Vizier *and* Speaker.
She does get to see all Vototron contributions before the end of
the Voting Period. It is therefore very easy to adopt the Reform's
Vototron contribution to a level that just smothers the opposition.

However, it's not allowed. It's called Electioneering and
we have a Rule against it:

Rule 452 (Mutable, MI=1)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

I have no reason to believe that this is in fact happening.
In fact, I rather doubt it.


Having said that, let me point out that the Rules do not in fact
prohibit it:

I commented on this some time ago. Vototron contributions are not
part of the "current status of the vote", because the Vototron does 
*not* cast its vote until just before the end of voting. (Rule 574)

In fact, it's possible that the Vototron contributions fall under 
Rule 1064 and _any_ of us can get that information!

The Speaker's private knowledge of the Vototron's leanings are no 
different under the Rules than each Player's private knowledge of 
how eir Group will vote.  Yet I've never seen a proposal that a
Player cannot use _that_ knowledge.

Noticing this loophole was something that led me to oppose the 
Repeal of Rule 688, which was lost in the Grey Repeals:

    Rule 688 (repealed)
    No Vototron for the Speaker

    688.  Limits to the use of the Vototron

      The Speaker is not allowed to make use of the Vototron.
      This Rule takes precedence over Rule 574.

- elJefe

In the light of my suspicion that the current Speaker has problems
separating all her functions, I proto-Propose:

proto-PROPOSAL
Speaker may not be Officer
(Creates a Rule)

The Speaker shall not hold Offices.
When a Player holds Offices when e becomes Speaker, e is assumed to
have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office should be
re-filled in the normal manner.

Dear Herald:

Please transfer one Kudo from Kelly, for being extremely oversensitive

wheyface: a face as that of a person who is pallid, as from fear

corymbose: variant adj. form of corymb, a form of inflorescence in which
the flowers form a flat-topped or convex cluster. (Gr. korymbos)

viyella: not in my dictionary; note that words do not have to be English words.

Ozymandius: the capitalization seems to indicate that it is a proper noun,
and the name does sound familiar.

Besides, even if these were not in an English dictionary, that does not
disqualify them from wordship. (Wordhood? wordliness?) :)

In the matter of CFJ 724, I judge TRUE. Chuck's argument is logical:
the Injunction requested with CFJ 717 was not one of legally mandated
types of Injunction.  Therefore, Vlad did act illegally in issuing an
Injunction By Rule 908 I am therefore required to issue an Injunction
of my own requiring Vlad to submit a Formal Apology. The Prescribed Words
for this Formal Apology are: corymbose, viyella, Ozymandius, wheyface,
kibitzer, rehoboam, menhir, repaginate, zeugma, sussurate.
-------
Other notes:

I should like to note formally that Vlad is not to be held entirely
responsible for this misdemeanor. Some of the blame must fall to me,
for it was I who requested the Injunction of the illegal type in CFJ
717. His assumption that my requested Injunction was a legal one
was not unreasonable. I should therefore like to apolgize to Vlad
for having let him, albeit accidentally, into this trap.

I therefore direct the Herald: please transfer 1 kudo 
FROM Steve, for having led Vlad into making an illegal Move,
TO   Vlad, in reparation for the damage to his reputation so caused.

Dear Vanyel,

here is a CFJ asking to interpret a Rule.

Statement:
"In Rule 1042 the phrase `unless that Voter specifically asks the
Registrar to remain registered' means that a Voter has to submit this
request *after* the condition applies and not *before*."

Barred Players: the Pink Bimbo, Mr. Agora Digest, ElJefe

Arguments:
The problem I have, is a problem of understanding the English idiom.
The whole sentence is as follows:

 Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
 of the following conditions applies:
   -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
    Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
    Voter specifically asks the Registrar to remain registered;

Basically this has the form:
`A Voter who doesn't do X has forfeited, unless e asks not to.'

The Registrar currently has the practice to accept that players may
request not to be deregistered, long time before they seemingly
disappear. However, the Rule is made to protect the community from
disappearing Players. Accepting such requests *before* a disappearance
goes Against the Spirit of that idea.

And if we really had wanted that effect, then the sentence should have
been  phrased with a perfect tense:

 Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
 of the following conditions applies:
   -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
    Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
    Voter specifically has asked the Registrar to remain registered;
                       ^^^^^^^^^
which has the form:
`A Voter who doesn't do X has forfeited, unless e has asked not to.'

I note that according to Rule 789, the Judge may issue an Injunction
if e Judges that my interpretation of the English idiom is the
correct one.

References:
Rule 789 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Rule 1042 (Mutable, MI=1)
Deregistration Due to Inactivity

      Voters shall be considered to have forfeited the Game when one
      of the following conditions applies:
        -a Voter is not On Hold but fails to cast a Vote, submit a
         Proposal or CFJ for 14 consecutive calendar days, unless that
         Voter specifically asks the Registrar to remain registered;
        -a Voter is On Hold for a period exceeding 2 months.

      If a former Player re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the
      same score as when e left and e shall not be considered a new
      Player.  Otherwise, e shall enter on the same terms as a new
      Player.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule leaving forfeiture of a
      Player entirely in the hands of that Player.

Content-Length: 7375
Lines: 167


Statement:
"By his choice of Prescribed Words in issuing the Injunction on CFJ 724,
Judge Steve violated Rule 908."

Barred Players: none

Arguments:

Note, that as long as this CFJ is pending, by Rule 663 Vlad is not
required to obey the Injunction with CFJ 724. I quote:

"All players must abide by
 the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
 publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
 [...]
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ."

Steve prescribed the following series of character strings to
be used in Vlad's Formal Apology: corymbose, viyella, Ozymandius,
wheyface, kibitzer, rehoboam, menhir, repaginate, zeugma, sussurate.

The problem is that some of these clearly are not words.
What is a word?
My online dictionary gives seven different definitions.
Let's go over them one by one:

  1: something that is said; esp : a brief remark
Example: a word of warning.
Clearly not applicable to Steve's strings.

  2: a speech sound or series of speech sounds that communicates a
     meaning; also : a graphic representation of such a sound or
     series of sounds
A series of sound that communicates a meaning. Some of Steve's strings
indeed convey a meaning. "menhir", "repaginate", "kibitzer" no problem
with those. But what about "corymbose","viyella","Ozymandius" and
"wheyface". Clearly no meaning was communicated from Australia to
France. (Nor did the four available dictionaries help...)

  3: ORDER, COMMAND
Example: The Word of God.
Evidently, not applicable here

  4 often cap: the second person of the Trinity; also : GOSPEL
Idem

  5: NEWS, INFORMATION
Example: Word went out, that Agora was taken over by Martians
As before, most of Steve's strings contain no information whatsover.

  6: PROMISE
Example: I gave my word of honour

  7 pl: QUARREL, DISPUTE
Example: It is certain that Steve and I will have words over this CFJ.

Concluding, at least four of Steve Prescribed Words were no Words at
all. This makes the Injunction illegal.

Rule 663 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

Rule 908 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

vanyel,

you seem like a sensible sort. one who knows that agora must be shaped by all
agorans.

so when we have a situation like we have now, where reform under the leadership
of mighty Kelly Bimbo is running away with the rules so fast that the rest of
us with real lives cannot keep up, you know that something must be done. 

yes, that is the best reason to support SLOWDOWN!

it is surprising that so many are blind to what is happening.

show your support by opposing rule change reform unless it is slow and careful.
(hint, what is going on now is neither slow nor careful!!!)

Judgement: TRUE

Reasoning: ElJefe presented four different arguments to support his claim and
           if any of the four were judged valid, then the claim would be found
           valid and a TRUE judgement would be returned.  Of the arguments
           presented, I found the reasoning in his second to be the clearest
           and most concise and so have chosen to use it as the basis for my
           judgement.  This is not to say that I found the reasoning in the
           others invalid, just that it needed a more careful examination than
           in this case and, unlike Chuck, I've chosen not to exhaust all of
           the possibilities this case presents.

           ElJefe's second argument was that the concept of "On Hold" was
           created by the Rules, in particular by Rule 1016, and exists only
           within the context of Agora Nomic.  Therefore it is protected by
           Rule 1011 and TALs attempt to place other players On Hold under
           Rule 116 was invalid, since Rule 116 does not apply in this case.

           That "On Hold" was created by the Rules is without a doubt.  That
           it exists only within the context of Agora Nomic also seems quite
           clear.  While there may be similar notions outside of the Agora
           Nomic context, none of them is an extension of the Agora Nomic
           concept outside of the Agora Nomic context.  Thus the criteria of
           Rule 1011 applies and "On Hold" may not be changed except as
           specified by the Rules.  Since no Rule allows a Player to change
           the Hold status of another Player without a message from that
           Player, TALs action was invalid.

Injunction: Although ELJefe could have requested an injunction under Rule
            789, he did not make such a request.  Therefore no injunction
            is issued.
