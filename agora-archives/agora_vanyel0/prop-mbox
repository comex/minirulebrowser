I disagree. I think the natural interpretation here is that "that event"
refers to the *first* event (otherwise, it would make no sense in the
latter intance, where an even triggers a requirement).  Since the beginning
of the voting period did not occur during a holiday, R1769 does not
change the time of the end of the Voting Period.

You might want to CFJ on it.  Meanwhile, Rule 1769 is indeed a mess, so:

Proto-Proposal:  Fix Holidays

Amend Rule 1769 (Holidays) to read:

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.

      If one Holiday begins within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday,
      the two Holidays and the time between them are taken as a single
      Holiday, unless this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days
      in length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days and
      the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor is neither required nor allowed
      to distribute any Proposals, and the Clerk of the Courts is
      neither required nor allowed to publish any Call for Judgement,
      Judgement, notice of Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or
      Opinion.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule that
      would require or allow such messages to be published during a
      Holiday.  However, if any of the above do take place during the
      Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not deprive
      them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following a
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends, all Rules to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time after another event, and the original event occurs
      during a Holiday, then the original event shall be deemed to occur
      when that Holiday ends, for the purpose of determining the calculated
      time.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time after another event, and the calculated time
      occurs during a Holiday, then the calculated time shall be deemed
      to be the end of that Holiday.

I don't think this is quite sufficient, because it doesn't deal with
another grey area in the Holiday Rules, namely what we might call
"pseudo-requirements" such as voting. Players are not required to vote,
so there is a sense in which voting is not an action which a Player is
required to perform before a given time. On the other hand, a Player who
wishes to vote is required to do so before the end of the Voting Period,
and so in another sense is required to act before a given a time - if e
wishes to cast a vote. One could sensibly interpret the word
"requirement" in either way.

I'm pretty sure that this issue has been before the Courts before, but
once again my memory fails me and I have no idea which CFJ it was, nor
what decision was made. Can anyone help me out here?

Steve

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal #3956 by harvel, AI=1
Issues

Amend R.1764 by inserting at the beginning of its text the 
ONE-delimited text; by replacing section (a) with the TWO-delimited
text; by replacing section (c) with the THREE-delimited text; and
by replacing each occurrence in section (d) of 'Proposal, Election or 
Referendum' with 'Issue'.


ONE
	There are three classes of Issues: Proposals, Elections, and
	Referenda.
ONE

TWO
	(a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
	    Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the 
	    prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.
TWO

THREE
	(c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of voting for
	    that particular Issue is permanently set to the prevailing mode
	    for that class of Issue.
THREE


Amend R.1715 by replacing its entire text with the FOUR-delimited text.

FOUR
	A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on an Issue by sending a
	message to that effect to the Issue's Vote Collector.  Solely for
	the purpose of determining Quorum, this Player is considered to have
	voted on that Issue.  If e also casts a Vote on that Issue, e is 
	counted only once toward Quorum.
FOUR


Amend R.1717 by replacing the FIVE-delimited text with the SIX-delimited
text.


FIVE
      At any time during the Voting Period of a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by stating
      so in the Public Forum. If that does not happen, it is not a
      Senate Vote.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Votes. If an
      Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum by the time it becomes a Senate Vote,
      eir votes are cancelled.
FIVE

SIX
	At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue, the Speaker
	may make it a Senate Vote, by stating so in a Public Forum.  An
	Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

	Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
	Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
	cancelled.
SIX


Amend R.879 by inserting at the end of R.879's text the SEVEN-delimited
text.

SEVEN
	Other Rules may provide an explicit method whereby a Player who has
	not voted on a Proposal may be considered, for the purposes of Quorum,
	to have voted on that Proposal.
SEVEN

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #3957 by Wes, AI=1

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1824 (Debt Voting) be amended to read:

      If, at the beginning of the week, there is at least one Overdue
      Payment Order billing the Payor for Voting upon Proposals, then
      the Payor commits the Infraction of Debt Voting. This Infraction
      shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens, and shall
      bear the penalty of the denial of Voting Privileges for a period
      of two weeks.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1823 (Combining Payment Orders) be
amended by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for Voting
      upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with Payment
      Orders executed for any other purpose.

with text which reads:

      Payment Orders executed for the purpose of billing the Payor for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Someone else can, if they want to.  As Rulekeepor, I have treated the
Assessor's Report of Dec. 28 as a valid and correct one, and have recorded

assessed in that report.

Another message that originally did not get through because of being
from a non-subscriber. For the time being I will solve this by subscribing
these people by hand. Again note that it is not clear whether or not
this has been sent to the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I see that my last two messages did not get through.

So, pursuant to the vacated Voting POs, I hereby issue the following:

The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Elysion 4 +VTs.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Elysion 4 +VTs.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay harvel 1 +VT.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Wes 1 +VT.

The +VT Bank pays these.

XXX-delimited text.

submitted explicitly states that it is a Secret Proposal,

A Secret Proposal has its Priority Cost increased by 1.

A Player may increase the Priority of a Secret Proposal, by indicating 
to the Promotor that e does so, naming the integer amount by which 
the Priority is to be increased, and transferring to the Bank a number 
of P-Notes equal to the amount of the increase times the Priority Cost 
of that Proposal provided that the transfer is not executed for any other 
purpose.

WWW-delimited text.

WWW

Proposal #342 by t, AI=1
Important Proposals

Create a new rule "Important Proposals" with the following X-delimited
text:

X

        Proposals are either Unimportant or Important. When made,       
        all Proposals are Unimportant. A Player may, with 2
        Supporters, make an Interested, non-Insane Proposal in the
        Queue Important.

        A Player Active for the entire Voting Period of an Important
        Proposal and able to vote on that Proposal who doesn't cast a
        vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Despising Agoran Democracy. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        A Player able to vote on an Important Proposal who goes On Hold
        during the Voting Period of an that Proposal and who doesn't cast
        a vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Dodging Responsibilities. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        If an Important Proposal fails to achieve Quorum, all Players
        who committed one of the above mentioned Infractions on that
        Proposal also commit the extra Class 1.0 Infraction of Being a
        Lazy Bugger. The Assessor is authorized to report this Infraction.

X

Amend Rule 1623 by adding the following Z-delimited text to the end of the
rule:

Z
        Only Unimportant Proposals can be made Disinterested. If an
        Important Proposal is ever Disinterested, it immediately becomes
        Interested.

Proposal #344 by Elysion, AI=1
Agora Improvement I: The Flotation Kicked Her

Rule 1887/2 (Default Procedure for Auctions) is hereby amended by
replacing the text reading:

     (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
         there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
         winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours have passed
         without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
         time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
         end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
         ended earlier.

with:

     (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
         there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
         winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have passed
         without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
         time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
         end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
         ended earlier.

Rule 1874/2 (Actions With N Supporters) is hereby amended by
replacing the text reading:

     (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
         days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
         announcing the intent to make the change;

with:

     (a) the post announcing the change is made no more than fourteen
         days after the post announcing the intent to make the
         change;

[ This fix should have been implemented a long time ago. ]

Rule 1643 (Statements of Policy) is hereby repealed.

[ There's no use for it, let's not clutter up the ruleset. ]

Rule 1908/1 (Automatic Dispensation) is hereby amended to read:

      If an entity is placed in Probate, the Notary shall become its
      Executor and shall perform the following actions as soon as
      possi[ble in the following order:

        i) The Notary shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
        its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
        amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
        not. All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
        cancelled.

      If the entity in Probate is not terminal, the Notary shall stop
      here and remove the entity from Probate.

        ii) The Notary shall apply the Will, if any, of the entity in
        Probate to the extent possible. Any assets remaining after the
        application of the Will shall be divided amongst the heirs
        named in the Will, assigning to each heir a portion computed
        in a manner consistent with the Will; if the Will is silent or
        unclear on the division of remaining assets, the division
        shall be equal.

        iii) The Notary shall assign any remaining Indulgences to the
        Bank, and expunge an equal number of the entity in Probate's
        Blots.  If the entity does not have that many Blots, then the
        Notary shall expunge all of the entity's Blots.

        iv) If the entity in Probate has Blots remaining, then the
        Notary shall assign all Indulgence credits to the Bank, and
        expunge a number of the entity's Blots equal to the total
        amount of the credits thus assigned.  If the entity does not
        have that many Blots, then the Notary shall expunge all of the
        entity's Blots.

        v) The Notary shall cancel any remaining credits, and assign
        any remaining units of a Currency to the Mintor of that
        Currency.

        vi) The Notary shall remove the entity from Probate

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by issuing a
      Transfer Order for those units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by issuing a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned, for the same amount of Currency as specified by the credit.
      However, if these are the same entity, then the credit is assigned by
      doing nothing. A debt is cancelled by vacating the Payment Order
      which established it.

      The Notary may perform actions as the Executor of an entity
      in Probate only as specified in this rule.

[ This is essentially what we have now, with the provisions to remove the
entity from Probate and the final sentence restricting the Notary's
power. ]

Rule 1904/0 (Honourary Players) is hereby amended to read:

      The Registrar may cause any person to become or to cease to be an
      Honourary Player Without 2 Objections by posting such to the Public
      Forum identifying in some unambigous manner the person (or persons)
      being honoured in this way. No current Player may ever become an
      Honourary Player, and any Honourary Player who becomes a current
      Player shall immediately cease to be an Honourary Player.

      Honourary Players are not considered to be Players with respect
      to the Rules or any other Nomic Entity within Agora Nomic.

[ Players can now be de-HP'ed and Agora no longer tries to tell other
Nomics about reality which, as we saw with Acka, is pointless. ]

Important Proposals

Create a new rule "Important Proposals" with the following X-delimited
text:

X

        Proposals are either Unimportant or Important. When made,       
        all Proposals are Unimportant. A Player may, with 2
        Supporters, make an Interested, non-Insane Proposal in the
        Queue Important.

        A Player Active for the entire Voting Period of an Important
        Proposal and able to vote on that Proposal who doesn't cast a
        vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Despising Agoran Democracy. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        A Player able to vote on an Important Proposal who goes On Hold
        during the Voting Period of an that Proposal and who doesn't cast
        a vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Dodging Responsibilities. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        If an Important Proposal fails to achieve Quorum, all Players
        who committed one of the above mentioned Infractions on that
        Proposal also commit the extra Class 1.0 Infraction of Being a
        Lazy Bugger. The Assessor is authorized to report this Infraction.

X

Amend Rule 1623 by adding the following Z-delimited text to the end of the
rule:

Z
        Only Unimportant Proposals can be made Disinterested. If an
        Important Proposal is ever Disinterested, it immediately becomes
        Interested.

During the Week beginning 13 December, "Issues" and "Discarding the Chaff" 
were supposed to be distributed, but no proposals were distributed.  I believe
this had to do with RL---possibly illness.  

In any case, those two, along with two Disinterested Proposals, were distributed
during the Week beginning 20 December.  But "Voters and Legislators 1.6" and
"This Isn't a Scam, Is It?" were scheduled to be distributed during that 
Week (and were not).

So this Week's proposals should be "Important Proposals" and "Voodoo".

I'm not sure what should be done to rectify this.  I'm hesitant to report this
as an Infraction, since it seems like the problem will continue each Week
unless the Queue were to be drained, and besides, I'm not required to.

I remove any of my undistributed proposals in the Queue (which is
probably the two above, but just in case...).

You are correct - we were actually quite ill.

Actually, since "Issues" and "Discarding the Chaff" were still in the
Queue at the beginning of that Week (they aren't removed until they
are distributed), when the Batch for that Week was decided, they
were the Proposals included. 

> So this Week's proposals should be "Important Proposals" and "Voodoo".

Incorrect. At the beginning of this Week, when the Batch was calculated,
the Queue contained two Proposals with a higher Priority than either of
those.

We committed an Infraction during the Week beginning on the 20th, due
to the fact that we did not Distribute that Week (we also failed to
Report, if we recall correctly). None since then, though.

Proposals 3985 and 3986 are hereby made Democratic, the
necessary Support having been garnered.

I see three separate problems with this process:

1) Does not extend the Voting Period.  Addressed by my
    "Agora Abhors a Vacuum" Proposal.

2) Requires a four-day waiting period, no matter how
    quickly Support is given.  Addressed by Steve's
    "Streamline Actions with Support" Proposal.

3) Requires the Speaker to start the process.  This
    shouldn't be a big deal once #1 and/or #2 are fixed,
    but what about also allowing the Promotor to (with
    three Supporters) declare Proposals Democratic?
