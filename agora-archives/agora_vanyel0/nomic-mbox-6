Hello from ChrisM!

   It's been a while. I'm still not ready to devote the time to rejoining the game, but I'd like to 
follow it a little more closely. For your biography section: I once held the office of Clerk of the 
Courts. Interests include literature, mathematics, history, chemistry, music. Thanks a lot..! Please 
tell the folks on the newsgroup "hi" since I don't have usenet access right now. Also, don't bother 
replying to this because it's only a very temporary address, etc. Thanks again...

ChrisM

will likely not enter into internomic anymore, since the game has basically
fallen apart as of late, due to officer apathy and imminent lack of
webspace... unless anyone wants to be THS and webpublish all the stuff?

No changes except the present Agora slump. The lack of a Scorekeepor adds
to the problems of maintaining interest, I'm afraid.  (Also the lack
of activists like Kelly).

My wife and I decided to move here after she was offered a 2-year assignment
with her company.  I'm still consulting for my own company but our branch
here is fairly primitive regarding net access, so I've gotten my own local
account.

I have actually wound up being group Vizier, by default. Your application
for re-instatement would receive prompt attention!

Regards,

Hello.

Regarding your "Bio page" (http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora/bio.html),
I happened to look at this page recently, after my prolonged absence from
Agora, and I noticed that your entry for Xanadu is rather short, and not
completely correct.  If you wish to update it, read on...

Xanadu is, in Real Life, a gesalt entity, which includes Donna Maron and
myself (Andrew Bishop), as well as a few others.  Email for Xanadu is best
sent to both Donna (D.Maron@student.anu.edu.au) and myself
(A.Bishop@student.anu.edu.au).  Xanadu was a member of the Misanthropists'
group, before e was swamped with both study and Agora, and had to decide
which to continue (it was close - decided by the fact that eir only
access to email was through university).  Xanadu's main interest was to
test how Agorans would react to a blatant violation of the ruleset (at the
time Xanadu joined, there was a "one Player, one person" rule (to prevent
one person operating many Players), which explicitly prohibited gesalt
entities from joining as Players).  The results were interesting - Xanadu
was accepted, and a few months later, Kelly proposed some changes which
attempted to legalise Xanadu's existence.

Hopefully, we will find the time to rejoin Xanadu as an active player
within a few weeks.

Andrew Bishop
