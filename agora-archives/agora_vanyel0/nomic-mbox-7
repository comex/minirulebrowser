Since we are assuming Bob has access to the Game State, he could look up
to see if the Distributor made any such definition.  For example, right
now I have on the Web pages the fact that n-o and n-b and yoyo are the
PF.

How's about this for personal inconsistency: It occurs to me that it is
possible that Marks _have_ no dasein.  Where an Entity such as a Player
has a specific dasein to which various Properties adhere, a Mark has no
such central being.  Hm.

Hm.  That is weird--I think it's more like, Fred has 1 Mark, which has
the
property of being owned by Fred.  When he transfers 0.1 Mark to Bob,
then
the 0.9 Marks owned by Fred now have the property of being owned by
Fred.
When 2.3 Marks are then transferred from Wally to Fred, then the 3.2
Marks
owned by Fred have the property of being owned by Fred.  See?

Would it be terribly inconsistent to view Marks as follows: Marks are
not
like coins, which can be placed in a bucket together and still retain
their
own separate existence.  Marks are more like quantities of water, which
when separate have their own separate existence, but when combined have
a single existence...  I'm having a hard time explaining this, but
basically
I'm saying that the hundreds of Marks I currently own only have
existence
as a collective Entity.

Perhaps you are right here.

Actually, I merely put forth that example to show how silly the debate
can get...  The _courts_ may have ruled that the hatchet is the same,
but
I am still undecided.  The dasein of the hatchet may have been retained
in
one part of the hatchet even as the other was replaced, but I'm not so
sure
about that.

I know that this suggestion was tongue-in-cheek, but it reminded me of a
thought I had some time back... how about a list called nomic-ref or
nomic-reference, for those really big "references" that are made?  It
would be a non-PF list, *and* it would be logged somehow, so back
messages
could be requested.  Then, for (say) CFJs, only the Statement and
Judgement
would be posted on n-o, maybe the Injunction too, but the Arguments
could
be posted on n-r.  Or if an old CFJ was referenced in discussion, the
person who brought it up could mention it, and then send it along on
n-r.

The advantage of such a list would be that even people who were
interested
in the discussions wouldn't have to get spammed with huge messages which
were not entirely necessary.  It would be a "lower priority" than n-d,
and
the message count would be fairly low, so I could even keep individual
messages separately in the archives for easy retreival...

What do you think?  Would the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, or
vice versa?

Oo!  Geometric!!  I'd love to see the Scorekeepor take the 20th root of

Yes, like proposing Proposals which would _surely_ fail, and not be
penalized.  I can't think how this would be an advantage *at the
moment*,
however, I can easily visualize situations where it would be verrrrrry
useful.

I love it!!  "shall, at eir discretion" perfectly sums up the

option, while still retaining the type of language which "dictates what
