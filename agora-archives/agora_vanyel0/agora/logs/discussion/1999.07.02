Why bother with the wrapper? CFJ on the Statement: "The changes to the
Scoring Report announced by Vlad (in message such-and-such) went into
effect on June 1."

That's a quatrain from Nostradamus if I'm not mistaken?

Can you translate? I get the first line ("In the seventh month of
1999..."), but I'm unclear on what happens then. Something about the
great King of England being resuscitated?

Since I've been a Watcher or a Player for over a year now without introducing
myself, I've decided it's high time I do so.

My name, as is probably obvious, is Michael Slone.  I'm 20 and attend a small
college in Kentucky, US, majoring in philosophy and mathematics and minoring
in linguistics.  I used to speak French fairly well, albeit with a terrible
accent.  I like penguins (http://vir.fclib.org/~harvel/images/penguin.jpg),
drawing (cppeng.jpg), and programming.  I don't eat dead animals.  Before you
ask, I don't eat living ones, either, at least I don't think I do.  I still
think wrist watches are a pretty neat idea.  I have a job called ``technical
writing'' which strangely involves little or no writing on my part, but does
involve network troubleshooting.  I don't normally write paragraphs this long
about myself.

The egroups don't show headers.  How do i unambiguously refer to a message
that i only know about from egroups? is this sufficient:
I call for judgement on the following statement.

The changes to the scoring Rule announced in message 740 in the egroups
archive of agora-official are to be used for the current round which began
June 1, 1999.

I would like to conduct a straw poll regarding the payment of rewards
in my "A Separation of Money, but Not of Powers" proto.

For those of you who haven't been following the discussion, the
relevant idea here is this: certain currencies will be known as
basic currencies (+VTs and -VTs, now separate currencies, P-Notes,
and the new IATs).  Each player would select an associated basic
currency (ABC), and then, all rewards that player earned would
in essence be in eir ABC, and a Player's ABC could be changed only
rarely.

There are a number of ways to implement this.  None of these are
entirely without problems.  

1) A new currency, Stems, are created, along with a new Office (the
   Payroll Clerk to track them.  Rewards are payed in Stems; a Player
   can then transfer Stems to the Bank in order to be paid in eir ABC by the 
   Payroll Clerk.  The disadvantage here, as Blob pointed out, is
   that this significantly increases the delay before a Player receives
   functional currencies.

2) Officers who pay out rewards pay them directly in Player's ABCs.
  Suboptions:
   a) Each Officer who might pay out rewards must track each Player's
      ABC.  The disadvantage here is that redundant work is being done
      by several officers. (It could be made somewhat easier by requiring
      a single Officer to track and report ABCs, but other Officers would
      still have to keep a record of changes made since the last report,
      as well as considering errors in the report.)
   b) A single Officer tracks Players' ABCs and publishes them.  Officers
      who pay out rewards pay them out in the Player's last published
      ABC.  The disadvantage here is the lag between changing one's ABC
      and the reporting of that change, during which the Player is
      still paid in eir old ABC.
   x) Players who have not yet declared an ABC lose out on rewards.
      The disadvantages here are that this is rather unfair, and
      requires special provisions to be written into the Rules
   y) Players who have not yet declared an ABC are paid out in a
      default basic currency.  The disadvantage here is that it
      creates an artificial imbalance in currency levels--note
      our currenct situation with + and - VTs.  This may not be
      as much of a problem as long as the default currency is
      P-Notes or IATs.
   Note that (a) and (b) are alternatives, and (x) and (y) are alternatives,
   while a/b are orthogonal to x/y.

3) Payment Orders are allowed to be issued in ABCs generally rather
   than a specific currency.  (The current proto already does this
   with + and - VTs, allowing POs for VTs generally.)  The disadvantage
   here is that the only feasible way to do this is with the Chancellor
   tracking these POs--since they're all from the Bank, e can readily
   determine whether they've been satisfied or not, while anyone else
   doing it would likely involve too much handshaking with the Recordkeepors
   to determine whether a PO has been satisfied.  This is a significant
   increase in work for the Chancellor.
  Suboptions are (x) and (y) as under (2) above.


Questions:

1. Which of options (1), (2), or (3) would you prefer?  Which would be
   your second choice?

2. For option (2), would you prefer suboption (a) or (b)?  (Please answer
   regardless of your ranking of options in question 1.)

3. For options (2) and (3), would you prefer suboption (x) or (y)?  (Please
   answer regardless of your ranking of options in question 1.  If you
   have one preference for option (2), and the other for option (3),
   that's fine.)


Each player answering all questions in this straw poll within a week
will receive 0.1 +VT.  Also, if the ASOMBNOP proposal passes with
currency levels at the same general levels as currently outlined,
responders will recieve 1 of a basic currency to be determined later.
Feel free to send responses either to a-d or directly to me.

We tend to prefer this method, actually. Yes, it does involve a delay in obtaining functional Currencies, but then, that just requires one to plan a few things in advance. It also raises the possibility of paying Rewards in Stems, and providing an auction process to allocate certain functional Currencies (particularly Indulgences) rather than some set price. It also nicely introduces a very useful Currency of exchange which will facilitate several ideas we have on the back burner, just waiting for a reduction in the cost to Propose and Vote to get released into the system.

If option 2 is selected, we would prefer sub-option (a) with a slight twist. Each Officer who might pay out a Reward can maintain an ABC for each Player, but it would not necessarily have to be the same ABC as that Player has with another Officer. Although this would allow for a Player to have non-interactive access to more than one functional Currency, we feel that this is a reasonable reward in and of itself for a Player taking an active part in multiple parts of the Game which result in Rewards. 

Alternately, if sub-option (b) ends up being preferable, we would encourage that the same Officer who maintains the ABC for each Player eventually be responsible for the actually paying out of all, Rewards, thus eliminating the delay for reporting the new ABC. The Officers responsible for detecting the Rewards would then be required to notify the "Payroll Clerk" or whatever Officer ends up paying out Rewards, and the Payroll Clerk would then issue the appropriate PO's. This would result in a slight delay, but not a significant one, we think. Especially if the Chancellor were to be the Payroll Clerk. It would involve a raise in the work load, but not too significant a one, we don't think, since the Chancellor already has to deal with each of these transfers anyways to issue TO's.

Or Players who have not yet declared an ABC have their Rewards delayed until they declare one. They can continue to have outstanding PO's measured in Stems until they declare an ABC, allowing that PO to be satisfied. Phrase the ABC Rules correctly and this will be automatic.

We very much dislike this option, for much the same reason you state above. We think that a default Currency of P-Notes or IATs would be just as damaging as a disparity between + and - VTs.

If option (2) is selected, we got the idea that "Stem" would refer to a specific amount of the Player's ABC, dependant on eir declared ABC and the current ratio of Stems to that particular functional Currency. Is this what you are referring to here, or are we missing something?

> Questions:

As mentioned above, (1) is our first choice, with (2) as our second (we think, not understanding (3) fully).

See our comments above.

(x) hands down.

Ooooh. 0.1 VT. ;-)   Now 0.1 P-Notes would be much more interesting... <grin>

Except that Stems are not going to be allowed to be traded.  My
initial reaction was much like yours, but, as Chuck has already
pointed out (in the commentary with the original proposal), allowing
Stems to be traded would defeat the forced specialisation, and it is
this which is the underlying aim of the proposal.
 
Michael.

It should also me mentioned that egroups does show headers, too. In the upper right corner of the section where the body of the message is displayed, there is a small link for forward and a small link for source. Click source to see the header.

Why would allowing Stems to be traded defeat specialization, if each individual can only trade Stems for a single functional Currency? If we can only make P-Notes, we would still only be able to convert Stems to P-Notes, no matter how many we had. We would still have to trade for everything else. We may be able to trade you Stems for VT's because we can't currently make VT's, but we would probably have to trade you a slight surplus of Stems than you require to make VT's, depending on how good of friends we were. The amount of the surplus would depend on the market conditions present, and would make for an excellent economy.

If everyone was paying in exactly what they got back, there would be
no point, but as it is the richers Players are subsidising the poorer
Players and we have a redistributive welfare system.  As one of the
richer players I will be paying out about twice as much as I will be
getting back in terms of Birthday rewards.  Someone with 5 VTs or less
(such as yourself :-) will be given 3 VTs at no cost.  This is an
interesting political situation, methinks.

Then there will be this month's official salaries.  They are not
really a welfare system, but they have to be funded somehow if Players
are to be encouraged to fill the Offices.

Michael.

I recall reading somewhere about the large amount of insect parts you get

Don't you mean digital watches?

Greetings,
Ørjan, whose watch is analog, although with a battery, and needs manual
date correction every other month or so.

Of course, maybe if the Priority bar were just a wee bit lower, there would be more Proposals to Vote on, thus more VTs would go to the Bank *without* taxes. Of course, the fact that Proposals aren't even reaching Quorum due to the cost of Voting doesn't exactly encourage the making of Proposals. Strangely enough, Agora seems to be slowing down quite a bit.
