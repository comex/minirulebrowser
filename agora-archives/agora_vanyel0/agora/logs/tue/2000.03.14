Proposals 3985 and 3986 are hereby made Democratic, the
necessary Support having been garnered.

I see three separate problems with this process:

1) Does not extend the Voting Period.  Addressed by my
    "Agora Abhors a Vacuum" Proposal.

2) Requires a four-day waiting period, no matter how
    quickly Support is given.  Addressed by Steve's
    "Streamline Actions with Support" Proposal.

3) Requires the Speaker to start the process.  This
    shouldn't be a big deal once #1 and/or #2 are fixed,
    but what about also allowing the Promotor to (with
    three Supporters) declare Proposals Democratic?
