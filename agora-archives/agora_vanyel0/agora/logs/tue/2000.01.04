Well, I can call you H. Barkor Elysion if you'd prefer.

I have a question (alright, actually several questions): what purpose do
Denaria serve in the running of your Bank? As far I can see, all the Bank's
profits are generated from transfers which don't use Denaria, and which
attract the 5% surcharge, like the one I just made. Is the point to
encourage Players to make deposits to ensure you maintain liquidity? If so,
do you envisage a time when the Bank will have sufficient holdings of its to
make that incentive unnecessary? Finally, are you concerned that the rampant
oversupply of Denaria (another 3,000 minted this week, taking the total in
circulation to over 27,000) will devalue the Denaria and thereby reduce the
Bank's profits?

Steve

So what you're really saying is that you want us to be Guilty, but you
don't know why?

But apparently one in which the Holiday occurs 40 milliseconds after
the ASAP Period would cause us to break a Rule, since it is impossible
to publish in 40 milliseconds. Or perhaps anything coinciding, give or
take a few seconds. Or a few minutes. Or...

You dispute that we received it, yet possession of the message is not
in dispute. We're confused.

And where does Agoran Law have that legal consequence? We certainly
don't see anything. In RL, the only legal significanc of mailing
something to one's self is to establish evidence of the date that the
action was performed. If there is no controversy regarding the date,
then the act of mailing it to one's self is irrelevant.

We beg to differ. Lee posted eir Judgement on 23 Dec 1999 18:30:20 GMT.
You are saying that we were somehow required to publish that decision
sometime between then and 25 Dec 1999 00:00:00 GMT, a period of roughly
29.5 hours. Unless we calculated the times wrong, which is possible,
but our point would remain. 

Not only can we not find an interpretation of the Rules which would
require this, but simple common sense would deny this. How many Agorans,
or even just Officers, check their mail *every* day, particularly on
Christmas Eve? Any contention that the Rules required this, without any
kind of logical argument other than "it was possible" we find quite
ludicrous.

We have heard conclusions, but no logic to back them up. We still don't
see how Holidays specify an earlier "latest time" to perform duties.

We are not entirely sure that R1769 does this, however. It does not
specify a time by which something must be done, but simply prohibits
it from being done during a certain time period. Close, but not quite
the same thing. Since it effectively results in R1769 prohibiting
something that R1023 requires, we would see that as a conflict. If
R1769 used verbage equating to "actions must be performed before or
after, but not during" then we would agree with you. But as it is,
all R1769 does is say that certain actions are illegal under certain
circumstances, regardless of other Rules to the contrary.

The unfairness wasn't nearly as annoying as the total disregard for
providing some Rules-oriented logic behind it. At least this is an 
argument we could accept, even if we don't agree with it. Arguments
of the nature "we think it's this way, but we don't know why" are
not exactly up to snuff, especially when it's arguing in favor of
something unfair and counterintuitive.

Agora Improvement I: The Flotation Kicked Her

Rule 1887/2 (Default Procedure for Auctions) is hereby amended by
replacing the text reading:

     (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
         there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
         winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours have passed
         without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
         time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
         end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
         ended earlier.

     (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
         there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
         winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have passed
         without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
         time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
         end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
         ended earlier.

Rule 1874/2 (Actions With N Supporters) is hereby amended by
replacing the text reading:

     (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
         days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
         announcing the intent to make the change;

with:

     (a) the post announcing the change is made no more than fourteen
         days after the post announcing the intent to make the
         change;

[ This fix should have been implemented a long time ago. ]

Rule 1643 (Statements of Policy) is hereby repealed.

[ There's no use for it, let's not clutter up the ruleset. ]

Rule 1908/1 (Automatic Dispensation) is hereby amended to read:

      If an entity is placed in Probate, the Notary shall become its
      Executor and shall perform the following actions as soon as
      possi[ble in the following order:

        i) The Notary shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
        its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
        amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
        not. All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
        cancelled.

      If the entity in Probate is not terminal, the Notary shall stop
      here and remove the entity from Probate.

        ii) The Notary shall apply the Will, if any, of the entity in
        Probate to the extent possible. Any assets remaining after the
        application of the Will shall be divided amongst the heirs
        named in the Will, assigning to each heir a portion computed
        in a manner consistent with the Will; if the Will is silent or
        unclear on the division of remaining assets, the division
        shall be equal.

        iii) The Notary shall assign any remaining Indulgences to the
        Bank, and expunge an equal number of the entity in Probate's
        Blots.  If the entity does not have that many Blots, then the
        Notary shall expunge all of the entity's Blots.

        iv) If the entity in Probate has Blots remaining, then the
        Notary shall assign all Indulgence credits to the Bank, and
        expunge a number of the entity's Blots equal to the total
        amount of the credits thus assigned.  If the entity does not
        have that many Blots, then the Notary shall expunge all of the
        entity's Blots.

        v) The Notary shall cancel any remaining credits, and assign
        any remaining units of a Currency to the Mintor of that
        Currency.

        vi) The Notary shall remove the entity from Probate

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by issuing a
      Transfer Order for those units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by issuing a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned, for the same amount of Currency as specified by the credit.
      However, if these are the same entity, then the credit is assigned by
      doing nothing. A debt is cancelled by vacating the Payment Order
      which established it.

      The Notary may perform actions as the Executor of an entity
      in Probate only as specified in this rule.

[ This is essentially what we have now, with the provisions to remove the
entity from Probate and the final sentence restricting the Notary's
power. ]

Rule 1904/0 (Honourary Players) is hereby amended to read:

      The Registrar may cause any person to become or to cease to be an
      Honourary Player Without 2 Objections by posting such to the Public
      Forum identifying in some unambigous manner the person (or persons)
      being honoured in this way. No current Player may ever become an
      Honourary Player, and any Honourary Player who becomes a current
      Player shall immediately cease to be an Honourary Player.

      Honourary Players are not considered to be Players with respect
      to the Rules or any other Nomic Entity within Agora Nomic.

[ Players can now be de-HP'ed and Agora no longer tries to tell other
Nomics about reality which, as we saw with Acka, is pointless. ]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #342 by t, AI=1
Important Proposals

Create a new rule "Important Proposals" with the following X-delimited
text:

X

        Proposals are either Unimportant or Important. When made,       
        all Proposals are Unimportant. A Player may, with 2
        Supporters, make an Interested, non-Insane Proposal in the
        Queue Important.

        A Player Active for the entire Voting Period of an Important
        Proposal and able to vote on that Proposal who doesn't cast a
        vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Despising Agoran Democracy. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        A Player able to vote on an Important Proposal who goes On Hold
        during the Voting Period of an that Proposal and who doesn't cast
        a vote on that Proposal commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of
        Dodging Responsibilities. The Assessor is authorized to report
        this Infraction.

        If an Important Proposal fails to achieve Quorum, all Players
        who committed one of the above mentioned Infractions on that
        Proposal also commit the extra Class 1.0 Infraction of Being a
        Lazy Bugger. The Assessor is authorized to report this Infraction.

X

Amend Rule 1623 by adding the following Z-delimited text to the end of the
rule:

Z
        Only Unimportant Proposals can be made Disinterested. If an
        Important Proposal is ever Disinterested, it immediately becomes
        Interested.

Z

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #3961 by Peekee, AI=2

Voter but not Denied.  Each such entity may cast a number of votes on 
a Proposal up to their Maximum Votes as shown in the most recently 
published Accountor's Report at the time that the Proposal is 
distributed. If the Maximum Votes for a Voter have never been published 
at the time a Proposal is distributed, their Maximum Votes is 5 for 
that Proposal.
GREEN

Amend Rule 1925 "Legislative Status" to read as in the following BLACK-
delimited text.

BLACK
Legislative Status is a Nomic Property, which consists of a possibly 
empty set of values, from the set {Legislator, Voter, Mute, Denied}. 
Entities may possess a Legislative Status if and only if the Rules 
explicitly permit them to. The Promotor shall record which entities 
are Legislators or Mute, and the Assessor shall record which entities 
are Voters or Denied.

Players have a Legislative Status, and are both Legislators and Voters.  
Also, Players are Mute if they have more than 10 Blots and Denied if 
they have more than 15 Blots.
BLACK

the clear indication that the text is intended to become a Proposal. 
GREY

WHITE

of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it is 
intended to become a Proposal.
WHITE

Repeal Rule 1825 (Power=1) "Denying Voting Privileges"

Amend Rule 1824 (Power=1) "Debt Voting" to read as in the following

That is, apparently, the situation as we find it in the Rules. Of course we
cannot disagree with you that a case in which a Player was given a 40
millisecond window in which to perform an action would be even more
monstrously unfair than your own case, in which a 29.5 hour window existed.
But arguments about unfairness concern the law as it should be, not the law
as it is. (With the caveat that standards of fairness might enter into the
interpretation of the law via R217, where the law was otherwise silent,
inconsistent or unclear. I do not think that CFJ 1192 presents such a case.)

Saying that "Actions must be performed, but not during a Holiday" is
logically equivalent to saying that "Actions must be performed before or
after the Holiday, but not during the Holiday." In effect, the correct
verdict on CFJ 1192 comes down to the truth of falsity of the statement:
"R1769 imposes an earlier latest time than R1023 by which the CotC must
publish Judgements submitted in the week prior to a week-long Holiday."
R1769 doesn't say that outright, but it does end up having that effect (when
the Holiday lasts for a week).

The post to which you are referring was written at a time when my thoughts
on the subject were still in the process of coming into focus for me. I was
still making up my mind what I thought. Perhaps it would have been better to
say nothing at that point, but I hoped that by posting I might provoke
others into clarifiying the situation. I would certainly not have argued to
the Justices "I feel this way, but I can't offer you any justification." In
any case, because you seem to be taking this somewhat personally, let me
assure you that I have no desire that you be found Guilty per se. My only
wish is to discover the best sense that can be made of the Rules and to
apply it to the current situation.

There is no need for confusion. My point is quite simple: if you yourself
create an object, then you possess that object despite never having received
it from anyone via any medium. This why I think that possession of the
original file does not meet the requirement in R478 that messages sent to
what we may call "alternative Public Fora" be verifiably sent to each Active
Player. However, even a system copy automatically cced to you by your mailer
would probably be sufficient.

During the Week beginning 13 December, "Issues" and "Discarding the Chaff" 
were supposed to be distributed, but no proposals were distributed.  I believe
this had to do with RL---possibly illness.  

In any case, those two, along with two Disinterested Proposals, were distributed
during the Week beginning 20 December.  But "Voters and Legislators 1.6" and
"This Isn't a Scam, Is It?" were scheduled to be distributed during that 
Week (and were not).

So this Week's proposals should be "Important Proposals" and "Voodoo".

I'm not sure what should be done to rectify this.  I'm hesitant to report this
as an Infraction, since it seems like the problem will continue each Week
unless the Queue were to be drained, and besides, I'm not required to.

----------
This Protoproposal shall have AI=3.

Protoproposal h044.0.0 (Assortment of Minor Changes) 

Amend Rule 101 by striking the text reading ``explicitly or implicitly''.


Amend Rule 1011 to read:

	A Nomic Property is any property of any entity the value of which
	is defined by the Rules or the value of which may be modified by
	procedures defined by the Rules.  Other Rules may define procedures
	by which the value of a Nomic Property may be changed.


Amend Rule 1586 by replacing the text reading:

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

with text reading:

	A Nomic Entity is any non-Player entity the existence of which is
	declared or recognized by the Rules.  No two Nomic Entities shall
	have the same name.  Arbitrary members of a class of Nomic Entities 
	may be referred to by the name of that class, as long as there is no
	ambiguity.


Amend Rule 478 by replacing the text reading:

	Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
        every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
        Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
        it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
	verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active 
	Player.

with text reading:

	A Player who sends a message, by any medium or combination of media,
	to all other Players, shall be deemed to have sent the message to a
        Public Forum, provided that it bears a clear indication that it is 
	is intended to be a message to a Public Forum, and it is verifiable
	that the message was sent to all other Players.


Amend Rule 1688 to read:

	Power is an Index.  An Instrument is an entity with nonzero Power.
	The Power of a given entity is zero unless otherwise defined by
	the Rules.

(Note: when an Office is recorded as being held "temporarily since X",
       this does not mean that the Office has been held temporarily
       for all that time, but rather that the Office is now held
       temporarily, and that the current incumbent has held it (one
       way or another) since the time given.  This presentation of
       information is more useful for the calculation of salary
       entitlement.)

I've adopted the wording and placement (at the top of the proto) for the
Grandfathering clauses suggested by Murphy. But now I'm worried: can + and -
VTs be turned into unsigned VTs in Part I, when unsigned VTs don't come back
into existence until Part II? If that's a problem, I think I should perhaps
go back to my original, clumsier wording which doesn't try to convert
existing Currencies, but which at least avoids problems of this kind.

####
Proto-Proposal
Return of the Unsigned VT

Part I:  Grandfathering (with thanks to Murphy for the wording)

On the adoption of this Proposal, all +VTs and -VTs become VTs, 
and all Payment Orders naming +VTs or -VTs as a Currency are 
amended to name VTs as a Currency.

Part II: Legislative changes

Be it hereby resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read: 

	Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Bank Currency. The MUQ of VTs is 
	0.01. The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor. VTs are a 
	Basic Currency.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (The Cost of Voting) be amended to read: 

	As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of an 
	Interested Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each entity that voted 
	on the Proposal a number of Voting Tokens equal to the square of 
	the total number of votes (FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN) cast by 
	the entity on that Proposal.

Be it further resolved that R1913 (Definition of Expected Currencies) be 
amended by deleting from it the paragraph which reads: 

	There is also an Expected number of VTs, which is equal to the sum 
	of currently owned +VTs and -VTs, and taking into account all 
	Outstanding POs for +VTs, -VTs, as well as for unspecified VTs, as 
	above.

Be it further resolved that R1813 (Debt) be amended by replacing the text in
it 
which currently reads: 

	If an entity has more than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as 
	payor, its Executor commits as many such Infractions as there are 
	different Currencies named in all these Overdue Payment Orders, save

	that only one such Infraction is committed for Overdue Payment 
	Orders in +VTs, -VTs, and unspecified VTs.

with text which reads: 

	If an entity has more than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as 
	payor, its Executor commits as many such Infractions as there are 
	different Currencies named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

I remove any of my undistributed proposals in the Queue (which is

Suppose the following ruleset:

Rule 1. Rules with lower numbers take precedence.
Rule 2. Players may jump.
Rule 3. Players may not jump.

Am I allowed to jump? Yes. If I jump, do I still break rule 3? I would
say yes, _even though a higher priority rule permits it_.

Thus, by the simple fact that Wes distribute the CFJ during a holiday e
is guilty, whether e was required to do so at that time or not.
Admittedly, this is rather unfair, and the current precedence
implementation is rather problematic. Perhaps _all_ precedence
implementations are problematic, since they have to lift themselves by
their bootstraps, so to speak. Consider the following:

Rule 1. Rules with lower numbers take precedence.
Rule 2. Rules with mediocre numbers take precedence.
Rule 3. Rules with greater numbers take precedence.

Thoughts?

That's certainly a possibility, but not the only one. It could be that what
Wes has is just the original plain text file he (might have) used to compose
the message. At any rate, Wes has carefully avoided clarifying exactly what
the situation is.

Simple answer: yes. I could not have come up with the over 1000 Stems'
worth of currency the Bank currently holds on my own.

I don't forsee any significant devaluation of Denaria since I keep the
redemption standard (0.01 VTs/Denaria) and loan rates (currently 5
Denaria/Currency-Day) constant; since a Denaria can still purchase the
same services, it has a roughly constant value. It is true that it is
not possible for the Bank to make profit from Denaria as things stand.

I suppose that is one way of looking at it, but it seems to me to ignore the
important question of the effects of Denaria availability. If Denaria are
too easy to come by, then Players will be less likely to conduct
transactions with the Bank which are profitable. Consider an analogy: the
range of uses to which apples can be put is by now well known, and does not
depend on whether apples are easy or difficult to come by. Nevertheless,
when apples are scarce, the desirability of possessing such apples as there
are increases, and when they are plentiful, it decreases. This maxim is well
known to the producers of gold, oil and diamonds, all of whom try to stop
the market from becoming flooded with their goods, thus driving the price
down.

Did you say that one can convert Denaria into VTs at a rate of 100 to one? I
hadn't realized that...

I would say "no". You can only break a Rule to the extent that the Rule is
effective in prohibiting your action. In this case, Rule 3 attempts to
prohibit your jumping, but it fails to do so due to the operation of Rules 1
and 2. Perhaps, in the interests of accuracy, we should not speak of
breaking individual Rules, but only of breaking the Rules collectively,
since it is only collectively that we are able to determine what the Rules
allow and what they prohibit.

Again, I must disagree. If the operation of other Rules completely nullified
the effect of R1769, then Wes' publication of the Judgement of CFJ 1183
during a Holiday would not have violated that Rule (or rather, the Rules),
since it would have been ineffective in prohibiting anything.

Logic does not provide the resources to arbitrate among the precedence
claims these Rules make. Each claim is as good as the others. But that
doesn't show that all precedence structures are paradoxical or otherwise
problematic.

A reasonable solution, but several applicable rules seem to disregard
this (e.g., R908 "one or more rules," R1439 "a specific Rule").

Ours can be logically resolved, but that's not my point. Our precedence
structure works because it consists of low-number, high-power rules,
which are the rules they say take precedence, but nothing stops us from
creating high-number, low-power rules that say _they_ are the precedence
structure and that they take precedence over the current precedence
structure. In such a case, the Agoran ruleset becomes only a more
complex version of my example. The precedence structures function only
because they declare themselves to have authority based on their
authority, and that is where the problems lie.

Not necessarily. The existence of a situation where it is literally
impossible to fulful both Rules (namely the possibility of the Holiday
and the ASAP requirement overlapping the exact same time period) does
lend some credence to our argument.

We're not taking it personally, although we were rather annoyed at that
particular post. Mainly because we felt we had just made a rather
convincing argument, logically countering all accusations, and the only
response we got discounted them all without providing an explanation. 
Frustrating, but not a personal attack or anything. You've since more
than made up for it by explaining your position in a very clearly
written expose. ;-)

Hmmm... We imagine we can see that point, but then again, the simple
act of copying the text message into an email client causes it to be
"sent" from one of our storage medium into another. This is an action
which is required to email it, and thus is easily verified. 

On the other hand, it's a moot point in this instance, due to the fact
that the system did automatically cc it to our sent folder. ;-)

You are correct - we were actually quite ill.

Actually, since "Issues" and "Discarding the Chaff" were still in the
Queue at the beginning of that Week (they aren't removed until they
are distributed), when the Batch for that Week was decided, they
were the Proposals included. 

> So this Week's proposals should be "Important Proposals" and "Voodoo".

Incorrect. At the beginning of this Week, when the Batch was calculated,
the Queue contained two Proposals with a higher Priority than either of
those.

We committed an Infraction during the Week beginning on the 20th, due
to the fact that we did not Distribute that Week (we also failed to
Report, if we recall correctly). None since then, though.

No problem there whatsoever. We just wanted a chance to Stay it until
the matter was decided. On the other hand, considering that the consensus
is that even if the Rules make the action technically illegal, yet the
Rules should not have, the Appeals Board could still find the Order
inappropriate. On the other hand, we might draft an "apology" just
for fun anyways. It's a challenge. ;-)

You could always define a value for each Player equal to the number of
+VTs and -VTs combined, then destroy the old VTs, then create a number
of new ones equal to that value, then undefine the value.
