That makes sense.

I have already looked at this type of problem in my intended thesis. It
is already there with two rules:

Rule 1. Rules with lower numbers take precedence
Rule 2. Rules with higher numbers take precedence

Actually, if there is even a case in the current ruleset:

Rule 1584 (Power=2):

     "(...) This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule."

Rule 1482 (Power=3):

     "In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power."

Now, suppose there were a conflict between rule 1584 and a power 3 rule.
Then it would have to be decided which rule takes precedence. Rule 1584
says that it takes precedence, rule 1482 that the other rule takes precedence.
Thus, rules 1584 and 1482 are in conflict. Thus, we have to know which takes
precedence. Rule 1584 says that it takes precedence, rule 1482 that it
does... And so forth. Now, I do not see any Power 3 rule at present allowing
players to vote, make proposals or hold Office, or requiring any duty or
action to players (except the duty to follow the rules, but it has already
been decided by the courts that one would have a duty to follow the rules
even if that duty were not in the rules), but if there ever would be one,
it is undecidable whether or not this allowance or duty would hold for On
Hold players.
