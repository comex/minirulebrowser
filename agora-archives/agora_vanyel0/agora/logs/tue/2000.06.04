Taral is currently Justiciar.

(Main lists seem to be down--I sent this to a-d first and got a
"could not deliver for x hours--will try again later" message.)

Taral was not eligible to Judge CFJ 1219 when it was assigned, and this
did not prevent the selection of three Justices.

But e was only ineligible to Judge due to Rule 1871, which also states
that "Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ." The
Justice selection should have been lee (S), Taral (J), harvel (C).

THE SHORT LOGICAL RULESET



======================================================================
The Game of Agora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name Is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/1 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules currently in
      effect, in the form in which they are currently in effect.
      However, a Player besides the Speaker may always deregister
      rather than continue to play.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
      permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Rules, which is permitted only when the Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permit it.  Any change to the game state which would
      make it impossible to make arbitrary modifications to the Rules
      by any combination of actions by Players does not occur, any
      Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Rules in the Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of
      the first game.  The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116
      (Immutable) and 201-219 (Mutable).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/4 (Power=2)
Definition of Nomic Property

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity the value of
      which is defined by the Rules.  Other Rules may define
      procedures by which the value of a Nomic Property may be
      changed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 754/4 (Power=1)
Spelling, Quoting, and Terminology

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning.  A Player shall not be
      penalised for accurately quoting a Rule, Proposal, Statement,
      Judgement, the words of another Player, or other reference.

      Except when the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have its
      standard mathematical meaning.  In particular, "number" shall
      mean "real number".

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1497/5 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Misrepresentation.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Class 4 Crime
      of Falsification.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of evidence in a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      A Player shall never be convicted of more than one of the above
      Crimes for the same act.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1926/0 (Power=1)
The Official Secrets Act

      The Rules may desingate certain pieces of information to
      be secret. Any player who knowingly reveals secret information
      to another player, except as explicitly permitted or required
      by the rules, commits the Crime of Unlawful Disclosure, a Class
      5 Crime. All secret information is deemed private, with respect
      to the Freedom of Information Act.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1478/4 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e were that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      Only a person or an entity with a Player Executor may perform
      actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1630/3 (Power=1)
Impersonation

      Any Player who knowingly attempts to act as, or purports to be,
      the Executor of an Entity, of which e is not the Executor,
      commits the Class 4 Crime of Impersonation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Definitions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1727/6 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

       "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
        may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
        invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
        published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
        convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official name of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Payroll Clerk shall, on behalf of the
      Bank, submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30
      GMT +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of
      50 Stems each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that Payroll Clerk shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for 25 Stems each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to the
      Contestmaster of each such Contest 100 Stems;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of Appeals,
      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call
      For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge, Judgement,
      call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player Execute an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1586/2 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      No two Rule-defined entities shall have the same name or
      nickname.

      If the Rules defining some entity are repealed or amended
      such that they no longer define that entity, then that
      entity along with all its properties shall cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they
      still define that entity but with different properties,
      that entity and its properties shall continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 478/11 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      announcing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever a Player is required to make any communication
      publicly, this shall be accomplished by sending that
      communication to a Public Forum. Whenever the Rules require a
      Player to "announce" something, said announcement shall be made
      publicly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 459/2 (Power=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
      automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,
      GMT, on the first of the month.  Any automatic change which must
      occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of
      each calendar quarter.

      Other Rules may explicitly define alternate schedules for events
      or classes of events.  Any activity that must be performed at
      least weekly, monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in
      the given period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1274/2 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      An Index (plural: Indices) is a Nomic Property.  The value of an
      Index shall be either a non-negative real number or the special
      value Unanimity.

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1688/1 (Power=3)
Power

      Power is an Index.  An Instrument is an entity with nonzero
      Power.  The Power of a given entity is zero unless otherwise
      defined by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1869/1 (Power=3)
Restrictions on Setting Power

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1023/14 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform an action "as soon
      as possible", then e is required to perform the action within
      a week.

      A Player who fails to observe this requirement commits the
      Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness.  All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a penalty.

      Other Rules may grant extensions of the penalty-free period to
      Inactive Players without conflicting with this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1769/0 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1787/0 (Power=1)
April Fool's Day

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1870/0 (Power=1)
Merry Christmas, Agora

      The period commencing every year at midnight GMT December 25,
      and concluding at midnight GMT January 1 is a Holiday.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1750/0 (Power=1)
Read the Ruleset Week

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1513/4 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      The Rules may grant to certain entities the power to require
      Players to perform (or refrain from performing) actions.  Such
      Entities shall have whatever power is granted to them by the
      Rules.  In the event that the requirements of such an Entity
      conflicts with the Rules, the Rules shall always take
      precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity mentioned
      first in that Rule takes precedence over the others.

      No entity (including any body of text) may require a Player to
      perform or refrain from performing any action unless that
      Player has previously been provided with the information of
      which actions may be required of or prohibited em by that
      entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Players
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/9 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      Any non-Player person may register by sending a message to a
      Public Forum requesting registration.  The person immediately
      becomes a registered Player, unless other Rules provide
      additional necessary conditions for registration which have not
      been fulfilled.

      If that person had ever previously been registered as at least
      one Player (not necessarily concurrently if more than one), then
      e shall become the Player e had been most recently.

      A Player may select a nickname for emself at any time by sending
      a public message to that effect, but e need not do so.  A Player
      should be identified by eir nickname, if e has one.  However,
      any unambiguous method of identification is allowed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1676/4 (Power=1)
Grace Period for New Players

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 12 months prior to this registration, e is subject to
      a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration and
      ends two months afterwards.

      A Player is only subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir
      own registration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1677/7 (Power=1)
Currency Awards for New Players

      As soon as possible after the beginning of a Player's Grace
      Period, the Registrar shall pay out the New Player Award to that
      Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103/1 (Power=3)
The Speaker May Not Deregister

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason,
      any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1016/11 (Power=2)
Putting Oneself On Hold

      At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
      This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
      Rules.

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e announces in the
      Public Forum that e goes On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the
      Public Forum that e comes Off Hold.  E may not do so until at
      least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

      "Active" and "Inactive" are unambiguous synonyms for "Off Hold"
      and "On Hold", respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1584/0 (Power=2)
Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Proposals, make
      Proposals, or hold Office, and cannot be required by the Rules
      to perform any duty or action, unless that Rule specifically
      states that it can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1043/5 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a public message announcing eir deregistration. A Player
      who deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective
      at the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em
      to reregister before thirty days have passed are without effect.
      This Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause em to be
      reregistered before thirty days have passed after eir
      deregistration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1042/14 (Power=1)
Zombification Due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating publicly that e is doing so, and clearly
      identifying that Player.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to become a Zombie by
      stating publicly that the Silent Player has Abandoned the game.
      If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged publicly that e has
      Abandoned the Game, e commits the Class 15 Crime of Speaker
      Abandonment. E ceases to be Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect
      becomes Speaker. E then becomes a Zombie. In either case, the
      Registrar shall, as soon as possible after an public allegation
      that a Player has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny publicly
      that the Player has become a Zombie.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1884/1 (Power=1)
Zombie Masters

      Each Player who is a Zombie has a Master, who owns em.
      When a Player first becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the
      Bank. Zombies may only be transferred from one Master to
      another as explicitly described by the rules.

      If a Player becomes a Zombie's Master, then e is granted
      Power of Attorney for the Zombie, for as long as e remains
      the Zombie's Master. Non-player Zombie Masters are not
      granted Power of Attorney in this way.

      If a Player who owns a Zombie deregisters, all eir Zombies
      become owned by the Bank. The Registrar is required to
      announce this transfer as soon as possible after the
      Player's deregistration, and the transfer takes effect at
      the time it is announced.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1885/1 (Power=1)
Zombie Auctions

      Each week, if there are any Zombies owned by the Bank, for
      which Auctions are not already underway, the Registrar
      shall conduct an Auction for each of those Zombies. The
      Auctioneer for these Auctions shall be the Registrar. The
      Auction Currency is Indulgences, and the Starting Price
      for each Auction is equal to the number of Blots held by
      the Zombie being Auctioned, with a minimum value of one.

      When the Winner of the Auction is announced, e becomes
      the Zombie's new Master. If the Auction ends without a
      winner, then the Zombie is deregistered.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the
      Registrar shall expunge any Blots the Zombie has,
      notifying the Herald of this action.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1886/1 (Power=1)
Returning to Life

      If a Zombie Player becomes Noisy, then e is no longer
      a Zombie, and eir Master ceases to own em.

      Unless the Zombie was owned by the Bank, the Registrar
      shall pay out to the Zombie's most recent Master a number of
      Indulgences equal to the starting price in that Zombie's
      most recent Auction, halved for each new calendar month
      since the end of the Auction. This payment shall be
      made as soon as possible after the Zombie becomes Noisy.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1789/0 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who ey feel have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall post this document to the Public Forum along
      with a Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione,
      commanding the Player to be deregistered and instructing the
      Registrar to note the method of deregistration for that Player
      in subsequent Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains
      deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1755/2 (Power=1)
No Non-Player Responsibilities

      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or Executor of an entity in
      probate, or in general to occupy any role or position to which a
      Rule assigns any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered,
      or who is a Zombie, may occupy such a role or position.  This
      rule takes precedence over rules which would prevent em from
      ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1841/1 (Power=1)
Granting Power of Attorney

      Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more
      months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of
      Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player
      shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving
      Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

      Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public
      Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to,
      and the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.
      To be effective, this post must name a time that begins within
      the week following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not
      be granted unless the Holder is an active Player and consents
      publicly before the beginning of the specified period of time.

      If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power
      of Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall
      end when one of the following occurs;

        i) The period specified expires.
       ii) The Grantor posts publicly that e is withdrawing eir Power
           of Attorney.
      iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
       iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
        v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir
           Power of Attorney to the Holder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1842/0 (Power=1)
Power of Attorney

      In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one
      Player, hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for
      another Player, hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant
      shall only occur when specified by the Rules, and shall last
      only as long as the Rules permit.

      When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor,
      that means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the
      Grantor for as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

      No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than
      two other Players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Officers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/8 (Power=1)
Definition of Office

      An Office is a position so designated by the Rules.

      Each Office is always held by exactly one Player (called an
      Officer).  Each Office shall be held by the Speaker unless
      otherwise specified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1686/5 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate certain information to
      be part of the corresponding Officer's Weekly Report or Monthly
      Report.  Any information designated to be part of the Officer's
      Report but not explicitly designated part of the Monthly Report
      shall be part of the Weekly Report.  If no information is
      designated to be part of the Weekly (or Monthly) Report, then
      that Office has no Weekly (or, respectively, Monthly) Report.

      Each Officer's Report is an Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report.  E shall post the
      Weekly Report at least once each Nomic Week and the Monthly
      Report at least once each month.  Failure to post the Weekly
      Report (if there is one) in a Nomic Week or the Monthly Report
      (if there is one) in a month is the Class 2 Infraction of
      Failure to Report.  The Payroll Clerk and the Speaker are
      authorized to detect and report this Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1064/8 (Power=1)
Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class 2 Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1431/12 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a public message to the effect that a
      specific post to the Public Forum misrepresents the actual Game
      State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error posting publicly either a denial
      of the Claim or an admission of the Claim. If the Claim is
      admitted, then the Player making the admission is required to
      post a corrected version of the relevant portion of the message
      which was in error, before one week passes from the time the
      Claim of Error was made. A Player who admits a Claim but does
      not publish a correction is deemed not to have Responded to that
      Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Delayed COE Response, to be
      reported by the Player who posted the Claim. A Player who
      incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim commits the Crime of
      Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the
      Claim within 72 hours after the incorrect denial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1550/2 (Power=1)
Ratification

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1791/0 (Power=1)
Ratification Without Objection

      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

        i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
           permissible to Ratify.
       ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
           holding the Office.
      iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
           produced and maintained by the Officer.

      A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official
      Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally
      permissible to Ratify.

      A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by
      the Rules to constitute an Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1552/2 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criterion.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

Rule 1919/1 (Power=2)
Installing Officers through Proposal

      A Player may be Installed into an Office by the adoption of a
      Democratic Proposal. If that Office is already held by a Player,
      that Player is removed from the Office. The Player named in the
      Proposal then becomes the Electee to that Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1555/5 (Power=1)
Electees and Removal from Offices

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office, or by virtue of being installed
      in that Office through a Proposal, is called the Electee
      to that Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become
      the temporary of that Office.

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, is deregistered, or
      becomes a Zombie, e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1556/2 (Power=1)
Terms of Service for Offices

      Unless otherwise specified, the Term of Service for an Office
      shall expire on the first day of the fourth month following the
      month in which the Officer in question was elected to that
      Office.  At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service, the
      Officer holding that Office shall be retired from that Office.

      Other Rules may specify a different Term of Service for specific
      Offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1758/3 (Power=1)
Holding an Office in Perpetuity

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,
      then the Payroll Clerk may declare Without Objection that that
      Player holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office. If a
      Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office to
      another Player, then, if e resumes holding the Office in the
      normal fashion at the end of the Period of Delegation, e also
      resumes holding the Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 880/6 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds.

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the
      named successor agrees publicly to be successor to the Office,
      the named successor becomes holder of the Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1645/5 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
      that Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is
      called Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein
      referred to as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed
      is herein referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted publicly a Notice of
            Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated and the
            Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 790/8 (Power=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Payroll Clerk shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Payroll Clerk; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1486/6 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach an Officer

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by publicly requesting such.
      The Officer is Impeached when such a Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voters do not include the Officer
      under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must be
      greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1644/4 (Power=1)
Dereliction of Duty

      A Player who:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official
            Report, and
      (ii)  fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report
            for that Office

      commits the Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of Duty.
      Additionally, such a Player is removed from said Office.

      The Payroll Clerk is the Officer authorized to detect and report
      the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
      other than the Payroll Clerk. The Clerk of the Courts is the
      Officer authorized to detect and report the commission of the
      Infraction of Dereliction of Duty by the Payroll Clerk.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1905/0 (Power=1)
The Cabinet

      The set of Players consisting of the Speaker and all current
      Electees to Offices is called the Cabinet.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1665/2 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class 4
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 1061 (Judged TRUE, Nov. 2 1997): "Rule 1585 should be interpreted
 such that a Player who is newly installed into an Office does not
 commit the Infraction of Failure to Report (insofar as that Office is
 subject to such duties) if e posts the required Report within a week
 of eir being installed into Office."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1553/2 (Power=1)
Officer Transition

      Whenever a Player ceases to hold an Office, that Player shall
      make a reasonable effort to ensure that all materials necessary
      for the conduct of that Office, including any records the holder
      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to
      the next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who fails to do
      so violates this Rule, and commits the Class 4 Crime of Improper
      Officer Transition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1728/8 (Power=1)
Dependent Actions

      An action is Dependent (or may be performed Dependently) if
      and only if it is an Action With N Objections or an Action
      With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer not greater
      than five.  The phrase `Without Objection' is synonymous with
      `Without 1 Objection', and the phrase `With Support' is
      synonymous with `With 1 Supporter'.  The Rules may authorise
      classes of Dependent Actions.

      A Player may, in a Public Forum, unambiguously describe a
      particular Dependent Action which e is authorised by the
      Rules to perform Dependently, and announce eir intent to
      perform it.  That Player may perform that action if and only if:

      (a)  e announced eir intent at most fourteen days before
            attempting to perform it, and, in the case of Actions
            Without N Objections, at least four days before attempting
            to perform it;

      (b)  the authorising Rule explicitly indicates who may perform
           the action Dependently;

      (c)  during the time between the announcement made under
           (a) of this Rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  fewer than N Players have publicly posted Objections
                to the performance of the action, if the action is to
                be performed Without N Objections; or

           (2)  at least N Players have publicly posted Support for
                the performance of the action, if the action is to be
                performed With N Supporters; and

      (d)  e publicly announces that e performs the described action.

      Properties which would be changed by a Dependent Action
      do not occur until announced as in (d).

      The specification in the Rules that an action may be
      performed Dependently in no way prohibits performing that
      same action if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      Other Rules may specify further restrictions upon the
      performance of Dependent Actions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1664/14 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
      always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch from
      Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding if e has not
      does so during the current month by sending a public message
      saying e does change so. The Registrar shall include in the
      Registrar's Report a list of all Players that are Rebellious.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by publicly saying
      e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective if the following
      conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the Public
      Forum.

      The Registar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held) at the time of the Call
      for Revolt.  If this number is less than or equal to the number
      of Rebellious Players (plus 1 if Miscreant is held by a
      Rebellious Player), then the Revolt succeeds; otherwise it
      fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in
      order):

         - The Registrar shall expunge all Blots of each Rebellious
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 40 Stems to each Rebellious
           Player.
         - All positions in the Oligarchy become vacant.
         - All Abiding Players that hold one or more Offices in the
           normal fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and
           hold them temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again
         - The Herald is empowered and required to levy a tax of
           75% on indulgences. The holder of the Patent Title
           "Robespierre" is exempt from this tax, even if other rules
           don't allow tax exemptions.
         - A Speaker Transition occurs

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all Blots that have
      been gained or expunged as a result of this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1840/1 (Power=1)
Inciting to Riot

      At the beginning of each Month, all Rebellious players commit
      the Class 2 Infraction of Inciting to Riot, to be reported by
      the Registrar.

Rule 1892/3 (Power=1)
The Treasuror

      There exists the Office of Treasuror, whose responsibility it is
      to maintain the Budget.

      The Treasuror's Monthly Report shall include, for each
      Currency:

        (i)  its name;
       (ii)  its Mintor;
      (iii)  its Recordkeepor;
       (iv)  its MUQ; and
        (v)  whether it is (and if so, when it became) a Basic
             Currency.

      Each Nominee for Treasuror shall submit a valid Proto-Budget
      during the Nomination Period, or else eir Nomination shall
      automatically be withdrawn at the end of the Nomination Period.
      A Proto-Budget is valid if it would be valid as a Budget.

      When the Voting Period for Treasuror begins, the Vote Collector
      shall announce each Candidate's last valid Proto-Budget.

      When the Voting Period for Treasuror ends, the Winner's last
      valid Proto-Budget becomes the Budget, and e shall announce it
      as soon as possible.  If the Election ends without a Winner,
      then the existing Budget remains in effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1893/7 (Power=1)
The Treasuror's Budget

      The Treasuror's Budget (Budget) shall contain the Basic Officer
      Salary (BOS), an amount between 0 and 200 Stems inclusive.
      Additionally, the Budget shall contain the values of the
      following compensations:

          *  the New Player Award;
          *  the Minimum Income;
          *  the Judicial Salary;
          *  the Distributor's Gratuity;
          *  the Speaker's Gratuity; and
          *  for each wage-earning Office, the Salary of that Office.

      A compensation shall be not less than 0 nor more than 4, and
      must be an integral multiple of 0.1.  The arithmetic mean of all
      compensations shall be no greater than 2.

      Whenever the Rules indicate that one of the above compensations
      shall be paid out, the amount to be paid out shall be the
      product of the value of the compensation and the value of the
      BOS (as set in the latest Budget).

      The Treasuror may, With Support, amend the Budget, so long as
      the amendment would not make the Budget invalid and the
      Treasuror does not hold the Office temporarily.

      If the current Budget is invalid, then the Treasuror shall
      create a valid one as soon as possible.  This valid one should
      be as close as as possible to the most recent valid version of
      the Budget.  The Treasuror shall then post this Budget to a
      Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1940/0 (Power=1)
Periodic Compensations

      The Rules may designate certain compensations to be periodic
      compensations.  As soon as possible after the beginning of each
      month, each periodic compensation required to be paid out shall
      be paid out by the Officer required to do so.

      The Minimum Income, the Distributor's Gratuity, the Speaker's
      Gratuity, and the Salary for each wage-earning Office are
      periodic compensations.

      The Payroll Clerk shall pay out the Minimum Income to each
      Player, and shall further pay out to each Player the designated
      Salary for each Office that Player held for at least 12 days of
      the previous month.

      The Registrar shall pay out the Distributor's Gratuity to the
      Distributor if the Distributor is a Player and was both the
      Distributor and a Player for at least 12 days of the previous
      month.

      The Registrar shall pay out the Speaker's Gratuity to a Player
      if that Player was Speaker for the whole of the previous month.

======================================================================
The Oligarchy
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1932/0 (Power=2)
The Oligarchy

      The Oligarchy is a set of six positions which are filled by
      Players, who are called Oligarchs. No Player may ever occupy
      more than one position in the Oligarchy at any one time.

      The Oligarchy is divided into three ranks: High, Middle and Low.
      There is one High Oligarch, two Middle Oligarchs and three Low
      Oligarchs.

      The Speaker may never be an Oligarch. If an Oligarch becomes
      Speaker, e immediately ceases to be an Oligarch and eir position
      in the Oligarchy becomes vacant.

      If an Oligarch ceases to be a Player, is On Hold, is a Zombie,
      or has three or more Blots, e ceases to be an Oligarch and eir
      position in the Oligarchy becomes vacant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1936/1 (Power=2)
Auctioning Positions in the Oligarchy

      Whenever an Auction is conducted to fill a position or positions
       in the Oligarchy, the standard Auction procedure is used, with
       the following additions and exceptions:

      (a) Auction Currency: the Auction Currency is Voting Tokens;
      (b) Bidders: neither the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect, nor any
          Oligarch may bid;
      (c) Cancelling Bids: if a Player ceases to be a Player, goes
          On Hold, becomes a Zombie, or becomes an Oligarch during
          the Auction, all eir bids in the Auction are cancelled.
      (d) Winning Bids: when the Auctions ends, the winning bids are
          the N largest uncancelled bids made by different Players
          who are not Oligarchs. If simultaneous Auctions are being
          held for positions in different ranks of the Oligarchy,
          then the winning bids are the N largest uncancelled bids
          made by different Players who are neither Oligarchs nor
          have made a winning bid in an Auction for a higher ranking
          position in the Oligarchy.
      (e) Defaulting: a winning bidder has one week from the
          time e is billed by the Auctioneer for eir winning bid in
          which to pay the bill. If the bill remains unpaid for more
          than a week, then the winning bidder is considered to have
          defaulted. In that case, the Auctioneer shall vacate the
          bill, penalise the defaulting bidder 2 Blots, and conduct a
          fresh Auction for that position. Other winning bidders in
          the same Auction who have not defaulted are not affected.

      A winning Bidder fills the position in the Oligarchy for which e
      bid when the Payment Order executed by the Auctioneer billing em
      for eir bid in the Auction is satisfied.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1937/1 (Power=2)
Filling Vacancies in the Oligarchy

      Vacancies in the Oligarchy are filled as follows, in order.

      1) If there is no High Oligarch:

         a) The Low Oligarchs select a Middle Oligarch to become High
            Oligarch.
         b) If there are no Low Oligarchs, then the Speaker selects a
            Middle Oligarch to become High Oligarch.
         c) If there are no Middle Oligarchs, then the Speaker selects
            a Low Oligarch to become High Oligarch.
         d) If there are no Middle Oligarchs or Low Oligarchs, then
            the Speaker conducts three Auctions:  one for High
            Oligarch, one for the two Middle Oligarchs, and one for as
            many Low Oligarch positions for which no Auction is
            already in progress.

      2) If a Middle Oligarch position is vacant:

         a) The High Oligarch selects a Low Oligarch to become a
            Middle Oligarch.
         b) If there are no Low Oligarchs, then the High Oligarch
	    conducts a single Auction for L+M positions in the
	    Oligarchy, where L and M are, respectively, the number of
	    vacant Low and Middle Oligarch positions for which no
	    Auction is already in progress. The High Oligarch then
	    selects M of the new Oligarchs to be Middle Oligarchs.

      3) If a Low Oligarch position is vacant:

         a) The High Oligarch conducts an Auction for the number of
            Low Oligarchy positions for which no Auction is already in
            progress.

      For the purposes of this Rule, an Auction for a position or
      positions in the Oligarchy is 'in progress' from the time the
      Auction starts until either the positions are filled, or one
      week has passed from the latest time at which the Auctioneer
      billed any of the winning bidders in the Auction for eir winning
      bid, whichever comes first.

      Any selection required by this Rule must be announced within
      three days. A Player may not change eir selection once e has
      announced it.

      A Player required to make selection who fails to do so within
      three days commits the Class 2 Infraction of Oligardiness, which
      any Player may detect and report.

      Selections performed by two or more Oligarchs are by majority
      vote.

      If a single Oligarch who is required to make a selection fails
      to do so, or if a selection to be performed by majority vote
      does not produce a decisive result within three days, then the
      Oligarchs' selections (if any) are cancelled and the Speaker is
      required to make the selection instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1938/0 (Power=1)
Monthly Rotation in the Oligarchy

      If the same Player has been High Oligarch continuously for four
      weeks, then at the beginning of the next Nomic Week, the
      position of High Oligarch becomes vacant.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Making Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1925/0 (Power=1)
Legislative Status

      Legislative Status is a Nomic Property which may consist of one
      or more of the values Legislator, Voter or Barred. Each Player
      has a Legislative Status. Other entities may possess a
      Legislative Status if and only if the Rules explicitly permit
      them to. If an entity has a Legislative Status without a value,
      then it shall be given the value Barred. The Registrar shall
      record the Legislative Status of each Player.

      Players have a Legislative Status of both Legislator and Voter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/7 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute sends a
      body of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication that
      it is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text
      becomes a Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes
      the Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as
      Proposing or submitting a Proposal.

      The delivery of text identical to another Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previous does not create a
      new Proposal unless accompanied by a clear and explicit
      indication that the intent was to Propose a duplicate Proposal.

      The publishing of the Proposal Queue never creates new
      Proposals.

      All Players are Legislators.  A Player is Mute while e has more
      than 5 Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107/1 (Power=3)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in valid media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.  For
      the purposes of this rule, print and electronic media, including
      mailing lists, are valid media.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 404/2 (Power=2)
Legality of Proposals

      No Rule shall have any effect which seeks to make the legality
      of making a Proposal conditional upon its content.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1623/11 (Power=1)
Disinterested Proposals

      A Proposal may be Interested or Disinterested. Each Proposal is
      Interested when made. The Proposer of a Proposal may cause it to
      become Disinterested, without objection, but only if the
      Proposal has not yet been distributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1723/5 (Power=1)
Sanity

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested.

       iii) The Proposal is Democratic.

      A Sane Proposal has its Priority Cost increased by 1.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voters may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voters to vote on Sane Proposals, or which would
      allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1724/5 (Power=1)
Urgent Proposals

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested.

      An Urgent Proposal has its Priority Cost increased by 0.5.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days, and
      furthermore the Proposal may be distributed by the Promotor
      immediately without waiting for the next scheduled Batch to
      be distributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1607/7 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      There exists the Office of Promotor, whose responsibility it is
      to receive and distribute Proposals, and to be the Recordkeepor
      for Proposal Notes.

      The Promotor's Report shall include the following information
      for each Proposal in the Proposal Queue:

        (i)  its Title;
       (ii)  its time of submission;
      (iii)  its Priority, and any changes thereto since the last
             posting of the Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1036/13 (Power=1)
The Proposal Queue

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are listed
      in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer. All Proposals initially
      have a Priority of zero.

      A Proposal's Priority Cost is an integer multiple of the MUQ
      of P-Notes.  The base Priority Cost for a Proposal is 1, but
      this may be altered by other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1839/4 (Power=1)
The Promotor Can Change the Batch Size

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between one and four
      inclusive, indicating the number of Interested Proposals which
      will be distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Intereseted Proposals in the
      Queue. Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is
      five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      publicly announcing the new value, provided that e announces a
      value between one and four inclusive, that e makes the
      announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has not
      already made such an announcement earlier in the Week.  As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1770/11 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      The Current Batch for a given Week is a subset of the Proposal
      Queue.  Its contents shall be calculated at the beginning of
      that Week.  It shall contain every Disinterested Proposal then
      in the Proposal Queue, as well as:

          * all Interested Proposals in the Proposal Queue with
            Priority greater than zero, if their number is not
            greater than the Batch Size; or

          * a set of Interested Proposals in the Proposal Queue
            with the highest positive Priority the cardinality
            of which is equal to the Batch Size.  Ties for
            highest Priority shall be broken in favor of those
            Proposals which have been in the Queue the longest.

      During a Week, the Promotor must distribute all and only
      Proposals in that Week's Current Batch.  Failure to Distribute
      all Proposals in that Current Batch during that Week is the
      Class 0.5 Infraction of Promotor Tardiness.  All Players are
      authorized to detect and report this Infraction.  Knowingly and
      willfully distributing a Proposal (or text purporting to be a
      Proposal) not in the Current Batch is the Class 2 Crime of
      Promotor Misrepresentation.  All Players are authorized to
      detect and report this Crime.

      A Player may make a Claim of Error stating that a distributed
      Proposal was not in the Current Batch at the time it was
      distributed.  If this is admitted, then:

          * the Voting Period for that Proposal shall immediately
            end;
          * all Votes cast on that Proposal shall be cancelled;
            and
          * the Promotor shall add the Proposal to the Proposal
            Queue.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its number, the identity of its
      Proposing Entity, and an indication of whether the Proposal is
      Ordinary or Democratic.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

      Immediately after all Proposals in the Current Batch have
      been distributed the Promotor shall reduce the Priority of all
      Proposals remaining in the Queue to half of their previous
      values, rounding fractions down.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1771/7 (Power=1)
Changing Priority

      A Player may increase the Priority of a Proposal in the
      Queue by stating publicly the integer amount by which the
      Priority is to be increased and Paying a Fee equal to the
      number of P-Notes equal to the amount of the increase multiplied
      by the Priority Cost of the Proposal (rounded up to the nearest
      multiple of the MUQ of P-Notes).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1772/0 (Power=1)
Promotor's Privilege

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1774/2 (Power=1)
Discarding Proposals from the Queue

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
      which has zero or negative Priority and has been in the Queue
      for more than two weeks, then the Promotor may, at eir
      discretion, remove this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove that
      Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor that e
      does so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1003/2 (Power=2)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience shall not take effect even if
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Voting on Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1449/11 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      There exists the Office of Assessor, whose responsibility it is
      to receive and announce the results of Votes on Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/1 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if
      it receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is
      achieved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 693/6 (Power=1)
Prescribed Voting Period

      The Voting Period for a Proposal is seven days, beginning when
      the Proposal is distributed.  Other Rules may specify other
      lengths of Voting Periods for particular classes of Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1726/0 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its Execution, it takes effect when Executed.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1933/1 (Power=2)
Ordinary and Democratic Proposals

      An Ordinary Proposal is a Proposal on which only Oligarchs are
      permitted to vote. While a Proposal is an Ordinary Proposal, all
      non-Oligarchs are Denied for that Proposal.

      A Democratic Proposal is a Proposal on which all Voters are
      permitted to vote to the extent that other Rules permit them to
      do so.

      Unless another Rule with Power greater than or equal to 2 says
      otherwise, a Proposal with an Adoption Index of less than two is
      Ordinary, and a Proposal with an Adoption Index of two or
      greater is Democratic.

      However, any Proposal distributed while there are no Oligarchs
      is Democratic, even if its Adoption Index is less than two.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1934/1 (Power=2)
The Speaker and Democratic Proposals

      The Speaker may change a Proposal which would otherwise be an
      Ordinary Proposal into a Democratic Proposal, with three
      Supporters, provided that that the Voting Period for the
      Proposal has not yet concluded (the change may occur before the
      Voting Period commences).

      If a Proposal changes from being an Ordinary Proposal to being a
      Democratic Proposal during its Voting Period, then all votes
      which were cast on the Proposal prior to the change are
      cancelled, and its Voting Period is extended to end seven days
      after it became a Democratic Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1935/0 (Power=1)
Voting by the Oligarchy

      Subject to the qualifications below, the High Oligarch must cast
      three votes, a Middle Oligarch two votes, and a Low Oligarch one
      vote, on any Ordinary Proposal on which e votes at all.

      A Player who becomes an Oligarch during the Voting Period of an
      Ordinary Proposal may not vote on that Proposal (unless the
      Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal). An Oligarch who
      changes rank during the Voting Period of an Ordinary Proposal
      must cast as many votes as the lower rank entitles em to cast,
      if e casts any votes at all on that Proposal (again, this
      provision applies only as long the Proposal remains an Ordinary
      Proposal).

      Multiple votes cast by an Oligarch on an Ordinary Proposal must
      be either all FOR or all AGAINST. Oligarchs may not declare
      Presence on an Ordinary Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 206/17 (Power=2)
Voters

      An entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal if and only if e is
      a Voter and is not Denied for that Proposal at the time e
      attempts to cast eir vote.

      On a Democratic Proposal, each entity which is permitted to vote
      on that Proposal may cast a number of votes up to their Maximum
      Votes as shown in the most recently published Accountor's Report
      at the time that the Proposal is distributed, unless other Rules
      prohibit them from doing so. If the Maximum Votes for a Voter
      have never been published at the time a Proposal is distributed,
      their Maximum Votes is 5 for that Proposal.

      All Players are Voters. However, a Player is Denied for all
      Proposals while e has more than 3 Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1824/3 (Power=1)
Debt Voting

      At the beginning of each week, all entities that are the Payors
      of at least one Overdue Payment Order originally executed for
      the purpose of billing that entity for Votes on Proposals,
      commit the Infraction of Debt Voting.  This Infraction shall be
      reported by the Accountor, and shall bear the penalty of the
      being Denied for all Proposals for a period of two weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/9 (Power=1)
Voting on Proposals

      A Voter authorised to cast votes on a particular Proposal may do
      so only by informing the Assessor of the vote or votes e is
      casting on that Proposal. Once cast, a vote cannot be changed or
      cancelled by the Voter which cast it, although it may be
      cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by an entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1715/6 (Power=1)
Announcing One's Presence

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on an Issue which is not
      an Ordinary Proposal by sending a message to that effect to the
      Issue's Vote Collector. Solely for the purpose of determining
      Quorum, this Player is considered to have voted on that Issue.
      If e also casts a Vote on that Issue, e is counted only once
      toward Quorum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1764/9 (Power=1)
Modes of Voting

      There are three classes of Issues: Proposals, Elections, and
      Referenda.

      (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
          Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the
          prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.

      (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
               for Proposals, with Support.

           (2) The Payroll Clerk may change the prevailing mode of
               voting for Elections, with Support.

           (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

      (c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of
          voting for that particular Issue is permanently set to the
          prevailing mode for that class of Issue.

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voters on that
               Issue, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
               Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may only be achieved by sending a
               message privately to the Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may be achieved by sending a message
               either publically or privately.

      (e) If the mode of voting is Private or Unrestricted, then the
          status of any votes cast privately is secret until the
          end of the voting period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1729/2 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should at the end, Votes FOR plainly lack,
      The wicked Proposer shall be Maniac.

CFJ 1178, Judged TRUE Nov. 18 1999: "Rule 1729 permits voting on
Insane Proposals by private message to the Assessor, even when the
prevailing mode of voting on Proposals is Public."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1717/6 (Power=1)
The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue which is not an
      Ordinary Proposal, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by
      publicly stating so. An Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

      Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
      Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
      cancelled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The End of the Voting Period
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 879/12 (Power=2)
Quorum

      Quorum for an Ordinary Proposal is achieved if three Oligarchs
      cast votes on the Proposal.

      Quorum for a Democratic Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast
      on the Proposal by one-third of Active Players who are not
      Denied on that Proposal, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever
      is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated at the beginning of the
      prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal, using information
      current at that time. However, if an Ordinary Proposal becomes a
      Democratic Proposal during its Voting Period (or vice versa),
      then Quorum is recalculated at the time of the change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/2 (Power=1)
End of the Voting Period

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period on a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast
      upon that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 955/5 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1322/3 (Power=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 108/1 (Power=3)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 376/4 (Power=1)
When Proposals Take Effect

      A Proposal which is Adopted takes effect at the time date-
      stamped on the first message sent by the Assessor to reach
      the Public Forum announcing the results of the voting on that
      Proposal.

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in the order in which they were distributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1891/0 (Power=1)
Legislative Orders

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1561/1 (Power=2)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1690/0 (Power=1)
Power of New Rules

      The Power of a new Rule shall be as specified by the instrument
      which causes the creation of that Rule; if no such specification
      exists, the Power of the new Rule shall be 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1349/0 (Power=2)
Rule Numbering

      The Rulekeepor shall give each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created.  The Number of a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than all other Numbers previously given to
      a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
      have been incorrectly enacted), or 301, whichever is greater.

      Once a Rule has been given a Rule Number, it shall not be
      changed except as specified in the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1069/1 (Power=1)
Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a
      Rule having that Rule Number has been amended. The default
      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value
      of the Amendment Number of every Rule unless it is specified by
      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
      Rule and the Rule's current text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 947/15 (Power=1)
Bonus for Repeal

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 30 Stems to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 30 Stems
      to the Proposal's Proposer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1678/4 (Power=1)
Encourage Proposals by New Players

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 60 Stems,
      over and above any other award that Player might also receive
      for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over Rules that
      would prevent this award.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1583/2 (Power=1)
Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players

      All penalties that are a direct result of voting on Proposals
      are halved if the penalties are being applied to a Player during
      that Player's Grace Period.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining to
      penalties that are a direct result of voting.

======================================================================
Referenda and Elections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1434/6 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for
      collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      Unless otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Vote
      Collector.

      * Voters: Only Active Players may Vote on a Referendum.
      Activity is measured at the time a Player sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting,
      at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those Players who
      have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the
      Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption Index
      for a Referendum is 1.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voters
      at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller fraction
      voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1445/12 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
      nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing
      the result.  Unless otherwise specified, the Speaker at the
      time the Referendum starts shall be the Vote Collector.

      If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered before the
      Voting Period ends, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nominator: Each Active, Immaculate Player may Nominate emself
      in an Election.  On Hold status and number of Blots are measured
      at the time a Player makes or attempts to make a Nomination.

      * Nomination: A Nominator makes a Nomination by sending a
      message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period
      indicating for which Election e is Nominating.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the
      Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to retract eir
      Nomination.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
      Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for the
      Election.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
      Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside of
      the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * Announcing Candidates : the Vote Collector shall announce to
      the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
      Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the
      Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
      Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
      standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
      exceptions :

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
      Candidates for the given Election. Words which are effectively
      synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most votes were cast. If there is more than one such
      candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those candidates as the
      winner, and must announce eir chosen candidate as winner to the
      Public Forum.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is
      not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, the Election has no Winner.

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1558/3 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections for Offices

      When the Rules require that an Election be conducted to fill
      an Office, that Election shall be conducted in accordance with
      the usual Rules for Elections, with the following exceptions:

      * The Vote Collector of the Election shall be the Payroll Clerk,
        unless the Office which the Election is seeking to fill is
        that of the Payroll Clerk, in which case the Vote Collector
        shall be the Speaker; and

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted
        Nomination, would not be permitted to hold the Office which
        the Election is seeking to fill.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1835/0 (Power=1)
Standing Down

      During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
      Election may stand down, by posting a message to the Public
      Forum to that effect. The player is then no longer to be
      considered a Candidate for that Election. Any further votes
      cast in eir favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

      When a player stands down, e has the option of transferring all
      votes so far cast for em to another Candidate in the Election,
      if one exists. To do so, e must explicitly state which Candidate
      e is transferring eir votes to, in the same message as the
      announcement that e is standing down. Any votes transferred in
      this fashion will be considered to be cast for the receiving
      Candidate.

      This rule takes precedence over other rules for determining the
      Winner of an Election.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1659/3 (Power=1)
The Right to Call Elections

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right to call Elections.
      This is the Right to declare any number of Offices to be held
      temporarily.  This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  If the Speaker
      posts such a message, is not Tainted at the time of posting, and
      has not exercised this Right since e last became Speaker, the
      Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to
      those Offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1626/3 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Class 4 Crime of Application Fraud.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Orders
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1793/0 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1798/1 (Power=1)
I Was Only Obeying Orders

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid shall not be convicted of a Crime, nor
      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause
      the Player to be convicted of a Crime or penalized, as
      described, for said action.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1794/2 (Power=1)
Classes of Orders

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals.
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
          following positions shall be considered an Officer when
          performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
          by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Executor of an entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1795/3 (Power=1)
Timing Requirements of Orders

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      Other Rules may establish other times by which Orders must be
      performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1797/1 (Power=1)
Abuse of Authority

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class 10 Crime of Abuse of Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1799/1 (Power=1)
Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended,
      stayed, or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate
      Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer
      Order may be amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who
      executed it only during the time in which it is delayed.
      Certain classes of Orders may be amended, stayed, or vacated in
      other circumstances as well, when the Rules so allow.  In all
      cases, this is done by an Order to Amend, Stay, or Vacate,
      respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1800/0 (Power=1)
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1801/0 (Power=1)
Stay of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
      expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
      which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
      made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1802/0 (Power=1)
Vacation of Orders

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1808/1 (Power=1)
Administrative and Private Orders

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them to the Player to
      be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1809/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of Administrative and Private Orders

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1810/2 (Power=1)
Noncompliance with Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.

      If an Order requires an entity to perform an action prior to a
      specified time, and the Order is not satisfied prior to that
      time specified in the Order commits the Class 4 Crime of
      Contempt by Inaction.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1811/1 (Power=1)
Contempt by Action

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Class 4 Crime of Contempt by
      Action.

      This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
      which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
      the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
      under this Rule.

Rule 889/10 (Power=1)
The Clerk of the Courts

      There exists the Office of Clerk of the Courts, whose
      responsibility it is to oversee the judicial system.

      The Monthly Report of the Clerk of the Courts shall include the
      Stare Decisis, which is a list of past Calls for Judgement
      (CFJs). The following information shall be included for each
      CFJ:

        (i)  its statement;
       (ii)  the date on which it was called;
      (iii)  its outcome (if any) on Judgement; and
       (iv)  its outcome (if any) on Appeal.

      Whenever a CFJ is made, the Clerk shall add it to the list.  E
      may, at eir discretion, add earlier CFJs.  E may, Without
      Objection, remove any CFJ from the list that e deems no longer
      relevant.

Calling for Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/3 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any Player who seeks formal resolution of any dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic shall be permitted to request such by submitting a
      Call for Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts.  For the purpose
      of this and other Rules, the submission of a Call for Judgement
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a Call for Judgement,
      along with any additional material submitted by the Caller
      (including, but not limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not
      later than the time e announces the identity of the first Judge
      assigned to Judge it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1831/0 (Power=1)
Filing a CFJ with the Justiciar

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 897/2 (Power=1)
Barring Players from Judgement

      The Caller of a CFJ may Bar up to three Players from Judging
      that CFJ.

      Any Player whose Executor is the Caller of a CFJ is Barred from
      Judging that CFJ.

      Any Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that
      CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1562/5 (Power=1)
Excess CFJs

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      A Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Class 1
      Infraction of Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the
      Courts.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ.  Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Class 2 Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing,
      to be reported by the Justiciar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Selecting a Judge
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1868/1 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This selection
      shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible to serve
      as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once selected as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is Recused from that CFJ or becomes
      ineligible to Judge that particular CFJ.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

CFJ 1186, Judged TRUE Dec. 9 1999: "The Clerk of the Courts is
required by Rule 1868 to select a Judge who is eligible at the time
that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
eligible at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 698/5 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to Judge a given CFJ unless
      specifically made ineligible by some Rule.

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to Judge that CFJ.

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding
      the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall
      be eligible.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of Rules
      which would result in there being no Players eligible to Judge a
      given CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1871/0 (Power=1)
Turns for All

      Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes
      ineligible to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no
      Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then all Players made
      ineligible by this rule become eligible again.

      Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
      a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1567/9 (Power=1)
Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ or type of CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the
      Courts, specifying the CFJ or type of CFJ for which e wishes to
      be made ineligible.  Such a notice remains in effect until the
      Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no longer in
      effect.

      If a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge of a CFJ for
      which e has already been selected as Judge, e commits the Class
      0.1 Infraction of Shirking Judgeship, to be reported by the
      CotC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1568/5 (Power=1)
Judges On Hold

      Any Player who goes on Hold while selected as the Judge of one
      or more CFJs commits the Infraction of Judge Inactivity.  This
      Infraction is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts, and has
      a penalty of 0.1 Indulgences times the number of CFJs for which
      the Player was selected as Judge when e went On Hold.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1756/2 (Power=1)
Delinquent Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Class 2 Infraction
      of Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the CotC.

Delivering Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 408/13 (Power=1)
Requirement to Judge or Dismiss

      The Deliberation Period for any particular CFJ begins when
      the Clerk of the Courts announces the identity of the Judge
      and ends seven days later.

      At any point after the end of the Deliberation Period for
      a particular CFJ, if the Judge has not yet returned
      Judgement or Dismissed that CFJ, then the Clerk of the Courts
      may Recuse that Judge from the case and assign a new one as
      usual. If this occurs, then the Recused Judge shall commit
      the Class 3 Infraction of Judging Late, detected and reported
      by the Clerk of the Courts, and shall furthermore be
      ineligible to Judge any future CFJ's until such time as e
      requests to be made eligible again by publicly posting such a
      request.

      Seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period, the
      Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ and commits the
      Infraction of Judging Late as described elsewhere in this
      Rule.

      If the Judge returned a Judgement or Dismisses that CFJ
      after the end of the Deliberation Period but before being
      Recused as Judge, then e shall commit the Infraction of
      Judging a Bit Late, a Class 0.2 Infraction to be detected
      and Reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 591/16 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgement to the Clerk of
      the Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or
      FALSE.  Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      If a Judge delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period, then the Clerk of the
      Courts shall pay out to the Judge the Judicial Salary as
      soon as possible after the publication of eir Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1575/4 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  A Player shall not be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1768/0 (Power=1)
Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 451/3 (Power=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1565/7 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 20
      Stems.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 502/6 (Power=1)
Salary for Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1803/0 (Power=1)
Judicial Orders

      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1804/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of Judicial Orders

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.

      The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
      improperly or invalidly executed, order that that Order be
      amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1826/0 (Power=1)
Motions

      A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
      CFJ.

      A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
      possible after receiving it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1827/2 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within seven days
      of when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, e
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Slow Motion, detected
      and reported by the Clerk of the Courts. If this occurs,
      the Clerk of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign
      a new one as usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is no longer a Player or is On Hold, then
      a new Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1828/1 (Power=1)
Motions Requesting Judicial Orders

      Any Player may formally request a Judge issue any Judicial Order
      by filing a motion requesting that Order.  If granted, the Judge

Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1829/1 (Power=1)
Refusal of Duty by the Speaker

      If the Speaker is convicted of the Crime of Contempt by

      directed at the position of Speaker, the Speaker becomes
      Tainted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 789/5 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate Rules

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated.  The Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate
      a Rule Without Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be
      modified in any way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1500/6 (Power=1)
Orders to Annotate SLCs

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      if the SLC ceases to exist; if required to do so by a valid
      Order; or if the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed,
      or vacated.  The Maintainer of an SLC may vacate an Order to
      annotate that SLC Without Objection.  Annotations to an SLC may
      not be modified in any way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

Rule 1742/1 (Power=1)
Agreements between Players

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Orders binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary
      to effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1365/6 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Overturning Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 910/9 (Power=1)
The Justiciar

      There exists the Office of Justiciar, whose responsibility it is
      to serve on a Board of Appeals when necessary.

      The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts cannot Nominate for the
      Office of Justiciar.

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1833/0 (Power=1)
Lead Justice

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1570/0 (Power=1)
Announcement of Appeal

      The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the Public
      Forum as soon as possible after an Appeal has been initiated,
      including in eir announcement the matter of consideration of the
      Appeal and the identity of the Justices selected to serve on the
      Board of Appeals and which (if any) of these Players are
      ineligible to fill the positions to which they have been
      assigned.

      The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public Forum as
      soon as possible after any change in the identity of the
      Justices that takes place after the Board has been constituted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1564/9 (Power=1)
Initiating Appeals

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Motion, and the execution of any Judicial Order
      are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.  In
      addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
      has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
      required to perform.

      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1447/14 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Class 3 Infraction of Failing to Judge
      an Appeal, detected and reported by the Cotc, which results in
      that Justice's dismissal as a Justice from that Board. In this
      case the CotC must randomly select an eligible Player to replace
      em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      If a Justice submits eir determination to the Clerk of the
      Courts before the end of the assigned deliberation period,
      then the Clerk of the Courts shall pay out to that Justice
      the Judicial Salary as soon as possible after the publication
      of eir determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1694/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Dismissal

      If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
      consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1805/0 (Power=1)
Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1806/0 (Power=1)
No Appeal of Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
      accompanied by that false certification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1807/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Appellate Orders

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.

      All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1695/2 (Power=1)
Appeals of Judicial Orders

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Rule Violations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 908/11 (Power=1)
Formal Apologies

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1832/1 (Power=1)
Failure to Apologize

      The failure to abide by an Order to Submit a Formal Apology is

Rule 1503/4 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1815/0 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions without Penalties

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1504/6 (Power=1)

      the Rule(s) defining said Infraction, and sufficient details
      regarding the circumstances surrounding the offensing action
      (or inaction) to identify the offense.

      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies

Rule 1681/5 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

      doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category and
      assign the Rule to this new Category.

      The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees fit.

      If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must announce
      it in the Public Forum no later than the first subsequent
      publication of the Logical Ruleset.

Rule 1485/8 (Power=1)
Titles for Rules

      Each Rule has a Title, which is a single line of text
      containing not more than 60 characters.  The Title must be
      listed by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule.  However, the
      Title is not part of the Rule itself and has no effect on the
      meaning or application of the Rule, being merely a convenience
      for the Players.

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify a Title for
      the new Rule.  If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the
      new Rule's Title.

      change, the source of the Change (that is, a reference to the
      Proposal and its Proposer, or Rule or other entity which
      mandated the Change) , and the date upon which the change took
      effect.  Other Rules may require additional information to
      appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

      awarded a Unique Patent Title, then it shall automatically be
      revoked from any person already holding that Title.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1923/0 (Power=1)

======================================================================
Degrees and Theses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1367/5 (Power=1)
Degrees

      There shall exist a subset of the Patent Titles known as
      Degrees. A Patent Title is only a Degree if it is specifically
      made such by a Rule.  A person may use a Degree with eir name
      for any official or unofficial business if and only if e
      currently possesses that Degree.

      Persons may come to possess Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person possesses a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule specifying default
      properties of Patent Titles.

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A
      Player who has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1368/2 (Power=1)
The Legal Degrees

      The following Degrees are hereby made legal:

         - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
         - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
         - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N. Hist)
         - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
         - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil)

      Degrees shall be ranked in the order they appear in this Rule,
      with Degrees listed latest in the Rule being ranked higher than
      Degrees listed earlier. The abbreviations in parentheses are not
      part of the actual Degree.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1369/1 (Power=1)
Theses

      A Thesis (plura: Theses) shall be an essay whose topic is any
      facet of Agora Nomic, or Nomic in general. The topic should be
      substantially different from all other Theses previously
      approved, but this is not a requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1370/9 (Power=1)
How to Get a Degree

      A Degree is Granted by the operation of an instrument of
      sufficient Power specifying the Degree to be Granted, and its
      recipient.  The sufficient Power required to Grant a Degree is
      determined by the Degree to be Granted.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the Granting of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      Granted.

      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events
      which have occured in Agora within at least the last eight
      weeks, and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power
      of at least 2.

      The Degree of Master of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 2.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic Philosophy shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words, unless the intended recipient has also posted in the
      Public Forum an additional creative work authored by emself
      whose topic or theme is related to Agora or Nomic in general,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 3.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Currencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1467/6 (Power=1)
Definition of a Currency

     There may exist Currencies, which are classes of entities.
     Each Currency shall have a Minimum Unit Quantity, abbreviated
     MUQ, which shall be 1 unless otherwise specified.  All
     transfers and holdings of each Currency shall be rounded off to
     the nearest multiple of its MUQ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1578/5 (Power=1)
Currency Recordkeepors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Player (the
      Recordkeepor).  The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required
      to maintain a record of the number of units of that Currency
      possessed by each entity which possesses them, along with
      recent transfers of that Currency, as detailed elsewhere.

      If one of the Official duties of an Officer is to be the
      Recordkeepor for a Currency, then eir Report shall include
      the record above, and any changes thereto since the last
      posting of the Report.

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsiblity until
      a new Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever
      procedure applies.  If there is no procedure defined for
      selecting a new Recordkeepor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1579/5 (Power=1)
Mintors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

      All Players have Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1722/1 (Power=1)
Creation of New Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when the Mintor of that Currency posts
      in the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1911/0 (Power=1)
Basic Currencies

      A Currency is a Basic Currency only if defined as such by the
      Rules.

      Each Player has at most one Associated Basic Currency (ABC).
      Initially, Players have no ABC.  A Player who has no ABC may
      associate a Basic Currency with emself by declaring that e
      does so, and stating which Basic Currency is so associated,
      in the Public Forum.  A Player who has an ABC may change eir
      ABC by the same method, but only if:
      a) it has been at least 3 months since eir ABC was last set or
      changed, OR
      b) if the Currency which is to be eir new ABC became a Basic
      Currency more recently than eir ABC was last set or changed.

      A Player with an ABC may never cease to have any ABC at all,
      unless e ceases to be a Player, or eir ABC ceases to be a Basic
      Currency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1917/2 (Power=1)
General Currency Taxation

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may levy a tax on that Currency,
      subject to the following restrictions:

      a) All elements required to be specified in the announcement
         of the levy must also be specified in the annoucement of
         intent to issue the levy.
      b) The Effective Time of the levy must be between seven and
         fourteen days after the time of the annoucement of the
         intent to issue the levy.
      c) The Effective Time of a levy is at least one month after the
         last Effective Time of a levy on that Currency issued under
         the authority of this Rule.
      d) The annoucement of intent to issue the levy may not take
         place while another attempt to levy a tax on that Currency
         is pending under the authority of this Rule.
      e) If the Currency is a Bank Currency, then either the
         Recordkeepor is a member of the Cabinet at the time e
         levies the tax, or eir action has the support of two current
         Cabinet members.

      The tax may include exemptions on a fixed amount of the holdings
      of every taxable entity, provided that:

         (i) All Players are exempt identical amounts,
        (ii) All Non-players are exempt identical amounts,
       (iii) The Non-players' exemption is less than or equal to the
             Players' exemption.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Units of Currency

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1927/0 (Power=1)
Bank Currency Creation

      The Executor of a Bank Currency may Mint new units of that
      Currency, subject to the following restrictions:

      a) E announces eir intent between seven and fourteen days
         prior to the time of minting.
      b) Either e is a member of the Cabinet at the time e mints
         the currency, or eir action has the support of two Cabinet
         members.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1941/0 (Power=1)
Fees

      A Fee is a specific quantity of some particular Currency
      explicitly designated as such by the Rules. To Pay a Fee is
      to transfer the specified quantity of that particular Currency
      to the Bank if and only if that transfer is made solely for
      the purpose of Paying that particular instance of that Fee.

      If the Rules specify that a particular action is associated
      with a Fee, or that a Fee is required for a particular action,
      then the entity performing the action shall Pay the Fee either
      before performing said action (but not more than 72 hours
      beforehand) or in the same email as the action is performed,
      else the action shall not occur.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1598/8 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.  If a Transfer Order
      purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order and either that
      Payment Order does not exist or cannot be satisfied by the
      Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is invalid.  Other Rules
      may specify conditions which cause a Transfer Order to be deemed
      invalid.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1817/0 (Power=1)
Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1819/0 (Power=1)
Effect of Transfer Orders

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1820/0 (Power=1)
Recording of Transfer Orders

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1730/1 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1596/3 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1821/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1822/0 (Power=1)
Recording of Payment Orders

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1823/1 (Power=1)
Combining Payment Orders

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order or of a Transfer Order.

      Payment Orders executed for the purpose of billing the Payor for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1732/3 (Power=1)
Satisfaction of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that

      (i) when that Transfer Order was submitted, its submitter
      clearly indicated that that Transfer Order was being submitted
      for the purpose of satisfying the Payment Order in question;

      (ii) the Transfer Order has not satisfied any other Payment
      Order;

      (iii) the Payment Order has not already been satisfied or
      vacated;

      (iv) the Transfer Order would not have resulted in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of Currency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1599/4 (Power=1)
Failure to Execute Payment Orders

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1734/1 (Power=1)
Vacated Payment Orders

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate,
      respectively, the reversing Order required by this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1913/1 (Power=1)
Definition of Expected Currencies

      An Outstanding Payment Order is one that has neither been
      satisfied nor vacated.

      For each entity able to own Currency, there is a value for
      each Currency, at any given time, known as the Expected value
      of that Currency.  This value is equal to the number of units
      of that Currency owned by that entity, plus the number of units
      of that Currency named in Outstanding POs with that Entity as
      Payee, minus the number of units of that Currency named in
      Outstanding Payment Orders with that Entity as Payor.  A Player
      for whom the Expected value of P-Notes is 5, for example, is
      said to have 5 Expected P-Notes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1713/9 (Power=1)
Debt

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied, unless the Payment Order was issued while
      the Payor was On Hold, in which case the Payment Order becomes
      overdue if it has been effective and unsatisfied for more than
      seven days after the Payor first comes Off Hold.

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.  If an entity has more
      than one Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor
      commits as many such Infractions as there are different
      Currencies named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  Persistent Indebtedness is a Class 1 Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1853/5 (Power=1)
Levying Taxes

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage (but
            not to exceed fifty percent unless permitted by the Rule
            specifically authorizing the levy);
        (3) any exemptions from the levy (but only as permitted
            by the Rules authorizing specific levies);
        (4) the Effective Time of the levy, which may not be earlier
            than the time of the announcement, nor more than four
            weeks later than the time of the announcment; and
        (5) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the Effective Time of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's Expected holdings of
          the Currency being taxed, at the Effective Time of the levy,
          less any amount which the legal authorization of that
          specific tax levy allows to be excluded from taxation.

      (f) The Bank and any Rebellious Players are not taxable
          entities.  All other entities are.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1661/6 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      Stems from the Bank to specific Players, only as specified in
      this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      one or more Payment Orders from the Bank to Players for a total
      of not more than 30 Stems.  The Players to receive the award
      must not have received a Patronage award within the preceding
      four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a reason along with
      the Payment Order.  All such Patronage Awards in a single Week
      must be posted in a single message.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the

Rule 1887/5 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Auctions

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is responsible for collecting
          bids and announcing the result of the Auction.  Unless
          otherwise specified, the Speaker shall be the Auctioneer.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
          On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
          Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. If the Rules do not specify a Currency
          to be used, then the Auction does not proceed.

      (d) Number of Items: Each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical items.  Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of items up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum,
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction
          Currency, the number of items, and the value of the Starting
          Bid.

      (f) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting Bid
          is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (g) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
          Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
          particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
          valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

        (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction,
            or after its end.
        (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
            Auction Currency.
        (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (h) Cancelling Bids: A Bid may be cancelled by its Bidder by
          posting such to the Public Forum, clearly identifying the
          Bid to be cancelled, while the Auction is in progress.

      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have passed
          without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid (at the
          time the Bid is made) having been made.  The Auction shall
          end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has not
          ended earlier.

      (j) Winning Bids: When the Auction ends, the winning Bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid Bids in that auction (or all
          valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled Bids.  Ties shall be broken in favor of
          earlier-submitted bids.  The Auctioneer shall announce the
          winning Bids and their Bidders as soon as possible after the
          end of the Auction.  For each winning Bid, the Auctioneer
          shall bill the associated Bidder:

        (1) The amount of the Nth highest winning Bid, if there were N
            or more valid uncancelled winning Bids in the auction;
        (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
            uncancelled winning Bids.

          Note that it is possible for a single Player to have more
          than one Winning Bid.  If this happens, the Auctioneer shall
          issue separate POs for each Winning Bid and shall not
          combine them into a single PO, and this Rule takes
          precedence over Rules which would permit such a combination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1888/0 (Power=1)
Private Auctions

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Probate
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1601/7 (Power=1)
Probate

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding. This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would destroy an entity while it
      possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Debt: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payor.

      2. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      3. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      4. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      5. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      6. Assets: the Currency holdings and credits of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

      8. Terminal: an entity in Probate is terminal unless another
         Rule states otherwise.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1637/3 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1908/1 (Power=1)
Automatic Dispensation

      If an entity is placed in Probate, the Notary shall become its
      Executor and shall perform the following actions as soon as
      possible in the following order:

        i) The Notary shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
        its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
        amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
        not. All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
        cancelled.

      If the entity in Probate is not terminal, the Notary shall stop
      here.

        ii) The Notary shall apply the Will, if any, of the entity in
        Probate to the extent possible. Any assets remaining after the
        application of the Will shall be divided amongst the heirs
        named in the Will, assigning to each heir a portion computed
        in a manner consistent with the Will; if the Will is silent or
        unclear on the division of remaining assets, the division
        shall be equal.

        iii) The Notary shall assign any remaining Indulgences to the
        Bank, and expunge an equal number of the entity in Probate's
        Blots.  If the entity does not have that many Blots, then the
        Notary shall expunge all of the entity's Blots.

        iv) If the entity in Probate has Blots remaining, then the
        Notary shall assign all Indulgence credits to the Bank, and
        expunge a number of the entity's Blots equal to the total
        amount of the credits thus assigned.  If the entity does not
        have that many Blots, then the Notary shall expunge all of the
        entity's Blots.

        v) The Notary shall cancel any remaining credits, and assign
        any remaining units of a Currency to the Mintor of that
        Currency.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by issuing a
      Transfer Order for those units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by issuing a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned, for the same amount of Currency as specified by the
      credit. However, if these are the same entity, then the credit
      is assigned by doing nothing.

      A debt is cancelled by vacating the Payment Order which
      established it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1757/2 (Power=1)
Implementation of Probate Plans

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

======================================================================
The Bank
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1470/3 (Power=1)
The Bank

      There shall exist a set of Entities known collectively as the
      Bank. This set consists of one Entity for each Bank Currency
      defined by the rules, which is the Mintor of that Currency.
      Each of the Entities in the Bank has Mint Authority.

      A Transfer Order (or Payment Order) of Bank Currency to (or
      from) the Bank shall be interpreted unambiguously to be a
      Transfer (Payment) Order to (from) the Mintor of that
      Currency. Transfer Orders or Payment orders to or from the
      Bank in non-Bank Currencies are invalid.

      Each of these Entities may only own Currency of its associated
      type. A Transfer order or Payment Order involving the Mintor
      of a Bank Currency, which is not in that Currency is invalid.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1735/5 (Power=1)
Recordkeepors As Bank's Executors

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Bank Currency is the Executor of the
          Mintor of that Currency. E may be referred to as that
          Currency's Executor.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Mintor of a Bank Currency is the payor, the
          Executor of that Currency shall either satisfy the Payment
          Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, e
          need not do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ
          first.

      (c) If the Executor of a Bank Currency executes a Transfer Order
          from the Bank for any reason other than to satisfy a Payment
          Order (except when specifically required by the Rules to
          submit a Transfer Order), e commits the Class 15 Crime of
          Misappropriation, and upon conviction of this Crime shall
          be removed from Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1479/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill"

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some quantity of
      Currency to some entity, that Player shall execute a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that entity for the amount specified.

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill an entity for some
      quantity of Currency, that Player shall execute a Payment Order
      from that entity to the Bank for the amount specified.

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be
      defined by other Rules. A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
      defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,

      Player, as well as any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1929/1 (Power=1)
Points

      Points are a measure of a Player's unloserliness. The number of
      Points a Player has is called eir Score. The Score of each
      Player is at all times an integer. A new Player, or a Player
      with no Score starts with a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is invalid:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first such notification for that specific
            event

      Having a Score of 200 Points or more is a Win Condition. If at
      any time a Player Wins the Game, all Player's Scores shall
      instantly be set to zero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1930/0 (Power=1)

      5 Points.

      If a Player is Impeached, e may be Penalized 15 Points.

      If a Revolt succeeds, each Rebellious Player may be Awarded
      15 Points.

      If a Revolt fails, each Rebellious Player may be Penalized
      10 Points.

      If a Player submits a Proposal which is Adopted, e may be
      Awarded a number of Points equal to twice the number of
      AGAINST Votes cast on that Proposal.

      If a Player submits an Insane Proposal which is Adopted,
      e may be Awarded 5 Points, in addition to any other Awards
      for that particular Proposal.

      If a Player is the only Player to Vote either FOR or AGAINST
      a particular Proposal that e did not write or Propose, e may
      be Awarded 10 Points.

      If a Judgement is Sustained on Appeal, the original Judge

      may be Penalized 5 Points.

      If a Player gains a Patent Title, e may be Awarded 5 Points.

      If a Player is granted a Degree, e may be Awarded 10 Points.

======================================================================
Indulgences and Blots
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1435/11 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Bank Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is .1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.

      A Blot is a stain on a Player's record, recorded by the Herald.

      Whenever the Rules state that a Player gains or is assessed some
      number of Blots, and specify a method of reporting that gain or
      assessment to the Herald, the Herald shall record this increase
      in the number of Blots staining the affected Player as soon as
      possible after receiving the notification.

      Blots may be expunged from a Player's record as follows:

      i.  The Rules authorize the expunging of Blots and specify
          a method by which this is reported to the Herald.

      ii. The Executor of an entity may expunge a number of Blots
          by posting publicly the number of Blots to be expunged and
          the Player to whom the Blots belong and Paying a Fee of a
          number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots to be
          expunged. Any attempt to expunge more of a Player's Blots
          than e has fails.

     iii. The Player originally reporting the imposition of a Blot
          penalty may expunge the reported Blots, if e determines
          that the penalty was imposed in error.

     iv.  Blots may be expunged by Judicial or Appellate Orders.

      The Herald shall record the decrease in the number of Blots
      staining a Player as soon as possible after receiving
      notification of the expungement or after successfully
      executing the relevant Indulgence Transfer Order.

      The Rules may define other methods by which the Herald may be
      required to record changes to a Player's Blot status.

      A player with zero Blots staining eir record is said to be
      Immaculate.  Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing condition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1712/6 (Power=1)
Distribution of Indulgences

      As soon as possible after the start of each month, the Priest
      shall Auction a number of Indulgences equal to the number of
      Players, plus the sum of the Blots of all Players, minus the sum
      of the Expected Indulgences of all entities except the Bank,
      minus the number of Outstanding Indulgence Auction Payment
      Orders, and with fractions rounded up to the next integer.
      (Note that the third term, the sum of the Expected Indulgences
      of all entities except the Bank, may well be negative.)  The
      Expected Indulgences of entities shall be determined from the
      most recently published Herald's report; other values in this
      formula shall be determined as of the time of the start of the
      Auction.  However, if the Priest makes an error in determining
      the number of Indulgences to be Auctioned, in good faith, that
      number shall be allowed to stand.  If the number of Indulgences
      so caclulated is non-positive, the Priest shall not conduct such
      an auction in that month.

      The items to be auctioned are individual Indulgences, and thus
      the number of items is equal to the number of Indulgences to
      be Auctioned.  The Auctioneer shall be the Priest, and the
      Auction shall be conducted in Indulgence Auction Tokens (IATs).

      Upon completion of the Auction, the POs associated with the
      Winning Bids shall be known as Indulgence Auction Payment
      Orders (IAPOs).  The Priest shall note which IAT POs are
      IAPOs.

      When an IAPO is satisfied, the Priest shall pay out one
      Indulgence to the Payor of that IAPO.

      If an IAPO remains unsatisfied three weeks after it is issued,
      the Priest shall vacate the IAPO.

Rule 1714/6 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than 20 Blots staining
      eir record.

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

      To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
      Lawless is the Class 15 Crime of Persecution.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1747/2 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the Blots
           staining the Pardoned Player's record as required to reduce
           the number of Blots to one less than the threshold for
           Lawlessness and notify the Herald of this action.

        2) After the above step has been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        3) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        4) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties as a result of Indulgences for three months after
           being Pardoned, but during this period e may only use
           Indulgences to expunge Blots from eir record and may not
           transfer any Indulgences to another Entity.


      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      when a deregistered Player may reregister, or Persistent
      Indebtedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1439/8 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four, unless the violated Rule explicitly defines
      or forbids a Blot penalty in the case of a CFJ.  The penalty
      shall be as defined in the Rule, if the Rule defines it; no Blot
      penalty shall be imposed if the Rule forbids it.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall notify the
      Herald of the Blot assessment.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall expunge the Blots that were given due
      to the initial Judgement of the CFJ and notify the Herald of
      this action.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1437/5 (Power=1)
Fugitives from Justice

      When a Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  The Herald
      shall continue to keep a record of the number Blots staining
      each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Blots staining each Fugitive of Justice, rounding
      down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have eir number of
      Blots reduced to less than one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, e ceases to be a
      Fugitive from Justice.  The act of reregistration causes
      no change in eir number of Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1924/0 (Power=1)
Immaculate Rewards and Zombie Upkeep

      Now the truth is that we see,
      How much better we'd all be,
      If immaculatity,
      Were rewarded, I and thee,
      Were we to acknowledge those,
      With the pur'ty of a rose,
      At the end of quarter each,
      Since the virtues we do teach,
      Herald with eir records true,
      Shall pay out but one, not two,
      'ndulgences to each of y'all,
      'mmaculate past quarter all,
      By what name this gift shall be,
      Called for all eternity,
      Like some old tradition knew,
      As my latest gift to you,

      Nonetheless there still are those,
      Everybody surely knows,
      We can find them anywhere,
      (But it's very rude to stare),
      Those with Zombies at their side,
      Mindless hordes they try to hide,
      Surely there should be some price,
      (It's unnatur'l to live twice),
      Since we want to boost morale,
      Once again the herald shall,
      Only for those three months past,
      Have been held b'eir master last,
      Bill the players who did own,
      Zombies (which will often moan),
      Only one and never two,
      Fair Indulgences (mon dieu!),
      Every zombie undead for,
      Perhaps one, but maybe more.

Rule 1916/2 (Power=1)
Indulgence Auction Tokens

      Indulgence Auction Tokens (IATs) are a Bank Currency.  The

Changing Speakers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1647/7 (Power=1)
The Speaker-Elect

      There exists the Office of Speaker-Elect, whose responsibility
      it is to be the Speaker's successor.

      Whenever the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be
      Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker can never hold the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      The Clerk of the Courts and Justiciar cannot Nominate for the
      Office of Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect has no Electee, because of the
      Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker (or for any other reason), the
      Office is filled according to the Order of Succession, as
      defined by other Rules.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1648/3 (Power=1)
When the Speaker Is Tainted

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1658/3 (Power=1)
Tainting the Speaker

      A Speaker shall become Tainted when a Referendum calling for the
      Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is authorized
      to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the
      Public Forum.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows:

      * The Vote Collector is the Registrar
      * Voters do not include the Speaker.
      * The Adoption Index is 2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 681/10 (Power=1)
Giving Up Speakership

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, e commits the Class 0.2
      Infraction of Resigning the Speakership, and a Speaker
      Transition occurs.  This Infraction is to be reported by the
      new Speaker once the Transition is complete.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1375/7 (Power=1)
Speaker Going On Hold

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 786/9 (Power=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to
      be:

      the Promotor
      the Assessor
      the Justiciar
      the Clerk of the Courts
      the Rulekeepor
      the Registrar
      all Officers in order of most recent registration
      all Active Players in order of most recent registration

      except that the Speaker does not appear in the Order.  The Order
      of Succession is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      If there is ever no electee for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the
      Office shall be held by the Active Player highest in the order
      of succession who has not declined since there was last an
      electee to the Office of Speaker-Elect. A Player declines by
      sending a message to the Public Forum stating e does so. If
      there is only one Active Player in the order of succession who
      has not declined, that Player may not decline.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 402/7 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Payroll Clerk shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1581/3 (Power=1)
Quarterly Speaker Change

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.

======================================================================
Subordinate Legal Codes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under
      the Rules.  A body of law is a SLC only if it is granted that
      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the
      Rules for being a SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1595/0 (Power=1)
Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence
      for the components, if any, within a given SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1594/1 (Power=1)
Violation of SLCs

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of one Blot, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1457/11 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1590/2 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      SLC between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1592/0 (Power=1)
Authority of SLCs to Change Properties

      A SLC has the power to define the manner in which certain
      properties of entities are changed.  This power shall be limited
      to any property solely defined by that SLC and to any other
      property to which the Rules grant that SLC this authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Organizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1528/6 (Power=1)
Organizations

      There are entities known as Organizations.  An entity is only an
      Organization when specifically designated as such by the Rules.
      Each Organizations consists of the following elements:

        i) An associated SLC.
       ii) A set of Players under the Jurisdiction of the associated
           SLC.
      iii) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

      No Organization exists that is not of a class of Organization
      that is defined in the Rules. The class of an Organization is
      specified when it is formed, and can not change thereafter.  If
      a class of Organization ever becomes undefined in the Rules,
      then all Organizations of that class are immediately dissolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1614/6 (Power=1)
Organizations' Names

      Each Organization shall have a unique name. No action is
      permitted that would allow either a nameless Organization to
      exist.

      The Name of an Organization shall only be changed as specified
      by its SLC, or as specified in the Rules. If no other procedure
      is specified, the Name of any Organization shall change with the
      unanimous consent of all Players within the Jurisdiction of that
      Organization's SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1612/1 (Power=1)
Organizations' SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified in an Organization's SLC, that SLC
      can be changed by the unanimous consent of all the Players
      within the SLCs Jurisdiction.

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC is permitted to vary
      over the period of its existence. The SLC of an Organization
      ceases to exist when the Organization ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1531/8 (Power=1)
Administrators and Their Duties

      The Administrator of an Organization shall be within the
      Jurisdiction of that Organization's SLC, be the Maintainer
      of the Organization's SLC, and be the Executor of that
      Organization.

      The Administrator shall inform the Notary of the following
      changes as soon as possible after they occur, and identify the
      nature of the change:

        i) The Name of the Organization changes.
       ii) The Administrator of the Organization changes.
      iii) The Executor of the Organization changes.
       iv) The Maintainer of the Organization's SLC changes.
        v) The Jurisdiction of the Organization's SLC changes.
       vi) The Organization undergoes a Voluntary Dissolution.

      The Administrator also shall be the Player required to maintain
      a record of the Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Organization's SLC.

      Rules governing specific classes of Organizations may specify
      different duties for the Administrator.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1759/1 (Power=1)
Organizational Payment Orders

      The Executor of an Organization's SLC is empowered to execute
      Payment Orders from the Organization or from any Player within
      its Jurisdiction, but only such Payment Orders as are authorized
      by the SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1533/10 (Power=1)
Application to Create an Organization

      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create
      an Organization (ACO).  A valid ACO, in order to have effect
      upon Execution, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      A valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      sending it to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be Executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1397/6 (Power=1)
Dissolution of Organizations

      An Organization shall be dissolved only when the Rules or the
      Organization's SLC requires it.  An Organization shall be
      required to be dissolved whenever any of the following
      conditions is true:

        (i)  the Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is
             no provision for this to change;

       (ii)  the continued existence of the Organization would require
             that the Organization not have all of a legal
             Administrator, a legal Executor, and a legal Maintainer
             for its SLC; or

      (iii)  the SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
             dissolve.

      Requirement to dissolve by condition (iii) is Voluntary.  Any
      other requirement to dissolve is Administrative.

      The Notary shall detect when an Administrative Dissolution takes
      place.

      Each Organization ceases to exist upon its dissolution.  Other
      Rules may require an Organization to dissolve under other
      circumstances.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1617/1 (Power=1)
Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC shall only be changed
      in accordance with that SLC and with the Rules.  If there are no
      provisions for changing such an SLC, then the SLC can not be
      changed.

      No Player shall ever be made part of the Jurisdiction of the SLC
      of any Organization without eir consent.  This takes precedence
      over any Rule that would permit a Player to be involuntarily
      made part of the Jurisdiction of such a SLC.

Rule 766/12 (Power=1)
Groups

      A Group is an Organization with an associated SLC called its
      Ordinances.  The Administrator for each Group is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor, the Executor is its Vizier, and the set of
      Players within the Jurisdiction of its SLC is its Membership.

      A Group's Membership may contain any Player who is not a
      Member of any other Group.  Initially, the Group's Membership
      must contain at least three Foundors.  The Ordinancekeepor
      and the Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of
      the Group; if either ceases to be a Member of the Group, it
      dissolves.

      Each Group has Mint Authority and a Legislative Status.

Honour
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1062/1 (Power=1)
Kudos and Honour

      Let there be an Entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos). The
      amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eir Honour. All Players
      possess at all times an integral number of Kudos not less than
      0.

      A new Player, or a Player with no Kudo record starts with 20
      Kudos. If a Player is deregistered but returns within three
      months, e starts with the same number of Kudos e had when e
      left. If e returns after a longer time than three months, e is
      treated as a new Player with respect to Kudos.
