The following message from Steve to this list was originally bounced
because it was not recognized as coming from a list-member (the email
address from which it came was given as gardner@silas-2.cc.monash.edu.au ,
while Steve's subscription was under the address gardner@cc.monash.edu.au

The message you refer to was trapped by the listserver as a result of
the spam blockage, but I forwarded it on Sunday and it appeared then.
Oerjan and I have been discussing it, so evidently its reached him. I
don't know why you haven't received it; I'll check your subscription.
But the lists are not trapping other messages; I'd see them if they
were. (Actually, it did trap one other message of yours this morning,
which I've also sent on.)

I think volume is just down.
