<h1>Tue</h1>
In the beginning, there was Yoyo, and it was good.  But lo, after many
months there came to be a surfeit of traffic on Yoyo, and other
difficulties.  Thus were created the primary lists nomic-official and
nomic-discussion, and later their brother nomic-business.  Yoyo was left
to languish, a poor backup server millions of cubits from its more
active cousins.  Then suddenly, in the summer of the fourth year, there
came to pass a great crisis, for the teleport lists were smote down for
the neglect of their owner Coren.  And the Players flocked back to Yoyo
in great numbers, once again trafficking mightily through the
transpacific fiber.  From the darkness, there arose a cry: "But now
there is no backup server, to catch us should the benevolent Yoyo fall!"
And then was heard a single voice: "I shall provide."  Player Andre
spake unto his Service Provider, de Technische Universiteit Eindhoven;
and thus was created Tue.  Tue was to serve as backup even unto the
venerable Yoyo.  Yea, the very Public Forum extendeth its arm to enclose
the new-fledged Tue.
