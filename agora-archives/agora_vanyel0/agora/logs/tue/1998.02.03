I haven't been getting any mail from the gecko server for some time
now, although I do get mail from elsewhere. I have seen most posts to
a-b and a-o on Vanyels still running web archive, and I hope I haven't
missed anything meant for me personally.

Does anyone know whether there is bad wheather or something that
delays mail from gecko on its way round the world?

I had some problems the weekend before this last one, but since then I've seen
all gecko mail (as far as I know) within a reasonable amount of time.

I note that you are subscribed to the gecko lists as

klaush@scarlet.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de

and to the backup lists as

klaush@tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de.

If your messages to the backup lists came back, I suggest you change your
gecko subscriptions to the latter.  ("majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au" ->
body of "subscribe agora-discussion klaush@tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de" etc.)

Mail to scarlet.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de passes directly to that machine,
which I cannot get contact to on the mail port (although it is alive and
answering the ordinary telnet port...)

Mail to tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de passes to the alternatives of
dij91.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de, which I also cannot contact on the mail
port, or to mi.ruhr-uni-bochum.de, which seems to be working fine.

klaush@dij91.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de is incidently the address on your
outgoing mail, which means replying directly to you probably won't work
either.  I am sending this message to the most likely working address.

You might talk to your sysadmin about either making your outgoing mail
address hostname free or, if that is not possible, to have em set up
wildcard Mail eXchange records.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

The US Internet backbone was having problems today.  This often causes
clogging on European and Asian servers, and makes the whole global net
slow.
