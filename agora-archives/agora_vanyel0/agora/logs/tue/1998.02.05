I still haven't completely figured out what the problem with our local
mail configuration is, but Oerjans careful "research" helped a lot. 

At the moment I think I don't receive mail addressed to me at the
scarlet.tp3.etc address (under which I am subscribed to the gecko
lists).

So I would like to ask Steve to manually change my subscription to the
gecko lists to the address

klaush@tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de

I sent requests to derigister with the old address and reregister with
the new one to Majordomo@gecko, but haven't had any feedback yet.

This may be due to the second problem: possibly I'm not receiving mail
sent to the address that appears in my From: and ReplyTo: Headers. So
if you want to send mail to me personally, please make sure it has the
@tp3 address.

Sorry for the mess - I understand it's part of our university's
antispam endeavours.

Hi all,

Just after sending out this message I received a huge batch of Agora
mail from the last few days. So it seems that Steve already
reregistered me (thanks) and I am now getting mails as normal again. 

Special thanks again to Oerjan for the detailed tests and info he gave
me.
