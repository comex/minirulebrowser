<h1>Agora-official</h1>
In August of 1994, it was decided that to not be swamped with Nomic
mail, it would be nice to receive only the official documents.  Thus,
nomic-official was created for the transmission of Officer's Reports and
Proposal distributions and results; later this task passed to its
successor, agora-official.  All Players are required to be subscribed to
agora-official.
