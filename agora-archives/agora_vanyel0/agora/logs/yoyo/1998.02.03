I haven't been getting any mail from the gecko server for some time
now, although I do get mail from elsewhere. I have seen most posts to
a-b and a-o on Vanyels still running web archive, and I hope I haven't
missed anything meant for me personally.

Does anyone know whether there is bad wheather or something that
delays mail from gecko on its way round the world?

The US Internet backbone was having problems today.  This often causes
clogging on European and Asian servers, and makes the whole global net
slow.

That's odd.  I telnet into dfw.net from various wisc.edu
computers.  (Separated by about 1000 miles physically.)  I was
getting really slow connections all of Sunday and Monday, but
haven't had any trouble today.
