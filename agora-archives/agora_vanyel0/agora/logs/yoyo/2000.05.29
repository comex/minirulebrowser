This message is intended to be a message sent to a Public Forum.

I am currently having difficulties sending mail from my computer
because of "upgrades" of the mail system.  I'm hoping this message
gets sent.

Anyway, I hope to be able to finish sending out CFJs, new and Judged,
as soon as the "upgrades" stop happening.
