Hi all,

Sorry for this test mail. But I've hardly seen any Agora related mails
in the last few days (sniff), although I checked Majordomo@gecko to
make sure I'm still subscribed to all three lists.

It seems to me others had similar problems recently - anyone know
what's going on?

Thanks, Kolja A.

It's been quiet; true.  I was away all last week, and I will be pretty
quiet this week too as I catch up on everything that was abandoned
during that time.   

But maybe there are mail problems as well. 

For the moment, relax and enjoy the calm is my only advice :-)

Michael.
