On your view, then, the existence of a deference clause removes the
possibility of a conflict. But then how do you make sense of R1030? That
Rule states that:

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of itself
      that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

In other words, the Rules assume that deference clauses step in to
resolve conflicts that already exist, not that they prevent conflict
from arising in the first place. 

Also note the mirror image treatment of precedence and deference claims
in R1030, supporting my claim that the Mirror Image Assumption is true.

It follows from my view that there is a difference between a Rule, Q,
which says "X, unless Rule R says not-X." and one which says "X. This
Rule defers to Rule R." In the first case, Q and R do not conflict,
whereas in the second case, they do. I agree that Rules can be written
so as to avoid conflict. Higher Powered Rules can even be written so as
to avoid conflict with lower Powered Rules. But, perhaps regrettably, it
turns out that this cannot be achieved by using deference clauses,
because deference clauses assume the existence of a conflict (see
R1030), and R1482 has its own ideas about how conflicts between Rules
with unequal Power are resolved.

The trouble is that the Rules assume that if a deference clause is being
invoked, then a disagreement already exists.

Anyway, a Judge will now get to decide whether the Mirror Image
Assumption is true.

It appears that the DNS name change has begun earlier than expected.
There may be some difficulties while the name change propagates. My
local name server appears to have picked up the change now.
