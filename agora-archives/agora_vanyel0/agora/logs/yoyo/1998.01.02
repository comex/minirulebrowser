I am new to the world of nomics and desire to join YoYo (particularly as
it is Australian origin). I will be reading the ruleset soonest but
wanted to get the ball rolling in the meantime. If I have not submitted
my request to join correctly (by the rules) then I request that I be
E-Mailed an advice of such.

In anticipation

Bye for Now

Kieron Jarvis

I don't know if the foregoing is sufficient solely for the reason that
I don't remember whether the yoyo list is still a Public Forum.
Steve?

In any case, welcome, Kieron!
