         8/21-9/8  Assigned to Harlequin, who defaults
         9/8-11    Reassigned to Proglet, who Judges TRUE
         "The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the
          Rule defers to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with
          the other Rule arising, but shows only how the Rule says that
          conflict is to be resolved when it does arise."

CFJ 1105 [Lee] Judgement:  TRUE
         9/8  Assigned to Morendil, who Judges TRUE
         "The method Michael used is not sufficiently random and
          therefore incorrect according to the rules."

CFJ 1106 [Lee] Judgement:  FALSE
         9/8-9  Assigned to Blob, who Judges FALSE
         "In calculating the success of the Revolt of 3 Sep 1998, Swann

          determining the total number of players."

CFJ 1107 [Kolja A.] Judgement:  FALSE
         9/16-22  Assigned to Blob, who Judges FALSE

          Order under the condition that this transfer 'would result in
          an entity possessing a negative quantity of Currency'

I transfer 1, 2, and 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy these Transfer Orders.

btw, I haven't been seeing my own messages to the list for something
like a week now.  Did someone change the list configuration?

Subject: Assorted Speaker business


I hereby award a Speaker's Patronage of 1 Indulgence to Morendil, for eir
assistance in the Rebellion.

Swann and I also agreed to grant Morendil the following:

  * Backing in the next Speaker-Elect Election.  Well, that's taken care of.
  * One Proposal Vote (each) cast as you direct.
  * One declaration (Without Objection) that a Proposal has achieved Quorum,
      by whichever of us became Speaker first.

Care to name your targets?


As for this Failure to Report business, let's make it interesting:  I agree
not to report any cases of Failure to Report during the month of September
1998, provided that a total of at least 5 Indulgences are transferred to me
during that month for the sole purpose of preventing me from so reporting.

I haven't put him Probate yet.  I guess I should do that now:  I hereby
announce that Swann is in Probate.  I assign myself as Trustee, unless
someone else would like to do it, in which case I'll resign as Trustee
and assign them instead.

Unofficially, it looks like Swann's Probate status is as follows.  Things
should be pretty straightforward.

Assets:   5.8 VTs, 2 P-Notes, 2 Indulgences
Credits:  VT2680, VT2709, VT2748, VT2768, RVTP0619, RVTP0644
            all for 0.2 VTs from Bank
Debts:    VT2556     4.6 VTs to Bank
Will:     none
