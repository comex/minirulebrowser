Dear proglet,

welcome on board!

You have sent your registration message to yoyo - please note that the
PF also includes other mailing lists, and that you don't have to, but
may want to, follow the agora-discussion list.

I Hope we'll soon hear more from you, about your interest in Agora
etc.

Kolja A.
