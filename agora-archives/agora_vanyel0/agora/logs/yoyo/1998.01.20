And welcome to you, Sherlock! Goodness, that's three Players in less than
two weeks, and I've still got 100 messages to read...

I notice you sent that to nomic@yoyo. You may be unaware that most
of the game is now conducted via the three lists at <agora-official@
gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>, <agora-business@gecko...> and and <agora-
discussion@gecko...>. Subscription the yoyo list is still required,
though, as is subscription to the second backup list at <agora@win.tue.nl>.

   Steve,
    Sorry to bother you again... I have one last question/request.
How do I get added to the .nl backup list?  I think I'm all fine with
the other four...
