<h1>Agora-business</h1>
In December of 1994, it was noted that a lot of important stuff was
still being sent to nomic-discussion instead of nomic-official, because
they weren't technically official documents (such as Officer reports).
This meant that an Agoran really had to be subscribed to both, nulling
the advantage of the separation in the first place.  Rather than send
this non-official stuff to nomic-official, a new list was created,
called nomic-business, for important stuff that wasn't really official.
All players are required to be subscribed to nomic-business.

As of the Big Move, the business list is now known as "agora-business".
