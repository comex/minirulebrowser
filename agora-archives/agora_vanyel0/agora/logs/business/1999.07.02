There's a bit of internal contradiction in this Proto (10 Denaria to the
first Player to find it and point it out), but that should be okay, since
I'm not proposing it yet.

(There is no salami in this proto.)

----------
This Protoproposal shall have AI=2.
In this Protoproposal, each line beginning with a hash (#) shall be 
considered a comment, and shall have no effect.

# This Protoproposal is still incomplete, but the basic idea should be
# clear.

Protoproposal h014.2 (Entities) 

Amend Rule 1586 by replacing the first paragraph with text reading:

	'entity' and 'Entity' are not synonymous.

	'Entity' and 'Nomic Entity' are synonymous.

	Each entity that has no discernible existence without the Rules,
	only existing by virtue of the Rule or Rules definining it to
	exist, is an Entity.  

Create a Rule, titled "Labels", reading:

	Each Entity may have a Label.  An Entity with a defined Label is
	Labeled.  An Entity with no defined Label is Unlabeled.  No two
	Entities may have the same Label.
	
	A Label consists of one or more characters.

Create a Rule, titled "Subclasses of Entities", reading:

	Rules may define subclasses of Entities.  Each such subclasses is
	an Entity, and must be Labeled.

	Each Entity may be a member of any natural number of subclasses of
	Entities, so long as that many subclasses are defined by the Rules.  
	For the purposes of this Rule, natural numbers include zero and
	each number which is one greater than some other natural number.

	A member of a subclass of Entities may be referred to by a string
	consisting of the Label of the subclass followed by the word
	'Entity'.  For example, if there were a subclass with the Label
	'X', then a member of X could be referred to by 'X Entity'.

	A member of a subclass of Entities may be referred to by the Label
	of the subclass.

Amend Rule 1688 by striking the second paragraph.

Create a Rule, titled "Instruments", reading:

	There exists a subclass of Entities with the Label 'Instrument'.

	Each Instrument has Power greater than zero.  If not otherwise
	defined, the Power of an Instrument is 1.

Create a Rule, titled "Actors", reading:

	There exists a subclass of Entities with the Label "Actor".

	Each Actor is an Instrument with Power equal to 1.

Amend Rule 869 by inserting the following paragraphs directly before the
first paragraph:

	There exists a subclass of Entities with the Label "Player".

	Each Player is an Actor and may have a nickname.

Create a Rule, titled "Definition of Privileged Action", reading:
	
	A Privileged Action may be associated with each subclass of Entities.
	No subclass of Entities has an associated Privileged Action 
	The Rules may define a Privileged Action for any subclass of 
	Entities.  No two subclasses of Entities may have the same 
	Privileged Action.

	For each subclass X of Entities and Privileged Action Y 
	corresponding to X: Only X Entities may perform Y.  X Entities
	are generally authorized to perform Y.  However, other Rules may
	withdraw this authorization in specific circumstances from an
	X Entity without that Entity ceasing to be X.

Change the title of Rule 206 to "Voting Entities and Proposing Entities".
Repeal Rule 1605.

Amend Rule 206 to read:

	The Privileged Action for Voting Entities is voting on Proposals.
	The Privileged Action for Proposing Entities is making Proposals.

	Each Voting Entity has two votes on each Proposal, unless another
	Rule indicates otherwise.  However, no such Entity shall have
	more than five votes on any Proposal, other Rules notwithstanding.

	Any Entity which is Voting or Proposing must have an Executor in 
	order to perform its Privileged Action, other Rules notwithstanding.

Replace the first two paragraphs of Rule 1889 with text reading:

	Each Player is either a Legislator or a Voter, but not both.  

	Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that person
	has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time within the
	12 months prior to this registration, e is a Voter.

	A Legislator is a Proposing Entity.  A Voter is a Voting Entity.

> I hereby announce the start of an election for Treasuror and call for

I nominate for Treasuror, with the following proto-budget.

 Accountor               1.5
 Assessor                1.0
 [Chancellor*]            1.0
 Clerk of the Courts     1.0
 Herald                  1.5
 Justiciar               0.0
 Notary                  1.0

 Registrar               1.0
 Rulekeepor              1.5
 Scorekeepor             1.0
 Speaker-Elect           0.0

 Unemployment Benefits   0.5

 Treasuror's Payment     1.0

 Speaker's Gratuity      1.0


I am, of course, willing to listen to arguments to raise or lower an
office's salary.


* I can find no rule that specifies any salary for the Chancellor. I
searched for "salary", "Chancellor", "Treasuror" and "budget", but found no
such rule. Am I just missing it?
