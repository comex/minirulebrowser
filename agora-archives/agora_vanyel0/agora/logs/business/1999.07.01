Thanks.  I have corrected my records and this will show up on the
next report.  Sorry for the mistake.  BTW, since this transfer
occurred before Charged VTs, this particular VT is still neutral.

Several problems with this message.

1.  I don't think there is any proposal up for a vote.
2.  You have no neutral VTs to transfer.
3.  I don't consider casting a vote to indirectly specify
    any destination for currency transfer, since that act
    does not establish any requirement for currency to be
    transferred.  That must wait for the Assessor to issue
    a PO.  Therefore, IMO, this does not even meet the
    requirements to be a valid TO.

I recently started working on a series of 'Minor Changes' Proposals, all to be
Disinterested, and all to (appropriately enough) make minor changes to Rules,
such as "Spelling and Quantification" attempted to do.  I wanted to write
three different ones: Minor Changes I, to modify Power 1 Rules (which has 
already been protoed), and Minor Changes II and III, to modify Rules of Power
2 and 3.

The following proto started out as Minor Changes II, but the changes I wanted
to make to Power 2 Rules were not minor enough to justify a Disinterested
Proposal.  The only 'minor' change I could justify in Power 2 Rules was a 
change of capitalization, which is certainly not enough even for a Disinterested
Proposal.  

----------
This Protoproposal shall have AI=2.
In this Protoproposal, every line beginning with a hash (#) shall be 
considered a comment, and shall have no effect.

Protoproposal h014 (Entities) 

Create a Rule of Power 2, titled "Definition of X Entity", reading:

	An X Entity, where X is some word, is a member of the subclass
	X of Entities.  An Entity is not an X Entity unless so designated
	by the Rules.

	Except for 'X' and 'Nomic', a reference to an X Entity in a Rule or
	Rules implies the existence of the subclass X of Entities.

	'Nomic Entity' and 'Entity' are unambiguous synonyms of one another.

Create a Rule, titled "Definition of Privileged Action", reading:
	
	The Rules may define a Privileged Action for any subclass of 
	Entities.  No two subclasses of Entities may have the same 
	Privileged Action.

	For each subclass X of Entities and Privileged Action Y 
	corresponding to X: Only X Entities may perform Y.  X Entities
	are generally authorized to perform Y.  However, other Rules may
	withdraw this authorization in specific circumstances from an
	X Entity without that Entity ceasing to be X.

Change the title of Rule 206 to "Voting Entities and Proposing Entities.
Repeal Rule 1605.

Amend Rule 206 to read:

	The Privileged Action for Voting Entities is voting on Proposals.
	The Privileged Action for Proposing Entities is making Proposals.

	Each Voting Entity has two votes on each Proposal, unless another
	Rule indicates otherwise.  However, no such Entity shall have
	more than five votes on any Proposal, other Rules notwithstanding.

	Any Entity which is Voting or Proposing must have an Executor in 
	order to perform its Privileged Action, other Rules notwithstanding.

Replace the first two paragraphs of Rule 1889 with text reading:

	Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter, but not both.  

	Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that person
	has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time within the
	12 months prior to this registration, e is a Voter.

	A Legislator is a Proposing Entity.  A Voter is a Voting Entity.
