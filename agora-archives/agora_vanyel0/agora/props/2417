PROPOSAL 2417 (Wes)
Procedure to Replace an Officer

Amend Rule 1486 to read:

     If at any time a Petition is posted to the Public Forum which
     contains the Signatures of more than one half of the Active Players
     in Agora Nomic which states that a particular Player shall be
     installed into a particular Office, then that Player shall
     immediately fill that Office. If another Player already holds that
     Office, then that Player is first removed from that Office.

[Solves the current "Crisis" without need for complex Referenda Rules.]
