PROPOSAL 2424 (Morendil)
Fix COE obligation

Amend Rule 1431 by replacing the word "shall" in the first sentence
with the words "shall at eir discretion".

[Comments: the current version requires you to make a COE if you
believe a document to be in error. Of course, only a die-hard
Pragmatist would Judge TRUE if one were CFJed on a Violation of
1431, but it's perhaps better to be on the safe side...

Protoed on Jan. 6 under the same title.]
