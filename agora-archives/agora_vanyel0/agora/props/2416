PROPOSAL 2416 (Wes)
Petitions

Enact a Rule with the Title "Petitions" which reads as follows:

     Let there be an Entity known as a Petition which consists of any a
     body of text designated as a Petition. Let there be an Entity
     known as a Signature which shall be contained by a Petition and
     which shall consist of the Name of a single Player.

     Any Player may create a Petition at any time, but all Petitions
     must be in writing (or otherwise recorded in print media). Once
     created, a Petition may not be changed in any way except to add
     Signatures. A Player may destroy eir own Petition at any time. Once
     created, the Player which created it shall keep a record of that
     Petition and all Signatures until it is destroyed, and shall be
     known as the Owner of that Petition.

     Any Player may create a Signature within a particular Peition which
     consists of eir Name by notifying the Owner of the Petition that e
     wishes to do so in a message which includes the full text of the
     Petition. A Player may only create one Signature to be added to any
     single Petition, and the Signature which e creates shall be known
     as eir Signature.

     If a Player claims that a Petition which e Owns contains the
     Signature of a Player whose Signature it does not contain, that
     Player shall be Guilty of a Class D Crime. Claiming that a Petition
     contains such Signatures does not change its legal status in any
     way.

[This forms the basis for a new way of dealing with a number of issues,
including Impeachment, Policy Reports, Appeals, and a few other things
which have not yet been dealt with. It has the advantage of leaving the
burden of labor up to the Player initiating the action, and it's fairly
simple. Most of the language is to make references to Petitions and
Signatures easier.

The last paragraph should provide all the failsafe needed, as long as
all Rules dealing with Petitions refer to Petitions which have
Signatures rather than Players claiming to have Petitions which have
Signatures.]
