Proposal 2645 (Steve, AI=1)

Clarify Delegation

[Comment: Failed quorum first time around. Let's try again, shall we?]

[Comment: Rule 1645 could be and should be clearer than it is about
the Delegating Player ceasing to hold the Delegated Office during
the PoD. This Proposal clarifies matters appropriately.]

Amend Rule 1645 by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      A Delegated Player holds the Delegated Office temporarily
      during the Period of Delegation, and earns the Salary for that
      Office as described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegating Player resumes holding the Delegated
      Office in the normal fashion, unless the Term of Service for
      that Office has expired,

with text which reads:

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office in
      the normal fashion, unless the Term of Service for that Office
      has expired.
