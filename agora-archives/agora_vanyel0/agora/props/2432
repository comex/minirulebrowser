PROPOSAL 2432 (favor)
Criminals are Ninnies

  In Rule 908/4, change the text

    to be in violation of one or more Rules,

  to read

    to be in violation of one or more Rules, or to have
    committed one or more Crimes,

(Comment: Most of the currently-defined Crimes are Rule violations
anyway, so this is currently redundant, but in future we might
want to have some Crimes that are not Rule violations, and it'd
be most fun to make the Criminals apologize just as we make
current Rule violators apologize.)
