PROPOSAL 2421 (Steve)
Org_a_nizations

In Rule 1528, replace the word "Orginization" with "Organization".
In Rule 1533, replace the word "Orginization" with "Organization".
In Rule 1397, replace the word "Orginization" with "Organization".

[Comment: I offered this to Swann two months ago to propose, but as he
has declined to act on it, I will now do so.]
