PROPOSAL 2427 (Swann)
New Players and Votes.

Let the following Rule be Created (Players must be subscribed for the
entire Voting Period):

    No Player may Vote on any Proposal whose Voting Period began before
    eir Registration, or whose Voting Period ends after eir
    deregistration. If such a Player Votes on such a proposal, those
    Votes have no effect and are not counted by the Assessor.

    This Rule takes precidence over all other Rules defining which
    Players can Vote on a Proposal.

[Comment: Cleaning out my Proposal bin.  This was written with the
          nucleon event in mind. (ie, Register, Vote, deregister, same
          message)]
