=============================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals
=============================================================================

Proposal 2745 by Swann
A pair of minor SLC/Org fixes

Rule 1534 is amended to read as follows:

     An Organization's SLC is empowered to require Currency transfers 
     from the Organization's Treasury, in addition to other transfers 
     its SLC is permitted to require.

     The Player required to detect and report any transfers required
     by the Organization's SLC shall be whatever Player within the SLC's
     Jurisdiction the SLC assigns this duty to, or the Organization's
     Executor if no specification is made.

{Comment: Apparently a declaration was missing from my SLC/Org proposal,
          turning this amendment into a string of meaningless text.}

Rule 1457 is amended by replacing the word "Compact" with "SLC"

{Comment: the last wayward Compact.}

======================================================================

Proposal 2747 by favor
No EVs for Disinterested Proposals

The first paragraph of Rule 1047/3 (the Zeitgeist Rule) is
hereby amended to read:

  When a Proposal made by some Player is adopted unanimously
  (that is, no votes are cast AGAINST it), and the Proposal
  is not a Disinterested Proposal, and the Proposer of that
  Proposal is a Player, then that Proposal's Proposer is
  awarded the Patent Title of Zeitgeist.  All current holders of
  the Title of Zeitgeist lose the Title whenever it is newly
  awarded.  The Assessor is responsible for detecting the award of
  this Title and reporting it to the Registrar.

(Comment: there's still a slight incentive to vote Against even
Disinterested Proposals, if it seems likely that the Proposer
will thereby get Zeitgeist and an EV.  This would close that
hole.  I thought I already proposed this, but I guess not!)

======================================================================

Proposal 2748 by favor
Fix Missing Noun Phrase in Oracle Rule

Rule 1521 is hereby amended, by changing the text "10 Mil
and are" to read "10 Mil and one Extra Vote are".

(Comment: Dunno how *that* happened!)

======================================================================

Proposal 2749 by favor
Make Rule 1624 reasonable

Rule 1624 is hereby amended by changing the text "As soon
as possible after the beginning of any Nomic Week" to read
"As soon as possible after the end of any Nomic Week".

(Comment: The current Rule requires the Tabulator to do something
ASAP after the *beginning* of any Week in which a certain
thing happens.  Since it's impossible to tell whether or
not that thing will happen during the Week until the *end*
of the Week, this seems unreasonable, and Tabulators have
no doubt been violating ASAP for a long time!)

======================================================================

Proposal 2750 by Chuck
Revise Concurring/Dissenting Opinions to Use Applications

This Proposal contains one proposed Rule Change and zero Directives.

I.  Rule 1365 shall be amended to read:

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labelled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

[In addition to revising Concurring/Dissenting Opinions to use
 Applications, this Proposal also allows Opinions to be submitted
 on Dismissals as well as Judgements.]
