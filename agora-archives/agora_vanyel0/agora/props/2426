PROPOSAL 2426 (Swann)
Fix the @#!$%&* Speaker/Voter distinction [protoed]

Amend Rule 103 to read as follows:

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Peer or the
      Speaker; no Player may simultaneously be a Peer and a Speaker.
      At any time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player"
      in the Rules shall specifically include both the Peers and the
      Speaker.

The Title of Rule 103 shall be Changed from "The Speaker and Voters" to
"The Speaker and the Peers."

The following Rules are hereby amended by replacing each instance of the
word "Voter" with the word "Peer" and by replacing each instance of
the word "Voters" with the word "Peers":

    Rule 1043, Rule 1042, Rule  112, Rule  724, Rule 1433, Rule 785
    Rule  942, Rule  786, Rule  402, Rule 1427

[Comment:  I think I've finally come up with a word that is
           appropriate, sounds ok, and contains no misleading or
           unpleasant connotations.  Pelease note this is AI = 3.]
