PROPOSAL 2430 (favor)
Misers

  Let there be a Rule entitled "Misers", with the following text:

    Every Player is either a Miser or a non-Miser.  Every Player
    is a non-Miser at the time e Registers, and every Player
    becomes a non-Miser whenever a new Game begins.  A Player
    becomes a Miser by announcing to the Public Forum that e
    is doing so.

    Whenever a Miser's Treasury contains any Points, those
    Points are immediately, without any delay or intervening
    events, converted to Marks, at the primary Mark Exchange
    Rate.

(Comment: this is the flip-side of the Gladiators proto that
someone did awhile back.  Misers give up the ability to Win
by Points, and gain instant and automatic Mark conversion.
I first thought of this back when kelly was about to Win
by Points: in the same Voting Results that gave her her
Win, I got quite a few Points.  I didn't have a chance
to exchange them at the primary Exchange Rate, because
the Game ended immediately after I got them.  If I'd been
a Miser, this wouldn't have happened.

Note that once you declare yourself a Miser, you remain
one for the duration of the current Game.  This is to
keep Players from flip-flopping for tactical reasons.)
