PROPOSAL 2428 (Morendil)
*** Special Report on Transfers ***

Being also a Thesis respectfully submitted to the Agoran
Community for the purpose of Requesting a Degree of Associate
of Nomic, to be awarded to Player Morendil. The Proposal containing
a Directive to Request this Degree is hereby submitted to H.
Promotor, as the first line and first paragraph of this message.

Morendil, Jan. 18, 1996

The following report lists all Rules that specify Transfers
of Currencies, listed by Rule Number and including their
Class, reporting Officer and/or Player and time of occurrence.

The second part attempts to list all problems that arise from our
present Currency Rules.

As a conclusion, I endeavor to put across my personal impressions of
how the game has evolved as regards the Agoran Economy.

An annotation of ??? means the time of occurence is extremely
unclear, mainly due to some Transfers unexpectedly being Class
III. An annotation of ? means the t.o.o. is merely in doubt, and
shall probably be determined by Game Custom.

Class III Transfers normally occur when they are reported. Class
III's marked '???' *should* occur at the time listed, but in fact
are Point Transfers and as a result of 1479 occur at the time they
are reported.

For Class I Transfers, the prevailing theory is that they occur
when the requirement for them to occur starts. Most Class I's
marked '?' are Transfers for which no time is otherwise specified.

Comments :

The two Transfers mandated by 951 have a very dubious status. A Player
who declines to Judge must lose 2 Points, i.e. becomes required to
make a Class III Transfer of 2 Points to the Bank. Then one Class I
Transfer occurs, from the Bank to the CotC, at a time which I have not
been able to determine (the requirement for this Transfer starts at
the time the Player posts a message declining to Judge, but if e does
not make eir Class III Transfer right away, does the CotC get eir
Point immediately ?)

Rule 911 unfortunately does not allow Justices to earn eir salary
since no Player is required to d/r such Transfers.
Rule 840's 1-Mark Transfer cannot occur since no Player is required
to d/r it.

Starting Marks (1080) are unfortunately not transferred, since no
Player is required to d/r such Transfers.

Rule 1543 unfortunately does not award The Wizard eir EV Salary, for
two reasons : a) no Player is required to d/r it, b) it conflicts
with 1479 which requires Salaries to be Points. All the sadder since
that was my own first Rule ! ;(

Rule 1465 is broken in the same way, and that truly is a shame. ;)

Rule 1469 apparently does not forbid destruction of Treasuries, but
exposes the Banker to a severe risk of violating TIA, or 1469 itself.

Rule 1490 runs afoul of a small problem : by Rule 459, any automatic
change which occurs weekly occurs at the beginning of the NW. If the
transfer of Points to a Player who has held the Potato for a full week
comes under this Rule's purview, then the transfer occurs at the
beginning of that NW, otherwise it occurs at the end.

I wonder if the transfers mandated by Rule 1518, i.e. purchase of
Powers, might not be illegal. After all, it's not clear whether 1517's
assigment of d/r transfers resulting from the *use* of Powers also
applies to purchasing or trading them.

One or two Rules call for occasion under which Transfers might be
'reversed', which given the current state of our Currency Rules I
believe may be highly problematic : I am thinking of the 'reversing'
of penalties for Infractions and of the 'forfeiting' of a Judge's
rewards if eir Judgement is overturned uppon Appeal.


A Word of Conclusion

I have recently been reading Steve's Summaries of the early history of
Agora, back when it was still Nomic World. In addition to proving
highly entertaining, Steve's Summaries confirm that the Agoran Economy
has been a focus of legislative action since the very start of the
game. At some point, Steve also notes that the then-embryonic Group
Rules could be illuminating as an example of how 'corporate law' may
naturally evolve in a legal system. I think Agoran History has proven
Steve right, in that our Currency Rules have now become as complex an
edifice - relative to the scale of our own community - as RL law is in
financial matters.

I think we should now take a step back and think again about Reforming
our current Currency Rules. I hope this document will be of some
assistance in the process.
