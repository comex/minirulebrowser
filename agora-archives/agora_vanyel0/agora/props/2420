PROPOSAL 2420 (Wes)
Petition to Replace the Speaker

Amend Rule 785 to read:

     If at any time a Petition is posted to the Public Forum containing
     the Signatures of more than 2/3 of the Active Players in Agora
     Nomic which states that a particular Player should be installed as
     Speaker, that Player shall immediately become the Speaker. E shall
     make a reasonable effort to obtain all necessary materials from the
     previous Speaker (or from any other available source).

Then, Repeal Rule 942.

[This is just as effective as any other method, is much simpler, and
takes care of two problems with one Rule. It does allow for the
replacement of a Speaker for any reason, but requires a 2/3 majority to
do so. It also requires absolutely no Officer intervention to be
successful.]
