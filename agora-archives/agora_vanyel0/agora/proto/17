All right, then:

PROTO-Proposal DB17 (Vanyel)
Proposal Limits
(Amends a Rule)

Amend [whatever the proposal rule is] to read:

Each Player shall have a Proposal queue.  Any time a Player sends a
Proposal to the Speaker, eir Proposal is added to eir queue.

In any Nomic Week no more than 30 Proposals may be up for Vote.  If there
are less than 30 Proposals in the Proposal queues of all Players, then all
will be cleared from their queues and added to the for-Vote queue.  If more
than 30 Proposals are sent to the Speaker, then e shall go through the
following process to determine which are added to the for-Vote queue:
     1)	E shall make a list of all Players in descending order by Honour.
     2)	E shall go through the list and remove all Players without any
	Proposals in eir queue.
     3) E shall go through the list in order, taking the first Proposal
	in the queue of each Player and adding it to the for-Vote queue
	until the for-Vote queue is full (30 Proposals).
     4) If the Speaker completes the list, having taken one Proposal from
	each Player's Proposal queue, e shall return to Step 2 and repeat.
After the Speaker has determined which Proposals would go in the for-Vote
queue, e shall post the Proposals in the queue to the Public Forum and
clear the for-Vote queue.

The only way a Proposal may be prematurely removed from a Player's 
Proposal Queue is if e, the Player, specifically requests such to the
Speaker.  The Player may not replace a Proposal with another; if e
removes it from the queue, all lower positions move up one to clear
the hole.  Such a removal is irrevocable.

In certain special cases, a Player may want a block of Proposals to 
be certain of being proposed at the same time; this may be done by
sending a message to the Speaker requesting to "Clump" certain Proposals.
These Proposals *must* be adjacent in the Player's Proposal queue.
In order to Clump Proposals, a Player must pay .5 Mark for 5 or less
Proposals or 1 Mark for 10 or less.  No Clumps may be of more than
10 Proposals.  If the Speaker has received more than 30 requests and
is cycling through the Player's queues, and he comes across one proposal
of a Clump, all Proposals in the Clump shall be moved to the for-Vote
queue, unless there are more than (30-(Number of Proposals in Clump))
Proposals already in the for-Vote queue, in which case *no* Proposals
from the Clump shall be added to the for-Vote queue.
***END PROTO

proposal history:
first proto 7 Oct 12:35 PM CDT

This takes care of all the problems I've noticed with limits.  (Oh, btw,
is 30 too steep?  I wasn't sure.)  Things to notice: All players should
get at least one proposal in; the players that miss out are the least
honourable ones (the honourable ones are more likely to propose beneficial
reform).  Proposals remain in a Player's Proposal Queue, unless they
request that they be removed.  "Clumps" enable packages to pass through
legislation.

Comments, questions?

10 Proposals is a pretty big clump!

Good idea, but I fear it might be too much additional work to maintain.

But which can probably be broken up into groups of 5-10.  I note that
the rate is graduated, so that little Clumps cost less than major Clumps...

Yes, at the beginning of a Nomic Week; I'll specify that in my next revision.
As for "separate queues" that is merely to keep the legalese straight; if the
Speaker wants he may merely maintain a chronological list of proposals, and
by whom.  The "queue" may be purely mental.  It's just there to clear up
the language later on.

It made sense to me.  I couldn't figure out any other reasonable criterion.

Not really.

Effectively, the bookkeeping could be the same as it is now.  The only 
difference is the Speaker would need a handy list of Honour.

Perhaps the Speaker should just ask each player in turn which proposal e
would like to submit.

I also think 10 proposals are a big clump, considering there are only 30
proposals in all.

I like this, but I have a comment or two:

> ...
> In any Nomic Week no more than 30 Proposals may be up for Vote.

Actually it works out conveniently to have as many proposals as there
are registered players at the beginning of the week.  Otherwise if
we ever grow to 60 players we could easily have half the players
unable to propose.
 

> In order to Clump Proposals, a Player must pay .5 Mark for 5 or less
> Proposals or 1 Mark for 10 or less.  No Clumps may be of more than
> 10 Proposals.

Marks are too chaotic right now.  Let the payment be in points, and
let it be a flat 3 points per proposal, up to a limit of 10; and 
make that an actual payment--don't allow the clumping unless the
player appears to have enough points.

========================

Actually, here's an interesting question:  as Scorekeepor, I sometimes
get a request from the Speaker asking how many points a certain player
has.  The response is used to decide whether to allow the player to 
send points to the Vototron.

Now what if some monstrous CFJ goes through, affecting all the scores
retroactively in various ways?  Then it could happen that the information I 
gave to the Speaker is wrong, and a player gets to use the Vototron that 
shouldn't have. This could easily affect the outcome of a vote.

For certain decisions (like: Vototron, or the clumping payment),
could we maybe allow the Speaker to rely on best evidence (such as
the most recent undisputed Scorekeepor's report), and not have his 
decision changed even if the report was not quite correct?

Anyway, I do like Vanyel's idea.

PROTO-Proposal DB17 (Vanyel)
Proposal Limits
(Amends a Rule)

Amend [whatever the proposal rule is] to read:

Each Player shall have a Proposal queue.  Any time a Player sends a
Proposal to the Speaker, eir Proposal is added to eir queue.  The
maximum number of Proposals up for Vote at any time may not be 
more than the number of Active Players at the beginning of the
current Nomic Week.  Proposals are to be put up for Vote exactly
once a week, as soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic
Week.  This takes precedence over any Rule which states otherwise.

If, when Proposals are being put up for vote, there are less than 
the maximum number of Proposals, then all will be cleared from the
Players' queues and added to the for-Vote queue.  If more than the
maximum are sent to the Speaker, then e shall go through the following
process to determine which Proposals are to be added to the for-Vote
queue:
     1)	E shall make a list of all Players in descending order by Honour.
     2)	E shall go through the list and remove all Players without any
	Proposals in eir queue.
     3) E shall go through the list in order, taking the first Proposal
	in the queue of each Player and adding it to the for-Vote queue
	until the for-Vote queue is full.
     4) If the Speaker completes the list, having taken one Proposal from
	each Player's Proposal queue, e shall return to Step 2 and repeat.
After the Speaker has determined which Proposals would go in the for-Vote
queue, e shall post the Proposals in the queue to the Public Forum and
clear the for-Vote queue.

The only way a Proposal may be prematurely removed from a Player's 
Proposal Queue is if e, the Player, specifically requests such to the
Speaker.  The Player may not replace a Proposal with another; if e
removes it from the queue, all lower positions move up one to clear
the hole.  Such a removal is irrevocable.

The Player may also request that a Proposal authored by eim
be removed from the Vote in the Public Forum; the Speaker shall post
a message to the Public Forum stating that said Proposal has been
removed from the Vote.  The Proposal is then discarded.  

[This allows people to replace Proposals already for Vote.  It does not,
however, confusingly renumber anything, or allow them to change the 
Proposal after it has been partially Voted on.  They may remove their
Proposal from the Vote, but must resubmit their revision at the end
of the queue.]

In certain special cases, a Player may want a block of Proposals to 
be certain of being proposed at the same time; this may be done by
sending a message to the Speaker requesting to "Clump" certain Proposals.
These Proposals *must* be adjacent in the Player's Proposal queue.
In order to Clump Proposals, a Player must pay 1 Pt. per Proposal for
less than 5 Proposals, 2 Pts. per Proposal for 5-10 Proposals, or
3 Pts. per Proposal for >10 Proposals.  No Clumps may be of more than
15 Proposals.  If the Speaker has received more than 30 requests and
is cycling through the Player's queues, and he comes across one proposal
of a Clump, all Proposals in the Clump shall be moved to the for-Vote
queue, unless that would put more than the maximum number of Proposals
in the queue, in which case *no* Proposals from the Clump shall be
added to the for-Vote queue.
***END PROTO

proposal history:
first proto 7 Oct 12:35 PM CDT
second proto 14 Oct 5:43 PM CDT

This should take care of all the limit problems.  Things to notice:
each player will have a chance at at *least* one Proposal, the people
who propose less are only shafted by *one*, the people who propose
most are the most honourable, Proposals cannot be removed by anyone
except the Player who proposed them, and that Player can remove them
at any time, "Clump"ing is tightly defined, the implementation of
"queues" is entirely up to the Speaker (i.e. could be entirely a mental
thing).

Comments, questions?

Since Kelly seems to be finishing up her Reform, I think I'm about
ready to post the proposal suite I've been working up.  I will note
that it is designed to work on top of any type of voting/proposal
system; it merely augments.  Anyway, here are proposals DB17-[1-5].

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-1 (Vanyel)
Submission of Votes
Amend Rule 1036 to read as follows:

Each Player shall have a Proposal Queue.  Any time a Player sends
a Proposal to the Speaker, eir Proposal is added to eir Queue.
At the beginning of the Nomic Week, the maximum length of the
for-Vote Proposal Queue is set to the current number of Active
Players.  If at any time the total number of Proposals in all
Proposal Queues is less than this maximum length, then all Proposals
are cleared from the Player Queues and placed in the for-Vote Proposal
Queue.  If there are more Proposals than this limit, Proposals will
be placed in the for-Vote Queue only as determined elsewhere in the
Rules.  As Soon As Possible after the Proposals are placed in the
for-Vote Queue, the Speaker should assign each a Number and distribute
them to all Players for Voting.

All Proposals which are "put up for Vote" as specified elsewhere in
the Rules are placed in the for-Vote Proposal Queue iff that would
not fill the for-Vote Queue past its maximum; if it would, then those
Proposals are placed in a Priority Queue which must be emptied into
the for-Vote Queue before any other Proposals may be placed there.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-2 (Vanyel)
Determining Order of Votes

If the total number of Proposals in existence exceeds the maximum
number allowed in the for-Vote Proposal Queue, the Speaker shall go
through the following process to determine which Proposals to put in
the for-Vote Proposal Queue:
     1)	E shall make a list of all Players in descending order by Honour.
     2)	E shall go through the list and remove each Player without any
	Proposals in eir Proposal Queue.
     3) E shall go through the list in order, taking the first Proposal
	in the queue of each Player and adding it to the for-Vote Queue
	until the for-Vote Queue is full.
     4) If the Speaker completes the list, having taken one Proposal from
	each Player's Proposal queue, e shall return to Step 2 and repeat.
Once e has filled the for-Vote Proposal Queue, e shall follow any steps
specified elsewhere in the Rules which apply.

This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies another method of determining
which Votes to be put up for Vote.

If [Proto DB17-1] does not pass, then this Rule immediately will repeal 
itself.

PROTO-Proposal DB17-3 (Vanyel)
Proposal Retraction

The only way a Proposal may be prematurely retracted by a Player 
is if e, the Player, specifically requests such to the Speaker.
The Player may not replace a Proposal with another; if e retracts
it, e can only replace it by submitting another Proposal.  Any 
retractions shall discard a Proposal irrevocably.

The Player may also request that a Proposal authored by eim
be removed from the Proposals up for Vote by stating such to the Public 
Forum.  In such a case, any points which would be received as a direct
result of that Proposal shall be distributed; then, that Proposal
will be irrevocably retracted.  Any points which have been spent on
Vototron contributions are returned, and any Votes cast for that
Proposal shall be disregarded.

PROTO-Proposal DB17-4 (Vanyel)
Proposal Clumping

A Player may decide to Clump a group of Proposals which were adjacently
Proposed (i.e. with no other Proposals between or among them).  E must
pay a fee for this; 1 point per Proposal for a Clump of less than 7
Proposals, or 3 points per Proposal for Clumps of at least 7.  No
Clumps may be of more than 15 Proposals.

If for some reason not all Proposals in existence shall be Voted
on, then if the Speaker selects any one Proposal of the Clump to
be put up for Vote, all of the Proposals of the Clump are put up
for Vote  If it is the case that this would put too many Proposals
up for Vote, then none of the Proposals in the Clump are put up for
Vote.

Proposals in a Clump are voted on separately, and all point changes
involving them are dealt with separately, however all of the
Proposals in a Clump must Pass, or else none take effect.  In other
words, if a single Proposal in a Clump Fails, then all shall Fail.
This does not affect point changes such as F-A bonuses in any way.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-5 (Vanyel)
Repeal 1065

Rule 1065 shall be Repealed.  [Proposal fees for >2 props.]

The previous versions of these protoes were all in a single proto;
I separated them on the request of (I believe) Kelly.  I have modified
a couple details to compensate for changes since mid-October, and I've
made them as independent of each other as possible, so in the final
Suite you needn't worry about voting for one and not another; this 
should be alright.  The only Proto which depends on another is DB17-2;
it requires DB17-1.  Let me stress, in the wake of CFJ 715, that the
"Player Proposal Queues" and stuff doesn't *have* to be anything more
than a mental construct in the mind of the Speaker...

Significant Changes:  Everything.  In 17-1, I have eliminated all mentions
of Queues (happy, Kelly? :), although technically what is described is a
Queue.  The order of determination of whose proposals get distributed is
first-come, first-serve.

I have added the "Emergency Proposal"... it carries a rather stiff penalty
(not being able to Propose for a Week), but if the cause is sufficient, it
should be fine.  If it passes, the Proposer receives eir 10 point penalty
back, and a 5 point bonus besides.

Proposal Retraction is essentially the same as before (what does anyone
think of that, anyway..?)

Instead of Clumping I have introduced Linking... which is one-way, and
can depend on other Players' Proposals, as well.  For two Proposals
which a Player wants mutually Linked, the fee is 2 points; beyond that,
it would be easier just to use multi-Part Proposals.  Linking is very
versatile;  for a group of five proposals, one of which is independent
and the other four of which are dependent on the first (but not each
other), Linking is definitely the way to go.  Also, if your Proposal
depends on another Proposal by Player Foo which was distributed three
days ago, you can Link that way too.  Fee is merely 1 point.

The Extra fee for more Proposals rule is still repealed in proto 17-5,
and the Speaker is legislated to distribute once a week or every ten
proposals... 

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-1 (Vanyel)
Submission of Votes
Amend Rule 1036 to read as follows:

The maximum number of distributed Proposals shall be the number of
Active Players at the beginning of the Nomic Week.  Proposals shall
be sent to the Speaker.  When it is time (as specified elsewhere)
for the Speaker to distribute Proposals, e shall distribute as many
as possible without exceeding the Proposal limit, beginning with
those Proposals submitted first.

Any Proposal which, according to another Rule, is "put up for Vote",
shall be distributed As Soon As Possible by the Speaker.  This may
cause an excess of Proposals; this is disregarded in this case only.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-2 (Vanyel)
Emergency Proposal

If a Player deems a Proposal important e may submit it as an Emergency
Proposal.  In order to do this, e must pay a fee of 10 Points and must
forego Proposing anything else (including another Emergency Proposal)
for a full week.  If e submits a Proposal during this time it shall
be considered improperly submitted, and shall not be Voted on.  An 
Emergency Proposal shall be put up for Vote immediately.  If the
Emergency Proposal passes, the Player shall receive 15 Points.  

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent 
Emergency Proposals from being submitted, distributed, or Voted on.

PROTO-Proposal DB17-3 (Vanyel)
Proposal Retraction

The only way a Proposal may be prematurely retracted by a Player 
is if e, the Player, specifically requests such to the Speaker.
The Player may not replace a Proposal with another; if e retracts
it, e can only replace it by submitting another Proposal.  Any 
retractions shall destroy a Proposal irrevocably.

The Player may also request that a Proposal authored by em
be removed from the Proposals up for Vote by stating such to the Public 
Forum.  In such a case, any points which would be received as a direct
result of that Proposal shall be distributed; then, that Proposal
will be irrevocably retracted.  Any points which have been spent on
Vototron contributions are returned, and any Votes cast for that
Proposal shall be disregarded.

PROTO-Proposal DB17-4 (Vanyel)
Proposal Linking

A Player may Link a Proposal made by em to any other.  This is
accomplished by a message to the Speaker or to the Public Forum, and
requires a fee of 1 Point.  If the Proposal which was Linked to does
not pass, then the Proposal which was Linked does not take effect.
This does not affect F-A bonuses.

This Rule takes precedence over Rule 955.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-5 (Vanyel)
Repeal 1065

Rule 1065 shall be Repealed.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB17-6 (Vanyel)
Distribution of Proposals

The Speaker shall distribute Proposals if and only if the following 
conditions are met:
	-There are more than 10 undistributed Proposals, or any undistributed
	 Proposals older than six days old, and
	-The limit on Proposals (if any) has not been met.
