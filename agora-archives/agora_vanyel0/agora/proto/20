In light of the recent MI controversy, and the fogeyNet complaining about
the complexity of Kelly's system, and Kelly complaining about MI's...

Proto-PROPOSAL DB20 (Vanyel)
Indices
(Creates a Rule)

Each Rule shall have an Index.  Every Rule starts with an Index of 1.  In
order to Amend or Repeal a Rule, the number of Votes (For/Against) the
Proposal to do so must be >= the Index of that Rule.  The Index of a Rule
may be changed by a proposal stating such; the (F/A) of this Proposal must
be >= the current Index or the Proposed Index, whichever is greater.

Any Rule which has a higher Index than another automatically takes precedence
unless it specifically yields it.  If a Rule has the same Index as another,
whichever has the lower Rule Number automatically takes precedence unless
it specifically yields it.  If a Rule would normally take precedence and
does not claim precedence over another, but the other claims precedence
over it, then the other takes precedence.
***

Now tell me, what's missing?  For NPRC's, the original proposal's Voting
determines whether or not it works.  EVERYTHING WORKS THE SAME, I'm
pretty sure.  Oh, I forgot--there should be a second proto to repeal the
20 or so Rules it replaces...
