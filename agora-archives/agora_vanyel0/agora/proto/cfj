PROTO-Proposal DB-CFJ (Vanyel)
Anyone can CFJ

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 991 is Amended to read as follows: 

      Judgment may be Invoked on the interpretation or application of
      a Rule by submitting a Statement for Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  Such a Call for Judgment is automatically Valid if the
      Submittor (the person who submitted the CFJ) is a Player and has
      not yet submitted five CFJ's during that Nomic Week.  A CFJ is
      automatically Invalid if the Submittor has submitted five CFJ's
      already during that Nomic Week.  If the Submittor is not a 
      Player but has not submitted five CFJs in that week, the CFJ may
      or may not be Invalid, at the CotC's discretion.

      For all Valid CFJs, the CotC must select a Judge as described in
      the Rules as soon as possible.  E must then distribute the Statement
      to be judged, along with the identity of the Submittor and the Judge,
      to all Players.

=====
Actually, this fixes quite a few problems which I noticed in this Rule.
First of all, it removes this nonsense about "disagreements"--in the
current version of the Rule, any Player can insist on a disagreement 
anyway.  Second, it links the term "Call for Judgment" with "Invoking
Judgment", which previously wasn't the case (!).  Also, currently the
CotC is in no way obligated to distribute the name of the Submittor,
so far as I can see.  I've fixed the spelling of "Judgment", too, although
I can switch it back if anyone really wants me to.

Finally, I added the ability of a non-Player to submit a CFJ.  I have
given the CotC the power to ignore such, to avoid frivolous CFJing by
some non-Player, although if the Watcher has a valid concern that the
CotC ignores, I'm sure the Watcher could find a patron among the Players.
So really, it's just a matter of expediency--it saves the time it would
take for a Watcher to post to n-d or n-b and some Player to submit a CFJ
by proxy.

I made it super-easy for future amendments to make a CFJ Invalid, by
separating the first and second paragraphs and defining the concepts of
a "Valid" CFJ, as opposed to an "Invalid" CFJ.

As stated your Proto does not indicate that a CFJ may be invalid for 
other reasons. In fact it might conflict with other Rules trying to add 
requirements to CFJs.

Er, I actually prefer "Judgement", although I recognize that either spelling
is acceptable. Assuming that one spelling or the other is currently used
predominantly in the Ruleset, I could live with a standardization to whichever
spelling is currently most used.

NO.

If a Watcher wants to CFJ let em become a Player. There is no reason to do
this, and since a Watcher is of informal status, this encourages abuse.

Becoming a Player is easy enough.
