IMHO, this is the root of the issue.  "Nomic Entity" and "Entity" are 
ambiguous in the Ruleset.  There is no question that a Person is an
Entity, but is e a *Nomic* Entity?  I think yes, because it is mentioned
in the Rules.  However, I can see where some would think otherwise.  In
any case, this is something we MUST agree on.

Proto-PROPOSAL DB16 (Vanyel)
Entities and Attributes
(Creates a Rule)

  Anything defined in this Ruleset may fall into one of two categories:
Entities and Attributes.  Anything which may be defined as a quality of
something else is an Attribute.  Anything else is an Entity.  An Entity
may possess other Entities, as provided for in the Rules.
  Any Entity named in the Rules may be also known as a Nomic Entity.
  Current examples of Entities include: Persons, Marks, Points, Kudos,
Votes, Offices, and Groups.  Current examples of Attributes include: 
Sanity, Playerhood, Officerhood, Speakership, On-Holdness, etc.

***END PROTO

Whaddya think?  It pretty much codifies this argument (or rather, one
side of it) into law so that it can't be argued over anymore.  However,
I need to know that at least half of the Agorans will *vote* for it,
or I won't propose it.

If we want this Rule to include _everything_ that can be defined in the 
Ruleset, then we need a few more categories.
We have a category for nouns: Entities; a category for adjectives: 
Attributes; We need one for Verbs: Actions/Events come to mind.
Also, "as soon as possible" would belong to the category for adverbs,
what should we call it? Could that pass under Attributes too?

Otherwise, I like the idea.

We could have Attributes be adjectives *or* adverbs, in which case ASAP
could be an Attribute of an *Action*.  I'll see what I can do about this
in my proto.

Reproto:  (I'm posting to yoyo cuz not everyone's resubbed to teleport yet...)

Proto-PROPOSAL DB16 (Vanyel)
Terminology
(Creates a Rule)

  Any word used in any official Nomic posting falls into one of two
categories: Common-usage words and Nomic-specific words.  Some words
that do exist outside the context of Agora have been redefined and are
Nomic-specific, and some have been invented.  Any common-usage word
can be assumed to mean the same thing as it does outside of Agora.
  Nomic-specific words fall into three categories:
    Attributes:  Attributes refine the meaning of another thing.  An
	Attribute defines a quality of either an Entity or Action;
	for example, Officerhood is an Attribute which may apply to
	Players, while "as soon as possible" is an Attribute of an
	Action.
    Entities:  Entities are things which exist in and of themselves,
	within Agora only or both inside and out of Agora.  An Entity
	may possess other Entities; for example, a Group may possess
	Points.  Any Entity referred to in the Rules may also be known
	as a Nomic Entity.
    Actions/Events:  This third class of Nomic words is somewhat
	nebulous; it refers to things which must happen.  An Action
	or Event may possess an attribute such as "as soon as possible".
  It should be noted that Entities are the least common denominators
of objects; Players are not Entities in and of themselves, they are
Persons with the Attribute of Playerhood, what was once known as a
Sane Proposal was really just a Proposal with the Attribute of Sanity.
  A non-exclusive list of Nomic words and their classifications follow:
    Attributes: Playerhood, Officerhood, Speakerhood, Being On-Hold,
	Judgehood, Patent Titled
    Entities: Persons, Marks, Points, Kudos, Votes, Offices, the Speakership,
	Groups, Rules, CFJs, Posts to the Public Forum
    Actions/Events: Posting of Reports, Announcing Proposals, Revealing
	Vote Results, Marks Transfers, Points Transfers, Kudo Transfers, 
	Voting, Calling For Judgement, Posting to the Public Forum
  The discreet Agoran will note that Entities often have Actions which
correspond to them.  E will also note that this list is by no means
comprehensive, and that due to Rule Changes some items listed may not
be legal or may in fact no longer exist.  However, this list should
give a strong guideline for determining the type of Terms being used.

!(Creates a Rule)

Well, I have a lot of problems with this proto, but they are more of a
general than specific nature.  First of all, what is the problem this
is supposed to solve?  I don't think there is one, really.  Secondly,
there is nothing here which would work against a CFJ that the Vototron
is an Attribute, which is certainly not the case.  That indicates how
loose and inconsequential the proto is as it is written.  I just don't
think we need this.

Cheers!
Nomic Entity
