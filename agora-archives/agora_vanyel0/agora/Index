   Agora is one specific instance on the net of Peter Suber's [1]Nomic.
   Agora Nomic has been continuously played since June 1993. We have just
   recently passed the 3500 mark for proposals. The ruleset is currently
   at just under 300 rules, and seems to be holding steady. We have
   around 20 Players, and always welcome more!
   
The Archives

   As Archivist, my job is to, well, keep archives. And here they are!
   Most of the more recent stuff should be in regular ASCII form; as
   things age I often compress them using gzip, so watch out for those
   binary files. If you need help, or a special compilation of info, or
   something in a different form, or any questions, mail me, the
   Archivist, at [2]blahedo@quincy.edu.
   
   Temporary note: Some things may have gotten jumbled in my move to
   Brown U.; if so, please send me a quick email and I'll fix it asap.

   Items of interest... (Some of these are off-site links, so I cannot
   guarantee that they will always be up.)
     * The [3]Listserver Logs contain recent discussion and other
       transmissions related to Agora.
     * The partial archive of [4]past CFJs may provide some insight into
       how the game is played.
     * Various [5]Theses sponsored by Agorans.
     * The [6]current Ruleset is maintained by Rulekeepor Chuck Carroll,
       and is the quintessential Agora Nomic document, telling everything
       you can or can't do.
     * The Agora Guidebook is good to read first, to get you acquainted
       with some of the more peculiar aspects of Agoranism. :) (Currently
       offline, under revision)
     * The [7]Officers' Reports contain the current state of things in
       Agora.
     * The [8]Proposal archive holds a bunch of old proposals.
     * The [9]Bio Page has email addresses, homepages, and lots of
       intra-Agoran and extra-Agoran biographical info, about Players,
       Watchers, and a few ex-Players.
