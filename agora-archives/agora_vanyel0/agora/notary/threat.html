<center><h1>Threat Ordinances</h1></center>

<ul>
<p><li><font size=+2>Basic Ordinances</font>
	<ol>
	<p><li><font size=+1>Always a Vizier.</font>
    If the other Ordinances do not legally specify a valid choice 
    for Vizier, the Vizier is the member whose name appears first 
    on the List of Members.  This Ordinance takes precedence over
    all other Ordinances.
    <p>
    The Ordinancekeepor shall be the same person as the Vizier.

	<p><li><font size=+1>Precedence of Ordinances.</font>
    Should two or more Ordinances conflict, the one created least
    recently takes precedence, except when otherwise clearly specified
    by the Ordinances.  For purposes of this Ordinance, the original
    Ordinances are created as of the moment of the original adoption
    of these Ordinances, in numerical order.  Amendment of an
    Ordinance does not affect its creation date for purposes of this
    Ordinance.

	<p><li><font size=+1>Vizier's Authority.</font>
    Whenever the Rules or the Ordinances require the group to take
    an action, the Vizier shall perform such action as Executor of 
    the Group.  In such cases, the Vizier shall certify to the 
    appropriate persons that the action is authorized by the Ordinances.
    Otherwise the Vizier does not act as Executor.
	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>Public Messages and Propositions</font>
	<ol start=4>
<p><li>Voting Members are defined to be those members of the group who 
    are not under Interdict, as described in other Ordinances.

<p><li>If a Voting Member sends a message to the Vizier with a 
    request that it be forwarded to all Voting Members, the Vizier
    shall do so as soon as possible.  A message so sent is known as
    a Public Message, as is any message sent to all Voting Members.

<p><li>A Proposition is defined to be a formal proposal of a type described 
    in the Ordinances and sent by a Voting Member in a Public Message.

<p><li>Active Members are those Voting members who are either not On Hold,
    or who have during the previous two weeks sent a Public Message, 
    either with regard to a Proposition or to the Group Vote on a Proposal, 
    or requesting to remain active;

<p><li>Generally, A Proposition is defined to be "adopted" when, within seven 
    days after it is sent in a Public Message, a majority of Active Members 
    sends a Public Message consenting to it.
    <p>
    Other Ordinances may define different conditions for adoption of
    specific types of Propositions.
    <p>
    The Vizier shall maintain a record of adopted Propositions.
	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>Powers of the Group</font>
	<ol start=9>
<p><li>A new member shall be admitted to the Group upon adoption of a 
    Proposition to do so, together with eir request to join the Group,
    provided the request is within 14 days before or after the adoption.

<p><li>A Voting Member shall be placed under Interdict, upon adoption 
    of a Proposition to do so; and e then ceases to be a Voting Member.
    The Interdict may be lifted from a member, upon adoption of a 
    Proposition to do so, and e then becomes a Voting Member.

<p><li>A new Ordinance may be created, or an existing Ordinance changed 
    or repealed, upon adoption of a Proposition to do so; except that
    no such Proposition may take effect without the consent of at least
    two members.

<p><li>Currencies may be spent from the Treasury by the Vizier, upon
    adoption of a Proposition to do so.

<p><li>The group shall elect to dissolve, upon adoption of a Proposition 
    to do so.

<p><li>The Vizier shall send a message to the Registrar requesting the
    group be renamed, upon adoption of a Proposition to rename the
    Group to a specified name.  The Vizier shall request the name 
    specified in the Proposition.

<p><li>A Member shall become Vizier, upon adoption of a Proposition to
    appoint that Member as Vizier.

<p><li>Should the group be dissolved, each Voting Member's personal share 
    of the Treasury, as defined in other Ordinances, is returned to em, 
    and the remainder is divided among the Voting Members as equally as 
    possible, with any leftover remainder going to the member whose name
    appears first on the List of Members.  Any member leaving the 
    Group for any other reason shall not receive any part of the Treasury.
	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>List of Members</font>
	<ol start=17>

<p><li>The List of Members shall be automatically changed in the following 
    ways:
		<ol type=a>
     <p><li>upon becoming Vizier, a member's name shall be moved 
           to the front of the list; 

     <p><li>upon going On Hold, a member's name shall be moved to the 
           end of the list;

     <p><li>upon coming Off Hold, upon eir request, or upon resigning 
           as Vizier, a member's name shall be moved after the name of 
           the last member not On Hold;

     <p><li>upon becoming a Voting Member, a player's name is placed
           after the name of the last member not On Hold;

     <p><li>upon ceasing to be a Voting Member, a member's name 
           is deleted from the list.

     <p><li>upon being nominated as Vizier's successor by the Vizier,
           a member's name shall be placed immediately after that
           of the Vizier.
		</ol>
    <p>The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to the List of Members.
	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>Specification of Vizier</font>
	<ol start=18>
<p><li>The Vizier may resign at any time; if at that time e appoints a 
    successor, that successor immediately becomes Vizier. However,
    the Vizier may nominate a successor without resigning immediately
    and in this case e remains Vizier.

<p><li>The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to the Viziership.
	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>The Treasury</font>
	<ol start=20>
<p><li>Voting Members may place any or all Currencies in the Group
    treasury, which shall be added to eir personal share.  The Vizier 
    shall return any portion of a Voting Member's personal share 
    upon request, as soon as possible, provided this is allowed by the 
    Rules and the state of the Treasury, and provided that the member
    is not in arrears to the Group as specified in the Ordinances.

<p><li>Coins of the Group may not be created.  Coins of the Group within
    the Group Treasury shall be destroyed at the option of the Vizier.

<p><li>Upon the creation of the Group, each member's personal share of the 
    Group Treasury is zero.
    <p>
    The Vizier shall maintain a record of changes to members' personal 
    shares of the Treasury, and of the Treasury itself.

	</ol>
<p><li><font size=+2>The Group Vote</font>
	<ol start=23>

<p><li>Whenever a Proposal is distributed to all players, the Vizier shall
    seek to determine the consensus opinion of how the Group Vote shall
    be cast.  Each Member shall express an opinion FOR or AGAINST the
    Proposal, or may decline to express an opinion.
    <p>
    If the a majority of the Active Members exressing an opinion have
    the same opinion, the Group shall cast one vote accordingly. The 
    Vizier shall so inform the Assessor.

<p><li>Whenever there are Extra Votes in the Group Treasury, Members
    not in arrears to the Group may indicate with their opinion on the 
    Group Vote, whether they favor using an Extra Vote FOR or AGAINST the 
    Proposal.  If a majority of the Active Members favor using an Extra 
    Vote, and this is in accord with the use of the Group's original vote, 
    then the Group shall cast one Extra Vote on the Proposal, in accordance 
    with the opinion. The Vizier shall so inform the Assessor.
    <p>
    In case the Voting Periods for several Proposals overlap, the Vizier 
    shall apply existing Extra Votes to the Proposals in increasing 
    numerical order.

<p><li>At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if there are fewer than 3 Extra
    Votes in the Group Treasury, one EV is transferred from each Member 
    to the Group Treasury.  The Vizier shall detect and report this transfer.
    <p>
    If in this case a member has no EV's then the member shall owe the EV's
    to the Treasury as arrears.  A member must always pay off eir arrears, 
    to whatever extent possible, within 7 days, by transferring EV's to the 
    treasury from any treasury under eir actual control.
    <p>
    The Vizier shall keep track of all members' arrears, if any.
