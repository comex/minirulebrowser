<center><h1>Secret Eka-Platonist Cabal Regulations</h1></center>
<ol>
<p><li>The Secret Eka-Platonist Cabal has one unique office,
known as the Exalted Master.  The Exalted Master is at
all times the Contestmaster.  These Statutes may be
changed at any time by the Exalted Master, as e sees fit.

<p><li>Any Player other than the Exalted Master may enter the
Jurisdiction of the Cabal only with the permission of the
Exalted Msater, who may require of the incoming Player any
payment that e sees fit.

<p><li>The Exalted Master may disburse any and all Currencies
in the Organization's Treasury, and any other resources
that may come under the control of the Cabal, as e sees
fit, at eir sole discretion.

<p><li>The Exalted Master may at any time issue a Writ of
Non-Compliance, by posting to the Agora Public Forum
a message clearly labelled as such, alleging that some
Move by some Player violates the principles expressed
in the Eka-Platonist Manifesto (see below).  As soon as
such a Writ is issued, 100 Marks, or the total number
of Marks in the Treasury of the Player who made the
Move in question, whichever is smaller, is transferred
from the Treasury of the Player who made the Move,
to the Treasury of the Cabal.  It is the responsibility
of the Exalted Master to detect and report this transfer.

<p><li>Any Player who is not in the Jurisdiction of the Cabal
who exhibits general agreement with the principles expressed
in the Manifesto thereby becomes an Ally of the Cabal.
If the Exalted Master issues a Writ of Non-Compliance
against any Move made by an Ally of the Cabal, that
Player immediately ceases to be an Ally.

<p><li>The Eka-Platonist Manifesto is:
<p>
WHEREAS Rule 101 is the highest-precedence Rule in
the Agora Ruleset, and
<p>
WHEREAS Rule 101 clearly states that all Players
abide by all Rules at all times, and
<p>
WHEREAS any putative Rule which is not obeyed
by all Players at all times is therefore not in
fact a Rule, and should not be in the Agora Ruleset,
<p>
THEREFORE in order to uphold Rule 101, the following
steps must be taken:
<p><ul>
<li> Firstly, to identify those Rules which admit of
non-retractable violation, and to enact those Rule
Changes necessary to reduce their number to zero,
<p>
<li> Secondly, to identify those Rules which admit of
retractable violation, and to similarly reduce their
number to zero,
<p>
<li> Thirdly, to cleanse the Ruleset of every hint that
violation of any Rule is actually possible,
<p>
<li> Finally, to bask in the warm glow of public admiration
at the completion of this noble project, secure in the
knowledge that the Ruleset is that much closer to
pure and diamond-like perfection.

<p><li>The following text has no legal force:
To aid the Cabal in the accomplishment of its goals, five
Extra Votes are transferred from the Bank to the Cabal's
Treasury at the end of each Nomic Week.  It is the
responsibility of the Exalted Master to detect and report
this transfer.

<p><li>The following text has no legal force:
Whenever the Compact of any Organization besides this one
requires or causes any transfer of Currency from any Treasury
that belongs neither to the Organization nor to any Player
within the Jurisdiction of the Organization, an identical
amount of the same Currency is immediately transferred from
the Treasury originally transferred to, to the Treasury of
the Secret Eka-Platonist Cabal.  It is the responsibility
of the Exalted Master to detect and report this transfer.
