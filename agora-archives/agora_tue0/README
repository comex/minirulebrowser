The file agora.mbox is an archive of the <agora@listserver.tue.nl> mailing
list, one of Agora's backup mailing lists.  The archive was supplied by
the Mailman software at <http://listserver.tue.nl/mailman/private/agora/>.
This file covers the period from the start of the archive up to the end
of 2006.

The tue.nl archive does not cover the list's entire history.  tue.nl
started hosting an Agora mailing list in 1997-08, but the archive only
goes back to 2003-08.  The archive is presumably complete for the period
from the first recorded message (2003-08-20).

Beware that dates in the "From " lines consistently give the wrong day
of the month.
