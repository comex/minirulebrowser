                              Quantum Report
			      ==============

===========================================================================
0. NEWS
===========================================================================

definitely-Promotor elJefe has published a pair of Proposals that
together will change the game state to what it would be if 2662
passed.

Steve, having accepted the Registrarship, is now definitely Registrar,
and has produced a definitely-legal Registrar's Report for us to VOC.

===========================================================================
1. PLAYERS
===========================================================================

Registrations of former Players are only maybe-successful at the moment
-- Rule 1043 referred to Game ends rather than months until Proposal
2697, on October 10th, and the passage of that Proposal is in question,
so registrations might still depend on Game ends (about which we know
precisely nothing).  Transitions On and Off Hold, and registrations of
new Players (or former Players continuously deregistered since before
the last Game end prior to September) are OK.

Of the Players believed to be currently registered, it turns out that
all are definitely registered currently, and no one else is
registered.

===========================================================================
2. OFFICIAL POSITIONS
===========================================================================

I think there are five critical offices whose identity needs to be
sorted out.  We have now collapsed the wave function sufficiently that
these Offices are all now held by known Players:

Office                  Holder
------                  ------
Assessor                Steve
Clerk of the Courts     Michael
Promotor                elJefe
Registrar               Steve
Rulekeepor              Chuck

===========================================================================
3. THE PROPOSALS
===========================================================================

definitely-Promotor elJefe has published a pair of Proposals that
together will fix most of the game state.  Proposal 2818 (AI=1) is a
VOC that will fix everything except the Ruleset, and Proposal 2819
(AI=3.1) will fix only the Ruleset.  I urge all Players to vote FOR
both of these Proposals.

As currency holdings are indeterminate, it is essential that no EVs are
cast on these Proposals, and that no one uses any Powers.  This
restriction does not apply to the other Proposals up for vote, as their
results are only of interest in the known game state.

===========================================================================
4. LATER STEPS
===========================================================================

definitely-Registrar Steve has produced a definitely-legal and
up-to-date Registrar's Report for the 2662-passed gamestate.  This was
posted to the Public Forum with the header "Date: Thu, 13 Feb 1997
15:48:41 +1100 (EST)".  To properly fix Officer identities (my PF
research turned up another irregularity, after the 2662 result),
someone will have to Propose a VOC of that Report (it's probably most
convenient for elJefe to do this).

After that VOC, with Officer identities fixed, we can pass a round of
regular VOCs on the Officers' next set of Reports.

===========================================================================

Your loyal wave function collapsor,

elJefe just resigned the Registrarship (which, by the way, he
definitely held in the gamestate where 2662 passed), and accepted the
Promotorship.  elJefe is now definitely Promotor.

Steve is definitely Assessor, and (once e accepts it) will be
definitely Registrar.  Chuck is definitely Rulekeepor, and Michael is
definitely CotC.

Office                  Intended holder
------                  ---------------
d50 29
a78 67
Assessor and Promotor are required for a working Proposal system.  CotC
and Rulekeepor are included because they are likely to be needed more
urgently than the other Offices.  Registrar is included because a
known-correct Registrar can produce a known-legal Registrar's Report,
which can be VOCed to fix the holders of all other Offices.

Taking into account the Special Quantum Report, the state of this at
the moment is:

. = might hold the Office
x = might hold the Office; resigned appropriately within the past week
X = definitely does not hold the position
O = is the intended holder

Note that for transfer of Office to be completely successful, the
intended holder must consent within seven days of the appointment.

===========================================================================
3. THE PLAN
===========================================================================

Swann has publically submitted a Proposal to create a high-precedence
Rule to conform the gamestate to what it would be if 2662 passed.
[Could someone please send me a copy of the Proposal, for inclusion in
future editions of this report?]

To fix the gamestate, we need first to pass Swann's Proposal, and then
to pass a regular VOC of a known-legal Registrar's Report.  Note that
the last thing posted as a Registrar's Report was definitely *not*
legal, or at least it wion't haven be after Swann's Proposal.  After
that VOC, with Officer identities fixed, we can pass a round of regular
VOCs on the Officers' next set of Reports.

Therefore: first, Steve, please consent to be Registrar, and produce an
up-to-date Report for the 2662-passed gamestate.  Then someone Propose
a VOC of that Report (it's probably most convenient for elJefe to do
this).  Then elJefe can distribute these two Proposals, as part of the
next batch.

It would be wise for all Votes on the relevant Proposals to be made in
the Public Forum.  As currency holdings are unknown, it is essential
that no EVs are cast on the Proposals, and that no one uses any
Powers.

When the Voting Period of the Proposal finishes, Steve can announce
results that will be known correct.  Assuming the Proposals are
adopted, this will ratify the Ruleset and Officer identities as we
believed them to be, with a high degree of certainty.

Please excuse this use of the Public Forum; I just want to be certain
this gets to all Players.  This report is an attempt to track what is
known about the `true' gamestate (the one in which Proposal 2662
failed), and codify the state of attempts to reach a fully known
gamestate.

Changes from the last report, in sections other than 0 and 4, are
marked by | marks in the right margin.

Progress continues towards the critical Offices being held correctly:

Officer identities seem in most cases to be reasonably resilient to
Schroedinger.  It seems to be impossible in the present case for anyone
to hold an Office without being aware of having held either that
Office, the Speakership or the Speaker-Electship at some point since
September.  Beyond that, though, there's significant uncertainty.

Proposal 2697, on October 10th, might possibly not have passed.  This
Proposal removed dependence on Game ends; in particular, it change
Speaker transitions from occurring at Game ends to every Quarter.  It
is therefore possible that some Speaker transitions since then have not
been legally effective.  Also, as Game ends are unknown, it is possible
that some Speaker transitions before that were not legal.  I think we
should treat all Players that we have believed to be Speaker since
September as being possibly Speaker at all times from when they first
appeared to become Speaker up to now.

which can be VOCed to fix the holders of all other Offices.  (Note that
the last report published as a Registrar's Report might not in fact be
an Official Document, if Steve was not Registrar.  Of course, a
roll-your-own MI=3.1 VOCish Rule will render it Official, making this
point moot.)

It seems that Officer identities are not *very* messed up, and I plan
to do some research with Vanyel's logs that will narrow down the
possibilities significantly.  Hoewever, being very paranoid, I think it
is wise to continue with elJefe's plan.  Everyone other than the
presumed holder of these Offices should resign them, appointing the
presumed holder as successor.  The state of this at the moment is:

intended holder must consent within seven days of the appointment;
Chuck, elJefe, Michael and Steve, please post consent to serve in your
respective Offices when everyone else has resigned them.

The first resignation attempts of Murphy and Swann were not entirely
successful, due to references to the "most recent Registrar's Report"
(which might not be what we think it is).  Vanyel's slightly different
formulation works, but I recommend that people use the following:

|If I am currently Assessor, I resign that Office, appointing Steve as
|my successor.
|
|If I am currently Clerk of the Courts, I resign that Office, appointing
|Michael as my successor.
|
|If I am currently Promotor, I resign that Office, appointing elJefe as
|my successor.
|
|If I am currently Registrar, I resign that Office, appointing Steve as
|my successor.
|
|If I am currently Rulekeepor, I resign that Office, appointing Chuck as
|my successor.
d130 1
a130 18
future editions of this report?]  Note that VOCs are very probably not
sufficient for the task at hand.

When elJefe is finally confirmed as being Promotor (and, please, not
before, ASAP notwithstanding), e can distribute Swann's Proposal.  It
would be wise for all Votes on this Proposal to be made in the Public
Forum only, particularly if Steve has not been confirmed to be Assessor
by that time.  As currency holdings are unknown, it is essential that
no EVs are cast on the Proposal, and that no one uses any Powers.

When Steve is confirmed as Assessor, and when the Voting Period of the
Proposal finishes, e can announce a result that will be known correct.
Assuming the Proposal is adopted, this will ratify the gamestate as we
believed it to be, with a high degree of certainty.

all are definitely registered currently.

It is possible that some Players were alleged to be Absent, and the
Absence confirmed by a maybe-Registrar.  Any such Players are currently
only maybe-registered.  If Scott went Absent, this is an issue; does
anyone recall exactly how e deregistered?  Coren went Absent while
Registrar; if eir deregistrartion was confirmed by a maybe-Speaker,
then e is only maybe-deregistered, and might still be Registrar.  As
the current identity of the Speaker is questionable, it would be
necessary for all Players that might be Speaker to confirm eir Absence
and then resign the Registrarship (again).  See the next section about
the Speaker.

Coren went Absent while e was Registrar.  Eir Absence had to be
confirmed by the Speaker.  It is possible that the person we thought
was Speaker was not.  I think it would be wise for all maybe-Speakers
to confirm eir Absence now, and then (again) resign the Registrarship,
which might have then been passed to them.

elJefe's research confirms that favor is indeed registered as a
Player.  The only remaining uncertainty in the Player list concerns
whether Absent Players have really been deregistered correctly.  See
the rewritten PLAYERS section for details.

The identity of the Speaker and Registrar are severely questionable.
See the OFFICIAL POSITIONS section for my recommendations.

elJefe has provided information confirming that Andre, Blob and Oerjan
are definitely registered as Players.  Only favor's status is still
uncertain.
d38 7
a44 6
Fortunately the Rules regarding registration and deregistration have
not changed radically since September.  However, anyone that
deregistered since September and subsequently reregistered might not
have legally reregistered, due to game end issues (Rule 1043 referred
to Game ends rather than months until Proposal 2697, on October 11th).
Player status is thus:
d46 2
a47 26
Player      Last change  Status
------      -----------  ------
Andre       Dec 17 1996  OK (was only On Hold)
Blob        Nov 12 1996  OK (had been deregistered for long enough)
Chuck       Jan 03 1996  OK (no change)
elJefe      Jan 25 1996  OK (no change)
favor       Jan 03 1997  ???
Harlequin   Jan 12 1997  OK (new Player)
KoJen       May 08 1996  OK (no change)
Macross     Feb 01 1997  OK (new Player)
Michael     Nov 02 1994  OK (no change)
Morendil    Jan 26 1996  OK (no change)
Murphy      Aug 23 1996  OK (no change)
Oerjan      Jan 09 1997  OK (was only On Hold)
Steve       Jul 16 1996  OK (no change)
Swann       Aug 05 1996  OK (no change)
Vanyel      Aug 22 1996  OK (no change)
Zefram      Jan 31 1996  OK (no change)

elJefe has opined that favor probably only went On Hold.  Until someone
is more certain, I'll still list him as unknown.

Registrations of former Players are only maybe-successful at the
moment.  Transitions On and Off Hold, and registrations of new Players
(or former Players continuously deregistered since before the last Game
end prior to September) are OK.
d51 38

only maybe-registered.  Archivist/Registrar/anyone, please check logs
for such an occurrence.  Once the identity of the Registrar has been
determined for certain, e can confirm Absences with certainty.  There
is an exception: Coren went Absent while e was Registrar; however, it
appears that the identity of the Speaker was known, so that Coren was
indeed deregistered properly.

The plan at this point, suggested by elJefe, is that everyone other
than the presumed holder of these Offices resign them, appointing the
presumed holder as successor.  The state of this at the moment is:

a195 6
Note: elJefe has argued fairly convincingly that the Offices are not
really as messed up as I imply above.  In particular, it seems that the
identity of the Registrar has been correctly known, and therefore all
Elections have been valid.  I recommend that we continue with the plan
above anyway, in order to be certain.
