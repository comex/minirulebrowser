(Apologies everyone, I've had a terrible week, and I didn't get in
this morning in enough time to post off my judgement.)

======================================================================
                               CFJ 875

"Rule 1006 should be interpreted to mean that if a Rule is enacted
 which designates a position to be an Office, and no procedure exists
 to determine which Player initially holds that Office, then such a 
 position is not an Office, unless such a Rule takes precedence over 
 Rule 1006."

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Relevant Rules : 1006, 1631

Basically, I agree with Steve that Rule 1006 defines an Office as a
position designated by such by the Rules and which is held by exactly
one Player.

Consequently, if another Rule states that a position which is held by
no Player is an Office, that Rule is in conflict with 1006 and such a
provision cannot apply unless such a Rule wins that conflict.
