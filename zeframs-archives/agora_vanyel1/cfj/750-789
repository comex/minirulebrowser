======================================================================

Statement:

"Speaker ElJefe violated Rule 452 by sending individual Vote Reminders to 
the Voters who had not yet voted on Proposals then up for Vote."

I Bar ElJefe from judging this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Clearly this act utilised the Speaker's knowledge of the standing of
the Votes. It's intent was to encourage players to vote, thereby
influencing the amount of Votes cast.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 452/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
No Electioneering by the Speaker

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal.

======================================================================

Judgment: TRUE

I Judge this statement to be TRUE.

If Rule 452 did not include the words "in an attempt," I would
judge this statement TRUE without reservation, since it is clear that
1) elJefe sent separate voting reminders out to Players who had not yet
voted, and 2) it is possible that these may have influenced the
vote.

But because Rule 452 *does* include the words "in an attempt," another
question is raised, namely, was elJefe *attempting* to influence
the vote?  Or would any such influence, if it occurred, have been
entirely unintentional?  It is impossible for me to know with
certainty elJefe's intent; but it seems very unlikely that such a
reminder could have been sent for any other purpose than encouraging
Players who had not yet voted to vote.  Thus, I still Judge TRUE,
but with somewhat more reluctance than I would have otherwise.

The Rules are not clear on how certain one must be of a TRUE or FALSE
Judgement to make it.  While I am not 100ertain that this statement
is TRUE, I am fairly certain.  There is certainly a case to be
made for UNDECIDED (or, if 1487 passes, UNKNOWN) on the basis that
no one but elJefe can know elJefe's intent with certainty, and
thus it cannot be known if elJefe attempted to influence the Vote.
I encourage elJefe to appeal this decision.  In fact, I hereby call
for appeal on the Judgement of CFJ 750.

[[Note of the CotC: Chuck's attempt to Call for Appeal is not binding,
as it was not posted to the Public Forum, at least not by himself.]]

======================================================================

Judgement of the pro-Speaker:  FALSE

Arguments:

Rule 452 states:
"The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
 vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
 Vote on that Proposal."

In order to establish the violation of Rule 452 the following
two questions must be answered with yes.

1) Did ElJefe attempt to influence the Voting Result by sending out
     individual voting reminders to Players which had not yet voted?

The result of a vote depends on two factors:
- the ratio of FOR and AGAINST votes
- the number of Players that voted

The only way that Speaker ElJefe can try to change a positive
F-A into a negative one (or vice versa) is by an approach of a
limited number of Players, namely those Players that are likely to
sway that result.

Judge TAL:
  when you sent out these infamous individual vote reminders,
  did you send this message to all Players who hadn't yet voted
  or only to a subset of those?

Suspect ElJefe:
  With regards to the individual voting reminders referred to in CFJ 750,
  I sent one to each player who had not voted.

Hence ElJefe did clearly not attempt to influence the F/A result.
On the other hand, it is also clear that sending a Voting Reminder to
each Player who had not voted is an attempt to change the number
of Players that voted.

Hence the answer on Question 1) is yes.

2) Did ElJefe use his knowledge of the status of the vote when he did so?

The fact that ElJefe's messages influenced the number of Voters,
only influences the result if Quorum on the Proposals had not yet
been reached. But that is not enough. We also ought to establish
that ElJefe *knew* that Quorum had not yet been reached.

Judge TAL:
  when you sent these messages, were there any Proposals for
  which Quorum had not yet been reached?

Suspect ElJefe:
  This was not in my mind at the time.  However, I recall that the Quorum
  was 10.  I don't remember exactly how many were sent, but I have a
  feeling that it was more than 10, which would mean that Quorum was
  not reached on the Proposals then up for vote.

Therefore, although ElJefe deduces today, that Quorum had not been
reached, he did not realise that when he send out his messages.

Hence, ElJefe did not use his knowledge of the Vote Status when
he attempted to influence the Vote.

Consequently, I judge NOT GUILTY, oops, FALSE.

Judgement of the Justiciar:  TRUE

I uphold Chuck's original Judgement and Judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Since the Statement implicitly ascribes certain motives to Eljefe in
acting as he did, I sought and obtained clarification from Eljefe as
to what his motives were. A copy of our communication is included below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Jeff,

Before I make my Judgement in the Appeal of CFJ 750, I would like 
confirmation from you personally that I have not misunderstood the
facts surrounding the case. Therefore I would like to put to you
that understanding and allow you to respond. Please feel free to
correct any errors or omissions, or add any comments. Please also
be aware that this communication may appear as evidence in my
Judgement.

The Statement alleges that you used your knowledge of the progress
of voting on a Proposal to influence the result on that Proposal,
by sending voting reminders specifically to Players whom you knew 
had not yet voted. As far as I am aware, you have not denied that
this is substantially the case. Is this in fact an accurate
description of what happened? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings, Steve.  I appreciate your courtesy in taking my evidence.

> The Statement alleges that you used your knowledge of the progress
> of voting on a Proposal to influence the result on that Proposal,
> by sending voting reminders specifically to Players whom you knew 
> had not yet voted. As far as I am aware, you have not denied that
> this is substantially the case. Is this in fact an accurate
> description of what happened? 

The facts in the above statement are correct, the only thing subject to
judgement or interpretation is the construction to be placed upon my
motives, as the Rule makes it illegal to use such knowledge in an "attempt"
to influence the result.

As I stated originally, I did use my knowledge of the vote, in order
to identify those who had not yet voted.  My intent was (at the time)
to encourage voter turnout, so that whatever result was returned would
be most likely the will of the Agorans.  I sent the individual reminders
to all and only those Voters who had not yet voted at the time.

I can see that Chuck decided that the only reason for doing this was an
"attempt to influence the result of the voting", but he didn't give any
reasoning or evidence for this conclusion, and that wasn't the way I saw 
it at the time.

It is possible, however, that I was wrong.  Certainly it would have been
more prudent to send individual reminders to everyone.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Eljefe admits that he did use his knowledge of the vote in order to
identify those who had not yet voted; he then sent reminders to those
Players in attempt to get them to vote. Since if this attempt were
successful then the result of the vote would be altered, and since
Eljefe knew this to be the case, I am satisfied that in acting as he
did, Eljefe did use his knowledge of the vote in an attempt to
influence the result of the vote, and hence that his action was a
violation of Rule 452 within the strict meaning of that Rule.
However, I do want to emphasize that I don't think that Eljefe is
guilty of anything more than a minor misdemeanour, and that it was
clearly committed in good faith and with good intentions.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Clerk of the Courts:  UNKNOWN

I Judge this CFJ to be UNKNOWN.  I am taking the liberty of
referencing the evidence TAL obtained (which appears in his Judgement,
already submitted to the Court) by questioning elJefe directly about
the circumstances surrounding the events in question.  Unlike TAL,
however, I feel that the evidence available to me, as a Judge, is
insufficient to provide compelling proof for a finding of either TRUE
or FALSE, and I further believe that there is no way that sufficient
evidence can be obtained that would compel a Judgement of either TRUE
or FALSE.  Clearly the Statement is not such that it engenders a
paradox, so a finding of UNDECIDABLE is not permitted, by Rule 591/2.
My only remaining legal Judgement is therefore UNKNOWN, and I enter my
finding as such.

======================================================================

Statement:

"Rule 1438 can only be interpretated in such a way, that no Rule
can lead to a Punitive Point Loss"

Players barred: Swann, Vanyel, Chuck

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Note: if Judged TRUE the Judge has the right to issue an Injonction,
to annotate Rule 1438.

Rule 1438 defines a Punitive Point Loss (PPL) in a negative way:
"Punitive Point Losses are those losses *not* due to:, etc."

One of the excluded losses is
" vii) Rules that also adjust the number of Blots a Player has."

Now suppose that a Rule X imposes a point loss on a Player and that
such a loss is not already covered by one of the other exceptions.

By 1438 that Player will then
"...receive Blots equal to half the number of Points lost, rounded
down."

Hence Rule X will in that case lead to an adjustment in the number of
Points a Player has.

But in that case Rule X falls under the exclusion clause vii) quoted above.
Consequently, that loss can not be a PPL.

Quod Erat Demonstrandum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 1438/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots Due to a Punititve Point Loss

      A Punitive Point Loss is a point loss that results in gaining
      Blots.

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Punitive Point loss, the Player
      losing Points will receive Blots equal to half the number of
      Points lost, rounded down.

      Punitive Point Losses are those losses *not* due to:

         i) Voluntary transfers of Points to any other Player or any
            other Nomic Entity.
        ii) Voluntary destruction of a Player's own Points.
       iii) The outcome of a Vote on a Proposal
        iv) Adjustments made as part of a correction in the Game
            State.
         v) The reset of scores due to the end of a Game.
        vi) A score change that a Rule specifically designates as
            Non-Punitive.
       vii) Rules that also adjust the number of Blots a Player has.

      Further, a Point Loss ceases to be Punitive when the Rule
      mandating the Loss is amended to explicitly state either of the
      following:

         i) The Rule does not impose a Blot penalty.
        ii) The Rule does impose a Blot penalty, the amount of the
            Blot penalty, and the Player responsible for reporting
            those Blots to the Tabulator.

      Players Legally Responsible for reporting Punitive Point losses
      to the Scorekeepor also have the Legal Responsibility to report
      Blots due to those Punitive Point losses to the Tabulator.

      This Rule shall remain in effect until there are no longer any
      Punitive Point Losses defined in the Ruleset, at which point
      this Rule will repeal itself.

History:
Created by Proposal 1459, Mar. 1 1995

======================================================================

Judgment: FALSE

TAL makes a simple mistake in his argument, by neglecting to note
the force of the word "also" in clause (vii) in Rule 1438. This
clause states that "Punitive Point Losses are those losses *not*
due to ... (vii) Rules which *also* adjust the number of Blots a
Player has."

TAL's argument is that Rule 1438 itself falls under this description.
But this is not so; while Rule 1438 does adjust the Blots of Players,
it does not itself authorize any Punitive Point Losses. Hence it
it is not a Rule of the type specified in clause (vii).

Statement:

"Rule 911 should be interpreted such that CFJ 750 has been

Relevant Rules: 911, 478, 591, 408

Injunction: I do not request an Injunction with this CFJ.  However,
Rule 789 still requires me to provide a list of Relevant Rules; and
if the Judge Judges TRUE, e is permitted to issue an Injunction in
accordance with Rule 789.

I bar Kelly from Judging this statement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Rule 911 states that a Judgement is appealed upon the insistence
of three Players to the Public Forum.  Coren and TAL have posted
their calls for appeal directly to nomic-business, which constitutes
the Public Forum.  (I can find no explicit evidence that Distributor
Coren has defined nomic-business as the Public Forum; however, the
info message with nomic-business states that all Players are required
to be subscribed to it, which I take as definition as the Public
Forum.  The same applies to nomic-offical.)

It is the third Player's "insistence"--mine--which is primarily
under dispute.  I included it in my Reasons and Arguments on my Judgement
of CFJ 750 which was not posted directly by me to the Public Forum; it was
sent to COTC Kelly.  Kelly then posted it to (and was required to post
it to) the Public Forum.  (She is required to send it to all Players,
by Rules 408 and 591; by Rule 478, this constitutes the Public Forum.)

Does this indirect posting to the Public Forum, by me through Kelly,
constitute "insistence to the Public Forum?"  I believe it does.
There is nothing in the Rules to suggest the path something takes
to the defined lists affects whether or not it is posted to the
Public Forum.  Some mail messages may go through several nodes
before reaching teleport.com, but no one would suggest that
they are not posted to the Public Forum because they did not go
to teleport.com first.  Similarly, my insistence was sent to
the Public Forum, only through the COTC.

I also believe Game Custom supports me on this.  There was a time
when the Distributor list was handled manually.  Yet no one suggested
that something was not sent to the Public Forum because it was sent
to the Distributor first.  (And note the Distributor Rule only provides
an exception when something is to be sent to all Players, not when
something is to be sent to the Public Forum.)

======1.  Rule 911

Rule 911/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall forfeit the
      compensation e received for judging.

The Public Forum

      The Public Forum is any medium defined by the Distributor as

      Forum, then a message send to all Active Players fulfills this
      requirement as well"

=====3.  Rule 591

Rule 591/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Legal Judgements

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED. The
      Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
      include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

Rule 408/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and the CotC randomly selects another Judge from among eligible
      Players.  A Judgement is delivered by submitting that Judgement
      to the Clerk of the Courts, who must then distribute that
      Judgement to all Players as soon as possible.

Rule 796/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Distributor

      There shall be an Office known as the Distributor. Whenever the
      Rules state that anything must be sent to all Players, they
      may instead be sent to the Distributor with some indication
      that they should be forwarded to all Players. The Distributor
      shall then send this message to all Players as soon as possible
      and in the order recieved. The first  Distributor shall be Wes.
      This Rule shall take precedence over all Rules which require a
      Player to send something to all Players.

  --> Chuck receives 3 Points

======================================================================

Statement:

"Speaker ElJefe violated Rule 452 by sending individual Vote Reminders to
the Voters who had not yet voted on Proposals then up for Vote."

I Bar ElJefe from judging this.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Clearly this act utilised the Speaker's knowledge of the standing of
the Votes. It's intent was to encourage players to vote, thereby
influencing the amount of Votes cast.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 452/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
No Electioneering by the Speaker

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal.

======================================================================

Judgment: TRUE

I Judge this statement to be TRUE.

If Rule 452 did not include the words "in an attempt," I would
judge this statement TRUE without reservation, since it is clear that
1) elJefe sent separate voting reminders out to Players who had not yet
voted, and 2) it is possible that these may have influenced the
vote.

But because Rule 452 *does* include the words "in an attempt," another
question is raised, namely, was elJefe *attempting* to influence
the vote?  Or would any such influence, if it occurred, have been
entirely unintentional?  It is impossible for me to know with
certainty elJefe's intent; but it seems very unlikely that such a
reminder could have been sent for any other purpose than encouraging
Players who had not yet voted to vote.  Thus, I still Judge TRUE,
but with somewhat more reluctance than I would have otherwise.

The Rules are not clear on how certain one must be of a TRUE or FALSE
Judgement to make it.  While I am not 100ertain that this statement
is TRUE, I am fairly certain.  There is certainly a case to be
made for UNDECIDED (or, if 1487 passes, UNKNOWN) on the basis that
no one but elJefe can know elJefe's intent with certainty, and
thus it cannot be known if elJefe attempted to influence the Vote.
I encourage elJefe to appeal this decision.  In fact, I hereby call
for appeal on the Judgement of CFJ 750.

[[Note of the CotC: Chuck's attempt to Call for Appeal is not binding,
as it was not posted to the Public Forum, at least not by himself.]]

This is getting interesting, and needs to be resolved...

Please accept my Appeal of CFJ 750.

I don't have real strong feelings one way or the other, but I'd like to
see both whether elJefe actually is at fault, *and* whether Chuck, by
sending his Appeal as part of a message he knew with full certainty would 
be posted to the Public Forum, actually did so.

======================================================================

Judgment: FALSE

Relevant Rules: 911, 478, 591, 408, 910, 991, 662, 789


Arguments:

In order to determine the question at hand we must define exactly what 
Rule 911/1 requires before a CFJ is Appealed.  The relevant sentence is:

     "A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum."

For the moment I'll ignore the phrase "A Judgement may be Appealed."  
I'll get back to it at the end of my statement.

First, it needs to be settled what the phrase "insistence of any three 
Players to the Public Forum" actually means.

Now, it is true that the grammar of this sentence could be interpreted 
so that the phrase "to the Public Forum" is referring to "Appealed."  
This interpretation means that there are no explicit strictures, or even 
definition, of a Player's "insistence."

I think, however, that Game Custom supports interpreting this phrase to 
refer to the "Player's insistence."  Also, Game Custom also supports 
interpreting "Player's insistence" as a message explicitly calling for 
an Appeal.

So it is this Judge's opinion that the phrase:
   "insistence of any three Players to the Public Forum"
When filtered through the lens of Game Custom, means:
   "three messages in the Public Forum, from three different Players, 
    calling for an Appeal."

I quote from Chuck's Arguments:

     "[...] Coren and TAL have posted their calls for appeal directly to 
      nomic-business, which constitutes the Public Forum.  (I can find 
      no explicit evidence that Distributor Coren has defined nomic-
      business as the Public Forum; however, the info message with 
      nomic-business states that all Players are required to be 
      subscribed to it, which I take as definition as the Public Forum.  
      The same applies to nomic-offical.)"

This is a valid appeal to Game Custom, which is that nomic-business and
nomic-official are currently the Public Forum when no other definition 
exists.  However, even if Distributor had no such Public Forum defined 
when this question occurred, Rule 478/1  states:

     "If a Rule requires that a message is send to the Public
      Forum, then a message send to all Active Players fulfills this
      requirement as well."

Since nomic-business is required to be subscribed to by all Players, it 
is the Public Forum outside any statement by the Distributor, or at 
least as long as the Distributor does not specifically exclude it as 
such.  [At this point the Judge would like to call attention to a tense 
error in 478/1, "send" should be "sent."]

It is therefore clear that Coren and TAL, by posting directly to nomic-
business, fulfilled the requirements (such as they are) of 911/1.  The 
messages from Coren and TAL consist of two valid "insistences."

What remains is Chuck's own "insistence."

Again, I quote from Chuck's arguments:

     "[...] I included [my insistence] in my Reasons and Arguments on my 
      Judgement of CFJ 750 which was not posted directly by me to the 
      Public Forum; it was sent to COTC Kelly.  Kelly then posted it to 
      [...] the Public Forum.  (She is required to send it to all 
      Players, by Rules 408  and 591 ; by Rule 478, this constitutes the 
      Public Forum.)"

It is clear, even without recourse to Common Sense, that Chuck has a 
very valid point here.  The re-formulated version of Rule 478, as quoted 
above, defines *any* message sent [send] to "all Active Players" as the
"Public Forum."

Chuck:

     "I included [my insistence] in my Reasons and Arguments on my
      Judgement of CFJ 750"

Rule 408/1:

     "A Judgement is delivered by submitting that Judgement
      to the Clerk of the Courts, who must then distribute that
      Judgement to all Players as soon as possible."

Rule 591/1:

     "Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement."

It is obvious that,  because the CotC is required by the rules to send a 
Judgement to "all Players," and that Judgement must also be accompanied 
by the "reasons and arguments," then any message included in the 
"reasons and arguments" is being sent to the "Public Forum" as defined 
by 478/1.  Therefore Chuck has sent a valid "insistence," fulfilling the 
three insistence requirement of rule 911/1.

Which brings us back to the question at hand:

     "Rule 911 should be interpreted such that CFJ 750 has been
      successfully appealed."

There is a problem here, and that problem is the phrase "successfully 
appealed."

Specifically, was it legal for Kelly, as the CotC, to refuse to accept 
Chuck's insistence, even if it *was* properly made to the Public Forum?
I quote Kelly's message of Sun, 12 Mar 95 02:34:51 EST5:

     "i continue to hold that your privately-expressed insistence upon
      appeal is not binding upon me."

If it is legal for Kelly to do this, then the Appeal would certainly not 
be "successful."

If the question had been:

     "Rule 911 should be interpreted such that CFJ 750 has been 
      appealed."

I would have no problem, relying on Game Custom, in judging this CFJ as 
TRUE.

However, Chuck's introduction of 911's language into the question forces 
me to consider what the phrase "successfully appealed" actually means. 
The rub is in the phase I alluded to earlier, "A Judgement may be 
Appealed upon..."  It doesn't say a "A Judgement will be Appealed by..." 
or "A Judgement must be Appealed by..." or even, "A Judgement is 
Appealed in the following manner..."

In fact, the phrasing of that first sentence, "A Judgement may be 
Appealed upon the insistence of any three Players to the Public Forum,"
even when filtered through Game Custom and Common Sense, does not-- I 
repeat, does *not*-- imply that three insistences are a necessary and 
sufficient condition for a CFJ to be Appealed.

The word "may" says that the CFJ also "may *not*" be appealed.  Three 
insistences to the Public Forum only allows this decision to be made.  
The fact that this decision has always been in the affirmative 
beforehand does not change the language of the Rule.

Worse, the word "upon" implies that it is not the three insisting 
Players who are doing the Appealing!

It is clear that, once three insistences are made, a further step-- 
beyond the three insistences-- must be taken for an CFJ to be 
successfully Appealed.  Following 911/1 language to decipher what is 
happening leads me to the following conclusions:

   1) Three insistences to the Public Forum allow, but does not require,
      a CFJ to be Appealed.

   2) Some Entity that is not the three insisting Players has the power 
      to Appeal the CFJ.

   3) This Entity has the power to Appeal or not Appeal, as it chooses, 
      since 911/1 does not specifically bind it to do so.

So, who or what, is this Entity?  911/1 does not help much, since after 
this troublesome sentence it goes directly into what happens once a CFJ 
is "successfully Appealed."  Neither is 910/1, which defines the duties 
of Justices and has little bearing on making Appeals.

Which leaves us with Common Sense.  Which, I believe, suggests that this 
Entity is, in fact, the Clerk of the Courts.  It is the CotC who accepts 
CFJ's (Rule 991/0) and determines if a CFJ is accepted for Judgement 
(Rule 662/0.) It therefore follows, if a power exists to decide if an 
Appeal is "successful" or not, and whether the Appeal is made or not, it 
resides with the CotC.

It is therefore the opinion of this Judge that CotC Kelly did in fact 
have the legal power to deny Chuck's insistence, *even if* such an 
insistence was made to the Public Forum.  Therefore I  have no choice 
but to rule FALSE on CFJ 752. Since CotC Kelly has refused to Appeal CFJ 
750, and has the power to do so arbitrarily via Rule 911/1, CFJ 750 has 
*not* been successfully Appealed, even though, in this Judge's opinion, 
three Players have made insistences to the Public Forum as otherwise 
required by Rule 911/1.

Injunction:

Since I am ruling this CFJ FALSE, I cannot via Rule 789/1 issue an 
Injunction to annotate 911/1.  This is truly unfortunate, in that this 
is a rather important interpretation of the CotC's power.  I therefore 
make a non-binding request to the Rulekeepor to add an unofficial 
comment to Rule 911 stating that the CotC has the power to reject 
Appeals.

911 states that "A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of
any three Players to the Public Forum."  i do not see how a third
party can convey the insistence of another player to the Public Forum.

i believe this is disanalogous to the situation with point transfers;
in that case the transfer is what needs to be posted.  in this case,
the player must express eir insistence to the public forum.  i contend
that another player cannot act as an intermediate vehicle of such
expression.  your insistence of appeal was made not to the public
forum, but to me, personally.

i continue to hold that your privately-expressed insistence upon
appeal is not binding upon me.  feel free to CFJ on the matter.

as an aside, i think this phrasing in 911/1 is perfectly terrible.

Rule 910/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appeals and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office 
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

[In CFJ 728 Judge Vlad opined that Rules 910/0 and 897/0 jointly
imply that a Player Barred from Judging a certain CFJ is also
forbidden from serving as Justice on an Appeal of that CFJ.]

Rule 991/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Invoking Judgement

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      No Player shall submit more than five CFJ's per week.
      (*Was: 407*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 662/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Allowed CFJ's

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

----------------------------------------

Rule 789/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Amended(1) by Proposal 1396, Jan. 29 1995
----------------------------------------

======================================================================

Judgement of the Justiciar:  FALSE

I uphold Swann's original Judgement that the Statement is FALSE.

Swann's quite remarkable Judgement discovers in the language of
Rule 911 a previously unsuspected power of the CotC to arbitrarily
refuse to accept Appeals, even if these are made to the Public
Forum. Perhaps this discovery outrages the sensibilities of those
to whom it seems clear that Rule 911 was never intended to grant
the CotC such a power. That is not my concern. It is my task to
determine if Swann's Judgement was correct in law. In my view,
Judge Swann was perfectly within his rights to read Rule 911 as
closely as he did, and to deduce from the language contained
therein his surprising conclusion. In the absence of an overriding
reason to overturn his Judgement, I therefore uphold his Judgement
that the Statement of CFJ 752 is FALSE.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Speaker:  FALSE

Swann's judgement of FALSE turns on the question of interpreting Rule 911,
in particular the first sentence "A Judgement may be Appealed upon the 
insistence of any three Players to the Public Forum."

After much discussion, he finds that Chuck's indirectly communicated 
insistence counts as "insistence to the Public Forum", but denies that
the sentence actually mandates an Appeal.

The wording is "may be Appealed upon", not "is Appealed upon" or "may be 
Appealed by".  The first alternative phrasing would effect a legal event 
("Appeal"), whereas the second alternative phrasing is a definition of how 
to effect the event; there really is no difference between them.  

Unfortunately and strangely, the actual language leaves the word "Appeal" 
adrift, with neither a mandate for when it occurs nor a definition of how 
to carry it out.

Therefore I uphold the judgement of FALSE.

======================================================================

Judgment of the Delegate for the Clerk of the Courts: UNDECIDED

Arguments:

1) Is Chuck's attempt to post an appeal to the Public Forum, with the
CotC as intermediary, a valid posting to the Forum?

I think the answer is yes.
911/1 requires that the Appeal message is send to the Public Forum.
Rule 478/1 defines the Public Forum as:
"The Public Forum is any medium defined by the Distributor as such."

Obviously the CotC is not such a medium :-)

However, the Rule continues:
"If a Rule requires that a message is send to the Public
 Forum, then a message send to all Active Players fulfills this
 requirement as well."

And this of course is exactly what Chuck did. The fact that the
CotC was used as intermediary is irrelevant, because Chuck's appeal
was inbedded in the Arguments to a Judgment and he know that the
CotC was obliged to forward that message to all Active Players.

Note that a few days earlier 478 had been amended.
478/0 put a time limit on the forwarding to all Players, which is no
longer the case in 478/1.

2) Were there three Players insisting on the Appeal of CFJ 750?

The answer is yes again. I established in 1) that Chuck did so,
by indirect means. Coren and TAL on the other hand posted directly
to nomic-discussion, which makes three Players in total.

3) Is three Players insisting on the Appeal of CFJ 750 a sufficient
condition?

Although Judge Swann made an argument to the contrary, I tend to
think the answer here is `yes' too. However, we are close to the limits
of my knowledge of English (and maybe outside :-)

Swann's argument may be summarized as follows:
   911 says: "A Judgement may be Appealed ...."
   The word "may" implies that the three insistences to the Public Forum
   only allows the decision of the Appeal to take place to be made.

911 uses `Appeal' in its verbal form.
Well, `to appeal' means:
  1: to take steps to have (a case) reheard in a higher court
  2: to plead for help, corroboration, or decision
  3: to arouse a sympathetic response

Therefore the very act of `requesting a Judgment to be overturned'
is equivalent to `Appealing'. And in Nomic that *may* be done by
posting to the Public Forum. As shown in 1) and 2) three Players
did so. Successfully, I might add: their messages made it to all
Players.

However, this dictionary definition of `appeal' combined with the
'upon' makes it for me impossible to parse the whole sentence,
in a way it makes sense. I therefore will assume here that Swann
is right.

4) Did CotC Kelly have the *legal* power to deny Chuck's insistence?

According to Judge Swann, Common Sense [sic] dictates that the entity
who takes the decision whether a Judgment is successfully appealed
can only be the CotC. Swann arrives at this conclusion by pointing
out the analogy with the CotC's power of decision in accepting CFJ's
for Judgment (Rule 662).

However, 911/1 claims: "If a Judgement is successfully Appealed,
the Justices shall each  Judge the Statement as if they were Judges."

Without appealing to Common Sense I conclude that the CotC -who
after all is a Justice- has the legal power to deny an insistence
to appeal, because e shall Judge the Statement *only* if a Judgment
is successfully Appealed.

However, e may only do so, when this is legally justified and I
established in 1) and 2) that this is not the case with respect to
Chuck's appeal. Therefore, if *I* would have been Justice on CFJ 750
then I would have had no choice as to consider the Appeal.

But, as Justice Steve points out bi-monthly, justice is for a
large part interpretation and Justice Kelly apparently interprets
Rule 478 differently, then I do.

In fact, it might just be possible that Justice Kelly comes to one
conclusion, while Justice Steve and Justice ElJefe arrive at
another. At the time this CFJ was made we had not yet heard the
opinion of the other two Justices on the matter!

5) Should Rule 911 be interpreted such that CFJ 750 has been
successfully appealed?

I summarize:
- In my opinion, Chuck's appeal was legal, and so where Coren's and TAL's.
- However, a Justice may refuse to take note of appeals if they
are not legally made, in eir opinion.
- At the time CFJ 752 was made we had not heard yet of the other
two Justices.

Whereas Rule 451 obliges me to base my evaluation on the
`truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was issued',
and whereas two out of three Justices had not yet given their
opinion on whether Chuck's indirect posting constituted a legal
means of Appealing, I feel I have only the right to judge UNDECIDED.

Note: I think 911 is not too bad. Apparently the three Justices may not
only reJudge the CFJ if there is an Appeal, they may also "judge" whether
there was an Appeal in the first place. That seems more logical to me
then leaving it in the hands of one Officer only.

Rule 911/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall forfeit the
      compensation e received for judging.

Now consider 1479. A Player is rewarded for voting ABSTAIN even if
he/she would otherwise have voted FOR or AGAINST. Often failing to
do so will result in a loss of political power relative to the other
Players. This seems like coercion to me.

References:

Rule 1003/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed.  Such a
      proposal is considered not to be "proposed in the proper way".

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.
      (*Was: 822*)

[relevant text of Proposal 1479]

An Extra Vote is created for a Player whenever that Player casts
      a vote of ABSTAIN on any Proposal, and that Player does not already
      possess 5 Extra Votes. However, the Player does not receive the
      Extra Vote created for em by the casting of a vote of ABSTAIN on
      a Proposal until the results of the voting on that Proposal are
      published. An Extra Vote is destroyed whenever the Player who
      possesses it uses it to cast a Vote on a Proposal.

======================================================================

Judgment:  FALSE.

Reason: The direct intent of Proposal 1479 is to create a Rule;
It is only the intent of the Rule (thus indirectly of the Proposal)
to coerce us to vote ABSTAIN.

Concurring Opinion (authored by Steve; joined by Michael and elJefe)

Oerjan is of course correct to Judge the CFJ FALSE, but I feel constrained
to dissent from his use of the word "coerce". I maintain that the intent,
direct or otherwise, of Rule 1442, is not to coerce any Player to vote
in any way, but rather to offer Players a different way of thinking about
voting. Coercion is the use of force to compel action, and it different
from the application of subtle pressures. No Player is being compelled
by Rule 1442 to abstain on any proposals. They are being asked to consider
the advantages that might accrue from abstaining on some proposals.
There's a big difference.

Statement:

"Rule 1442/0 must be interpreted such that, provided a player does not
already possess 5 Extra Votes, that player can gain Extra Votes up to
the number of proposals voted on in a single vote message sent to the
Speaker, by voting ABSTAIN on any or all of them."

I bar elJefe from Judging this statement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

If the voting player does not have 5 EVs at the time of a message to the
Speaker containing more than one vote, then it is certainly the case
that for any single vote contained in that message that the player does
not have 5 EVs at the time of the casting of that vote.  Thus any vote
of ABSTAIN does satisfy the criterion for creation of an EV for that
player, and that player will receive that EV when the results of the
voting on that Proposal are published.  QED.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 1442/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Extra Votes

      There is a Currency called Extra Votes. The Recordkeepor for
      this Currency is the Speaker.  Possession of an Extra Vote
      entitles a Player to cast an extra Vote on a Proposal of eir
      choice. Extra Votes may be traded between Players, but they may
      not be owned by Groups.

      An Extra Vote is created for a Player whenever that Player casts 
      a vote of ABSTAIN on any Proposal, and that Player does not
      already possess 5 Extra Votes. However, the Player does not
      receive the Extra Vote created for em by the casting of a vote
      of ABSTAIN on a Proposal until the results of the voting on that
      Proposal are published. An Extra Vote is destroyed whenever the
      Player who possesses it uses it to cast a Vote on a Proposal.

      Provided that they possess at least one Extra Vote, Players
      may use a maximum of one Extra Vote per proposal to cast an
      extra Vote on that Proposal. Extra Votes are cast in the same
      manner as Votes, as described in other Rules.


======================================================================

Judgment: FALSE

Arguments: It is unfortunate that JonRock phrased his CFJ the
way he did, because I think his general argument is sound. 
The problem is that a "single vote message" may contain votes
on two batches of proposals distributed at different times. A
perfect example would be the last two batches, which I voted on in a 
single message. The first batch's Voting Period will end first, 
possibly creating Extra Votes which would prevent the gaining of
EV's from ABSTAIN Votes in the second batch. Thus JonRock's statement
does not hold in all cases.

Vlad

======================================================================

Judgement of the Justiciar:  TRUE

I overturn Judge Vlad's ruling and Judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Vlad's argument misreads JonRock's Statement. Given the wording of that
Statement, the issue is not whether there is any possible case where
a Player *cannot* gain EVs as JonRock suggests, but whether there is
any possible case where e *can* gain them. The point is, as JonRock
says and I feel sure the other Justices will agree, that EVs under
Rule 1442/0 are created at the time of voting, but not distributed
until the the time of publication. Hence, a Player like Michael, who
did as a matter of fact abstain on all 35 of the Proposals 1499-1533,
does in fact receive 35 EVs, since at the time he voted he did not
possess any EVs at all.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Clerk of the Courts:  TRUE

I judge this CFJ to be TRUE, overturning Vlad's original decision.

Rule 1442/0 is clear in the matter of the timing of the creation and
awarding of Extra Votes.  The Vote is created when the Vote is Cast,
and it is Game Custom that a Vote is Cast at the moment the Vote is
received by the Speaker.  However, the Extra Vote thus created is not
given to the Player until the results are published, so a Player might
have any number of Extra Votes in "abeyance" during the period between
the moment e casts a Vote of ABSTAIN and the end of the Voting Period
of that Proposal.  These Votes are _not_ in the possession of the
Voter (it is unclear exactly what Nomic Entity _is_ in possession of
them, but I do not believe that this issue is of importance here).
Therefore, the simple act of casting a Vote of ABSTAIN does _not_
immediately increase a Player's holding of Extra Votes, and therefore
a Player is not limited in the number of such "virtual" Extra Votes e
might accrue (as long as e does not have 5 or more actual Extra
Votes).

As an aside, I do not see how Judge Vlad's argument applies in any way
whatsoever.  As long as the vote is cast prior to the receipt of any
Extra Votes which would cause the Player to have 4 or more actual
Extra Votes, the Player does accrue the Virtual Extra Votes to which e
is entitled, even if e does vote upon Proposals with differing Voting
Periods in a single message.

Kelly Martin
Clerk of the Courts

======================================================================

Judgement of the pro-Speaker: FALSE

Arguments:

It seems that it all comes down to the word `possess'. Can the Player
for whom the Extra Vote is created when e casts eir vote, be
considered to *possess* that Extra Vote as soon as the time of its
creation?

This delegate-Justice, not particularly known for his fluency in
English, is of the opinion that the answer is yes.

It is certain that the Extra Vote created, exists between the time
the Player casts eir Vote and the time the Voting Results are
published. If it is not the Player who owns this newly created
Extra Vote, who does?

The Extra Vote is a Currency and according to Rule 611
`No non-player Nomic entity may own Currencies except as provided for
in the Rules.' As the Rules are silent, I may exclude any other
Nomic Entity as temporary possessor of the Extra Vote.

Nevertheless, between the time of it's creation and the time of
publication of the Voting Results the Recordkeepor of the EV is
obliged to keep track of it, that is, attribute it to somebody?

Logically, it is the Player which casted the Extra Vote, who possesses
it.


References:

Rule 611/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Currencies: Who May Own Currencies

      Players may own any type of Currency.  No non-player Nomic
      entity may own Currencies except as provided for in the Rules.
      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or
      other Nomic entity must be non-negative, and must be an integer.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to
      rules for specific Currencies.

Rule 1442/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Extra Votes

      There is a Currency called Extra Votes. The Recordkeepor for
      this Currency is the Speaker.  Possession of an Extra Vote
      entitles a Player to cast an extra Vote on a Proposal of eir
      choice. Extra Votes may be traded between Players, but they may
      not be owned by Groups.

      An Extra Vote is created for a Player whenever that Player casts
      a vote of ABSTAIN on any Proposal, and that Player does not
      already possess 5 Extra Votes. However, the Player does not
      receive the Extra Vote created for em by the casting of a vote
      of ABSTAIN on a Proposal until the results of the voting on that
      Proposal are published. An Extra Vote is destroyed whenever the
      Player who possesses it uses it to cast a Vote on a Proposal.

      Provided that they possess at least one Extra Vote, Players
      may use a maximum of one Extra Vote per proposal to cast an
      extra Vote on that Proposal. Extra Votes are cast in the same
      manner as Votes, as described in other Rules.

Statement:

"Rule 1003/0 should be interpreted to disallow Proposals that create
Rules that include, or amend Rules to include, sanctions that penalize
players for the way they vote on the Proposal adopting the Rule change
in question."

Relevant Rules: 1003/0

Injunction: If Judged TRUE, Rule 1003/0 should be annotated as allowed
by Rule 789/1.

I bar Kelly and Michael from Judging this statement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Kelly has made an argument that in the situation I've stated, it is
the *Rule* not the *Proposal* that is doing the coercion.  I maintain,
as does Michael, that the threat of force-- say proposing a rule with
the clause, "All Players who did not vote For this rule immediately lose
100 Points upon its adoption."-- is in itself coercive, even if it is
the Rule itself that is doing the penalizing.

In the example above, even though it is the Rule that takes the 100
Points from the Player, I maintain that it is the "obvious and direct
intent" of including such a clause in a proposal to "coerce a Player
into voting against eir conscience."  Note, it says "a" Player not
"all" Players.  If *any* Player is changing eir vote based on such a
clause, e is being coerced.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 1003/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed.  Such a
      proposal is considered not to be "proposed in the proper way".

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.
      (*Was: 822*)

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

It is clear to me that the obvious and direct intent of any Proposal is
to allow the occurrence of any actions and game moves which would occur
according to the Rules during the voting period of that Proposal, and
upon the adoption of that Proposal, by satisfying a major requirement
for such actions and game moves to occur.  Thus, that obvious and direct
intent is both a promise and a threat that such actions and game moves
WILL occur, after the remaining requirements have been satisfied (i.e.,
publication and/or adoption).  If a Proposal would create a Rule(s), or
amend a Rule(s), to cause immediate penalties to individual players
based on their voting on that Proposal, then the obvious and direct
intent of the Proposal does include the threat to recognize those
penalties, in addition to the Proposal's other effects.  This threat to
penalize based on voting is coercion to vote against conscience.

The above reasoning is sufficient to rule on the statement of the CFJ,
but other points are noteworthy:

o Kelly's argument fails in that the Rule is not doing the coercing; the
  Rule is doing the actual penalizing.  The Proposal, carrying the
  implicit threat to penalize, is what is coercive.

o The threatened penalty may include, but is not limited to, (a)
  unconsented loss of any Currency or Points, whether or not
  remuneration in another form is provided for by the same Proposal, or
  (b) unconsented loss of any ability to perform actions within the
  game, including loss of any ability to submit Proposals and loss of
  any freedom of vote choice on any future Proposal.  (The utility of
  any of these possessions and rights, to the Player possessing them,
  cannot be judged by anyone else and must be regarded as maximal.  In
  addition, Rule 783/0 also prohibits some of these penalties.)

o Coercion to vote against conscience is NOT present if the penalty
  imposed by the adoption of a Proposal (i.e., threatened by the
  Proposal itself) is not based on the vote of the Player to be
  penalized.  In this case, the Player clearly does have the freedom to
  vote with eir conscience (i.e., AGAINST the Proposal to impose the
  penalty).

o Coercion to vote against conscience is still present if the Rule
  imposing the penalty based on voting is not the Rule created or
  amended by the Proposal, as it is still an unconsented penalty
  threatened by the Proposal and recognized upon adoption of the
  Proposal.  This is in contrast to Rule 783/0, which only disallows
  changes based on clauses in the Proposal itself.

o Coercion to vote against conscience is still present if a penalty
  based on a Player's voting would occur even if the Proposal does not
  pass.  This penalty would obviously have to be imposed by another Rule
  already adopted, but it is the submission of the Proposal to which
  that Rule would apply that is the threat to make the penalty occur.
  Thus, a Rule stating "Any Player voting AGAINST Player X's next
  Proposal loses 10 Points" will have the paradoxical effect of not
  allowing Player X to make any more Proposals, since all of eir
  submissions are illegal under 1003/0.  It is only by desperate appeal
  to Game Custom that this Rule allows any Proposal submissions at all,
  since the presence of the F-A reward/penalty in 833/0 can be
  considered coercive of the vote of the Player who submits any
  Proposal!

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 783/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing,
      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have
      been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

Rule 833/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Reward or Penalty for Proposing

      When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
      F-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the
      number of votes AGAINST.  However, only the Votes of Voters
      shall be counted for this determination.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------

Injunction:

The Rulekeepor is enjoined to annotate Rule 1003/0 with the statement of
this CFJ, the list of relevant Rules including only 1003/0 itself.
(Rules 783/0 and 833/0 are included in the Judgement for reference
purposes only.)

======================================================================

Judgement of the Justiciar:  FALSE

I overturn JonRock's Judgement and find the Statement to be FALSE.

Rule 1003 prohibits the making of proposals whose obvious and direct
intent is to coerce a Player into voting against eir conscience. 
In effect, JonRock was asked to judge whether a proposal which
penalizes (or rewards) Players on the basis of how they vote on it
counts as coercive in the sense of Rule 1003. However, he chooses
in his Judgement to concentrate on the issue of whether it is the
Proposal or the Rule that the Proposal creates (ab initio or by 
amendment) that does the coercion. He ignores what seems to me
to be the more fundamental issue - in the sense that the truth
of the CFJ can be determined with respect to this issue alone 
without the complications considered by JonRock - which is whether
the threat of penalty alone is sufficient to establish the 
existence of coercion, or whether, in order to clearly establish 
the presence of coercion, it is necessary to further consider
the precise nature of the threat being made. 

In his Judgement, JonRock assumes without argument that the mere
existence of the threat of penalty implies coercion. In my judgement, 
this is a mistake. Coercion is the use of force to compel action.
Of course, drawing the line beyond which the pressure brought to bear
on an agent is considered to be coercive is a somewhat vague and
arbitrary matter, but we can nevertheless distinguish cases which
definitely fall on either side of that line. "Give me all your money or
I'll kill you" clearly is coercive; "Give me all your money or I'll
pinch you" clearly is not, no matter how unpleasant the pinching.
Clearly, in order to determine whether a threat of penalty is coercive
or not, it is necessary to inquire into the exact nature and severity
of the threatened penalty. So it is not true that Rule 1003 simply
prohibits the making of Proposals which threaten to penalize Players
on the basis of how they vote on it. While it may prohibit *some*
such Proposals, it will allow others. Hence I Judge that the Statement
is FALSE.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Speaker:  TRUE

Reasoning:
I first look at the definition of "coerce":

  coerce vb 1: REPRESS 2: COMPEL 3: ENFORCE

Hmm, not very helpful.  Next, I check

  repress vb 1: curb, subdue 2: restrain, suppress

  compel vb to drive or urge with force

  enforce vb 1: COMPEL (~ obedience by threats) 2: to execute
  with vigour (~ the law)

Aha, these are more helpful.  First, if "coerce" is meant in the sense
of "repress", a Proposal is coercive if only it curbs or restrains
certain Voting patterns; for example, giving rewards to Vote otherwise.
If "coerce" is meant in its second sense, a Proposal is coercive if it
uses some sort of force to "drive or urge" a Player to Vote one way over
another.  The way "coerce" is used, its third meaning makes no sense, as
Proposals cannot "execute with vigour" much of anything at all.

Then, taking the other meanings and applying them to the situation at
hand:  we have a Proposal, which is to Amend a Rule, and because of
something within that Proposal, some subset of Players may be penalized,
based on their Vote.  Clearly, then, that Proposal is urging those
Players to Vote in a certain way, using the force of the implied threat
of the Proposal actually passing.  It is subduing those who might Vote
another way into Voting a certain way. . . clearly, this is coercion.

Therefore, I Judge TRUE.

Vanyel

======================================================================

Judgement of the pro-Clerk of the Courts:  FALSE

   Justice Steve puts his finger on the essential flaw in the Statement,
   which would cancel any Proposal which might act against those voting in a 
   particular way, no matter how indirectly or slightly.

   Judge JonRock was correct to identify "coerce" as the threat of a 
   penalty, as opposed to the penalty itself.  However, coercion must
   also include a real and identifiable threat.

   Otherwise Proposal 1042 could be considered as in violation of this Rule,
   since it placed players not voting on it in the position of having to
   perform some other action within two weeks, or be deregistered. The 
   fact that probably no-one's conscience would prevent them from voting,
   or that the required action is trivial to perform, would not prevent
   the Statement of the CFJ from cancelling Proposal 1042.

   This is not to say that it is easy to draw the line between encouragement
   and coercion.  But clearly there is a distinction.  I do not know which
   side of the line Proposal 1535 (for example) falls on; but I have no
   hesitation in declaring the blanket prohibition in the Statement to be
   FALSE.

Statement:

"Acting Promotor Vanyel violated rule 783 by distributing proposal
1535."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Rule 783 states:
Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing, or otherwise
changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding of Points or any form of 
currency based on the Vote they cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not
be deemed to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted on.

Proposal 1535:
Amend our oldest Rule!

Amend Rule 312 to read:
If a Voter votes and if e voted FOR the Amendment of Rule 312,
e gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting Period.

[The obvious and direct intent of this Proposal is to redefine the
conditions upon which a Player will receive the Vote award.
As such it does not conflict with 1003.]

Proposal 1535 penalizes players who don't vote FOR it, and is in violation of
rule 783

#### Note: ####
I don't think the EV proposals violate this, because they award EVs (a
currency) based on votes on _other_ proposals.
Of course by this reasoning I would also call a proposal such as:
'every time a Player votes for a proposal submitted by Pascal, e receives 10
points'
legal...
IMO, the coersion (sp?) and bonus clause rules need to be revised...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

[[Caller Pascal integrates his References into his Argument]]

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE.

Rule 783 specifically states that any Proposals "which contain clauses
awarding" ... "Points" ... "based on the Vote they cast on that Proposal" 
are "invalid, shall not be deemed to have been properly submitted, and
shall not be Voted upon."  Since Proposal 1535 specifically awards Points 
to Players based on their Voting FOR Proposal 1535, by Rule 783 this 
Proposal invalid, not properly submitted, and should not have been Voted 
upon.  The fact that the Points are not awarded immediately is immaterial 
- Rule 783 does not specify a time limit in which the Point awards must 
take place, and the stated awards on future Proposals are directly tied 
to the Players' Votes on 1535.

However:

While I believe that Proposal 1535 was indeed "invalid", "not properly 
submitted" and should "not have been Voted upon", the fact remains that 
at no place in Rule 783 does it say that the Promotor shall not 
distribute such an invalid Proposal, nor does any other Rule I have been 
able to ascertain.  Therefore, in no way did Acting Promoter Vanyel 
violate Rule 783 by distributing Proposal 1535, and I am constrained to 
find this CFJ FALSE.

I would like to note that, while the I believe the submission of this 
Proposal to be legal, I suspect that all Votes cast on it, including 
this Judges, were NOT legal, and should not be counted., by virtue of 
Rule 783.

======================================================================

Statement:

"Rule 833 and 1438 must be interpretated as such, that the F-A Points,
that a Player gets, when the voting Period for a Proposal is over, are
a punitive pointloss, in those cases where F-A turns out to be negative."

Barred Players: Andre, Swann, Vanyel

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

1438 explicitly excludes pointlosses that are:
"the direct result of submission of or Voting on a Proposal"
as being Punitive.

But a `direct result' is a result that stems immediately from a source,
cause, or reason, which in the case of the F-A pointloss is not true.

The F-A pointloss is the result of a number of causes, that act together:
- the Player submitted the Proposal
- the Proposal was distributed
- the Proposal was voted upon
- more Players voted AGAINST than voted FOR
- the F-A points were not halved by virtue of Rule 1061
- the Speaker/Assessor did not forget to report the Points, which
would cancel the score change. This might be farfetched but is not.
What happens if the score change is not reported? There will be a
Claim of Error; the error will be corrected; but in that case the
pointloss (now applied after all) has changed its nature, as an
"Adjustments made as part of a correction in the Game State" can
never be punitive (1438 again).

An F-A Pointloss is therefore hardly the direct result of the
submission or the vote in itself.

Consequently, the Pointloss is punitive.

Note:
this CFJ envisages to counter Andre's bid for a Championship using
Points earned in a previous Game and hibernated in the Reform Treasury.
The failure of 1529 resulted in -7 F-A points, which (if considered
Punitive) would result in a number of Blots.
And one is enough....

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 833/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Reward or Penalty for Proposing

      When the voting period for a proposal is over, the proposer gets
      F-A points, where F is the number of votes FOR, and A is the
      number of votes AGAINST.  However, only the Votes of Voters
      shall be counted for this determination.
      (*Was: 544*)


Rule 1061/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Bonus to New Players

      For the first five consecutive Nomic Weeks following the
      registration of a Player who has not played in this Nomic
      previously, that Player shall receive 5 Points for each
      week in which e submits one or more Proposals to the Speaker,
      and any penalties which are the direct result of voting on
      such Proposals are halved; all of these shall be reported to
      the Scorekeepor by the Speaker.


Rule 1438/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots Due to a Punititve Point Loss

      A Punitive Point Loss is a point loss that results in gaining
      Blots.

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Punitive Point loss, the Player
      losing Points will receive Blots equal to half the number of
      Points lost, rounded down.

      Punitive Point Losses are those losses *not* due to:

         i) Voluntary transfers of Points to any other Player or any
            other Nomic Entity.
        ii) Voluntary destruction of a Player's own Points.
       iii) the direct result of submission of or Voting on a Proposal
        iv) Adjustments made as part of a correction in the Game
            State.
         v) The reset of scores due to the end of a Game.
        vi) A score change that a Rule specifically designates as
            Non-Punitive.
       vii) Rules that also adjust the number of Blots a Player has.

      Further, a Point Loss ceases to be Punitive when the Rule
      mandating the Loss is amended to explicitly state either of the
      following:

         i) The Rule does not impose a Blot penalty.
        ii) The Rule does impose a Blot penalty, the amount of the
            Blot penalty, and the Player responsible for reporting
            those Blots to the Tabulator.

      Players Legally Responsible for reporting Punitive Point losses
      to the Scorekeepor also have the Legal Responsibility to report
      Blots due to those Punitive Point losses to the Tabulator.

      This Rule shall remain in effect until there are no longer any
      Punitive Point Losses defined in the Ruleset, at which point
      this Rule will repeal itself.

History:
Created by Proposal 1459, Mar. 1 1995
Amended(1) by Proposal 1495, Mar. 15 1995

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

Rule 1438 explicitly excludes point losses that are "the direct result 
of submission of or Voting on a Proposal" as being Punitive.

TAL's argument is that F-A point losses are not "directly" the result of 
voting.  In support of this, he offered a variety of circumstances which
must be present for F-A points to be lost, and others which might prevent 
or modify the point loss.

Under this interpretation, it is hard to see that _anything_ would count
as being the "direct" result of voting.

A more sensible interpretation is to say that a point loss is the 
direct result of voting if there is a rule directing that a certain
voting outcome results in the point loss.  That is:  if a Rule says 
"if A, then X", X is the direct result of A.

It would be "indirect" if the Rules specified some intermediate cause 
between the voting and the point loss.  That is, if the rules instead
say "if A, then B", and "if B, then X",  X is an indirect result of A.

Nor is it necessary for "directness" that the voting be the sole cause 
of the result.  If the Rule says "if A and B, then X", X is the direct
result of A and B together, and can be thought of as a direct result
of either.

Thus a Proposal to award the Scamster Title, if adopted, would cause a 
Punitive Point loss of 1 Point.  This is a result of the voting, but not 
a "direct" result, since there is an intermediate cause:  the voting
causes the adoption of the proposal and the award of the Scamster title,
and the award of the title causes the point loss.

Under this interpretation an F-A point loss is "the direct result of
voting", by Rule 833.

Statement:

"The latest Score report (dated March 26) has TAL's score in error,
as it did not take into account the Officer salaries TAL should have

Barred Players: KoJen, Chuck

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

According to Rule 1007 `Officers shall receive a salary of 3 Points
per week, unless another Rule explicitly states another salary',
while according to Rule 1006 `An Officer is any Player who has been
Appointed or Elected to an Office specified in the Rules.'

Well, in the past I have been CotC and I have been Scorekeepor.
That makes me still an Officer according to 1006 and therefore I presume
I have right to the 3 Points falling each Monday to Officers.

In this case that means all Mondays since the start of the current
Game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References:

Rule 1007/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Default Salary of Officers

      Officers (excluding Viziers, Ordinancekeepors, and any other
      Officers whose duties pertain only to a single Group) shall
      receive a salary of 3 Points per week, unless another Rule
      explicitly states another salary.

Rule 1006/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Officer is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.

      An Officer may be replaced by another Player by a Directive to
      install that Player into the Office.  The Proposal containing
      such a Directive shall have an Adoption Index of at least 1.

      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.

      If an Officer resigns while a Referendum is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player thus proposed will by eis Successor.

      An Officer shall be appointed only if e consents.

      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

History:
...
Amended(1) by Proposal 1336, Nov. 22 1994

======================================================================

Judgment:  TRUE

Explanation: First, I note that I was strongly tempted to decline judgement
             for I am in a situation similar to TAL.  I have served as
             Banker and Clerk of the Courts over the history of this game
             and could conceivably benefit from this decision.  But I note
             that much of the Agora community is also in this situation and
             for me to disqualify myself just because my own situation could
             be affected could set a precedent that would leave us with a
             critically small pool of potential justices.  I believe that
             I can decide this case on its merits without the possible benefit
             affecting my judgement.

             Rule 1006/1 is quite clear in its definition of an Officer as
             "any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to an Office
             specified in the Rules." TAL certainly meets this criterion.
             Now Rule 1006/1 also states that "An Officer may resign at any
             time, provided e appoints a successor."  One might argue an
             Officer ceases to be an Officer at the point where e resigns
             eis last Office.  I contend that if that were the case Rule
             1006/1 would have stated that an Officer is any Player who
             currently hold an Office specified in the Rules or some similar
             statement.  Furthermore, I note in Rule 880/0, which TAL did not
             cite, that "No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office."
             If one ceases to be an Officer when one resigns the Office, then
             the language in Rule 880 is redundant.  It seems apparent that
             the author of Rule 880 believed that Officers remained Officers
             even when not holding Office.  Thus I find that TAL was an
             Officer and remained an Officer even after he resigned his Office.

             Having reached this conclusion, Rule 1007/0 quite clearly states
             that all Officers, and not just those holding Office, shall
             receive a salary of 3 Points per week, unless another Rule
             explicitly says another salary.  Since there is no Rule specifying
             another salary for former officeholders, TAL should be paid
             the 3 Points per week salary specified in Rule 1007/0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Rule 1011 (Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed) and
Rule 692 (Trading Points) which normally prohibit the two transfers
are both preceeded by 1446. Thus both transfers are legal, the
first being allowed by good old 116.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References (contest announcement and various Rules):

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CONTEST

Name: Scam Contest
Regulations:

1) The Contest has at most one participant
2) The initial Contestmaster is TAL, until 1 second after he
    becomes Contestant. No other provision for a Contestmaster
    is given in these Regulations
3) The entry fee is 1 Point
4) Immediately after the one and only participant has paid his fee,
   300 Points shall be transfered from the Abelian Group to the
   Scam Contest fund.

==========
In case you wondered, this transfer is allowed because Rule 1446 states:
"This Rule takes precedence over
 all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
 transfers are legal and/or taxable"

1446 therefore takes precedence over Rule 1011 (Game Entities May Not
Be Arbitrarily Changed) ]

==========
Scorekeepor, please take note: I, TAL,  transfer 1 Point to the Scam
Contest Fund, thusly becoming the one and only Participant.

Immediately 300 Points are transfered from the Abelian Group Treasury
to the Scam Contest Fund.

One second later, the Scam Contest no longer has a Contestmaster and
is dissolved. By Rule 1446 the contents of the Scam Contest Fund is
divided over the partipants.

Hence TAL receives 301 Points, enough to win the current game.

==========

Rule 116/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.


Rule 692/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
      any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient has more
           than than 90% of the Points required to Win, or would pass
           this limit as a result of the transfer.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

Rule 1011/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.
      (*Was: 450*)

Rule 1446/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      score changes and currency transfers taking place under the
      Regulations, administers the Contest Fund, and maintains the
      Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is an entity capable of owning, trading, and
      spending Points or Currencies in the same manner as a Player,
      but only as authorized by the Regulations.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        - how the Contestmaster is replaced,
        - how currencies and Points are transferred to or from the
          Contest Fund,
        - the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, which shall be
          in Points,
        - additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
        - how the Regulations may be changed, and
        - ways for the Contest to be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or as otherwise provided in the
      rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants.

      If according to the Regulations the Contest Fund must transfer
      Points and/or currency to a Contestant, and the Fund does not
      have sufficient resources, then enough of the Contestmaster's
      Points and/or currency are transferred to the Fund to cover the
      transaction.

      If e does not have sufficient Points or currency to accomplish
      this, then each Contestant is given back eir entry fee, and the
      Contestmaster loses the number of Points of the returned entry
      fees. The Contest is then dissolved.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

      This transfer is not taxable.  This Rule takes precedence over
      all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
      transfers are legal and/or taxable, or which would assign Blots
      to any Player.

======================================================================

Judgement:  TRUE

In the matter of Call for Judgement Number 760, I hereby enter a
Judgement of TRUE, for the reasons detailed below.

Rule 1446 declares that a Contest is created when an announcement of
the Contest is posted to the Public Forum, specifying the Name and
Regulations of the Contest.  TAL did so by posting the announcement to
nomic-business, which has been designated by the Distributor as a
Public Forum at approximately 16:59 UTC on 3 Apr 1995.

The Regulations specify TAL as Contestmaster initially, which is
consistent with Rule 1446.  TAL is a Player, according to the most
recent Registrar's Report.

I therefore find that the Scam Contest was legally created.  I also
find that TAL legally joined the Contest, at the same time it was
created (or, for the quantum time people, at a time T seconds later,
where T is the smallest unit of time allowed by natural law).

As to the first transfer, from Abelian Group's Treasury to the Contest
Fund, I find that it was only legal, but not of the size claimed by
TAL in his message to the Public Forum.  The Regulations are
permitted, by 1446, to specify the manner in which currencies and
Points are transferred to or from the Contest Fund.  I interpret this
to mean that the Regulations of a Contest may, under conditions
specified in the Regulations, require transfers into the Contest Fund
from other sources.  I cannot find any specific Rule which would
prohibit a transfer out of a Group's Treasury, aside from Rule 1011.
But Rule 1011 does not apply in this case, because 1446 grants
legislative authority to effect transfers of Points to and from
Contests Funds, which is exactly what the first transfer is.  Also,
Rule 692 does not apply, because 692 deals with trading points between
Players, and this transfer was neither to nor from a Player.  The last
paragraph of 692, which requires that "all Nomic Entities ...  abide
by the [specified] limits whenever points are traded", does not
prevent this transfer, although it does restrict it.  The transfer was
posted to the Public Forum; and it was for a positive number of
points.  Clause (d) does not apply because a Contest Fund may not win.
Clause (c), however, limits the transfer to the number of Points in
the Contest Fund, which at the time of the transfer was 1.  Hence, I
find that the transfer is legal in principle, but that the size of the
transfer is limited to one Point.  Rule 1442 attempts to claim
precedence, as TAL notes in his Arguments; however, 692 _also_ claims
precedence.  By Rule 1030, therefore, 692 takes precedence by the
numerical method.

Since the question placed before me in this CFJ is whether the
transfer is legal, I find that it is, in fact, legal.

As to the second transfer, I also find that it is legal, although not
of the size alleged to by TAL in his message to the Public Forum.  One
second after TAL entered the Contest, which I find he did, the Contest
had no Contestmaster.  Hence, it is dissolved by Rule 1442, and its
Contest Fund distributed amongst the Contestants, which is to say,
TAL.  Hence, TAL does receive the entire contents of the Contest Fund:
two points.

Again, the same argument which limits the size of the first transfer
would have applied to limit the size of the second transfer; Rule 692
and Rule 1446 both claim precedence.  By Rule 1030, 692 therefore has
precedence.

It is therefore the finding of this Court that both transfers are
legal, and that this CFJ is TRUE.  However, it is the nonbinding
opinion of this Court that the size of these transfers is misstated in
TAL's message to the Public Forum; specifically, the first transfer
from Abelian's Treasury to the Scam Contest Fund is of 1 Point, not
300, and the second transfer, from the Scam Contest Fund to TAL is of
2 Points, not 301.

Respectfully submitted this 3rd day of April, 1995,

Kelly Martin

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional evidence:

Rule 1030/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Precedence Between Conflicting Rules

      There are two types of conflicts between rules: (a) conflicts
      between rules with the same Mutability Indices; (b) conflicts
      between rules with different Mutability Indices.

      (a) Conflicts between Rules with the same Mutability Indices:

      If two or more Rules with the same Mutability Indices conflict
      with one another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

      (b) Conflicts between Rules with different Mutability Indices:

      In a conflict between rules with different Mutability
      Indices, the rule with the higher Mutability Index takes
      precedence over the Rule with the lower Mutability Index. 

History:
...
Amended(1) by Proposal 1527, Mar. 24 1995

======================================================================

Judgement of the pro-Clerk of the Courts:  FALSE

The first transfer was legal by the loophole in Rule 692 (though modified 
to 1 Point).  The second transfer was not legal since the Scam Contest 
cannot be dissolved.


THE FIRST TRANSFER:  ABELIAN GROUP to SCAM CONTEST FUND

I accept the argument of Judge Kelly, that the first transfer is legal,
though not in the amount claimed.

Rule 1446 says that Contest Funds may transfer Points in the same 
manner as a Player.  Rule 692 says that a Player may transfer Points 
to any other Player, subject to certain limits.

It does not say "transfer Points in eir possession."  This is the same 
omission already repaired in the Rule 1040 and Rule 614. We just never 
thought to repair it in Rule 692.

As Judge Kelly points out, this transfer is still subject to the limits
imposed by 692(c), and is therefore modified by the last paragraph of
Rule 692, and the Contest Fund trades the maximum which would be allowed,
namely 1 Point.


THE SECOND TRANSFER:  SCAM CONTEST FUND to TAL

The second transfer is the transfer from Scam Contest Fund to TAL.
There is no legal way such a transfer can take place.

Rule 1446 permits Regulations to specify how the Contestmaster may
be replaced.  This is different from saying that they have the power
to vacate the Contestmastership.

TAL became Contestmaster when he posted the Scam Contest announcement.
The Regulations do not specify any way of replacing the Contestmaster,
and hence he remains Contestmaster.  Since the Contest continues to 
have a Contestmaster, it does not auto-dissolve under Rule 1446.

The Regulations do not specify any other way of dissolving the Contest, 
and so the Contest is not dissolved.  Therefore the disbursal under
Rule 1446 does not take place.

There is no regulation authorizing the Contest Fund to transfer Points
to a Contestant.  Rule 1446 says that the Fund may make transfers, but 
only as authorized by the regulations.  Hence the transfer cannot 
take place, either as a dissolution disbursement, or as an ordinary 
Contest transfer.


--Justice ElJefe

======================================================================

Judgement of the Justiciar: FALSE

I Judge that the Statement is FALSE. Justice eljefe has provided
convincing and cogent arguments to the effect that the first transfer
is legal, though not of the size reported by TAL, but that the second
transfer is illegal because the Scam Contest cannot be dissolved.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Speaker: FALSE

I judge FALSE for several reasons.  First, let me quote a few salient
points.

>From the Contest Announcement:

> 4) Immediately after the one and only participant has paid his fee,
>    300 Points shall be transfered from the Abelian Group to the
>    Scam Contest fund.

Since TAL did, undoubtedly, transfer the Entry Fee, Regulation 4 is
invoked.  The Scam Contest attempts to transfer 300 points from Abelian
to the SC Fund.

Rule 116, in its entirety:

> Rule 116/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
> Permissibility of the Unprohibited
> 
>       Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
>       and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
>       which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
>       implicitly permits it.

This is often taken to mean that what isn't *prohibited* is legal.  But,
it must be remembered that *regulation* counts to prevent invocation of
116, too.

Selections from Rule 692:

> Rule 692/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
> Trading Points
> 
>       A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
>       any purpose, within the following limits:
>        [...]
>        (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
>
>       [...]
>
>       All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
>       Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
>       current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
>       the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
>       breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
>       precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
>       Points.

That first sentence is worthless in our case, as it only applies if
Points are *traded*, which is two-way.  But the rest of the paragraph
may be helpful: a Nomic Entity (the SC) must trade by current Rules, but
breaks the limits (the Scam Contest owns 0 Points and attempts to
transfer 300 Points).  So, the NE (the SC) trades the max possible (0)
without breaking limits.  This Rule, numbered 692, attempts to take
Precedence.

>From Rule 1011:

> Rule 1011/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
> Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed
> 
>       Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
>       only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
>       Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
>       action other than those specified by the Rules.
>       [...]

It is impossible for this to take effect in the current case, as the
Actions taken *are* specified, and regulated.

>From Rule 1446:

> Rule 1446/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
> Contests
> 
>       [...]
> 
>       The Contest Fund is an entity capable of owning, trading, and
>       spending Points or Currencies in the same manner as a Player,
>       but only as authorized by the Regulations.

Note, please, that there are *TWO* entities at work here: the Contest,
and the Contest Fund.  The Scam Contest seems to be the one possessing
the Regulations, and the Contest Fund holds the Points--meaning that the
Contest can't transfer Points, period, as it doesn't own any (see part c
of the Points Transfer Rule).  Indeed, there may even be three (the
Contest, the CF, and the Regs), depending on your reading of the Rule.

>       The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
>       Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
>       except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
>       specify:
>         - how the Contestmaster is replaced,
>         - how currencies and Points are transferred to or from the
>           Contest Fund,

The Scam Contest Regulations do specify how currencies are transferred;
does this automatically mean these transfers are executed?  I assume so,
but it's not really explicit, as I think about it.

>       [...]
> 
>       This transfer is not taxable.  This Rule takes precedence over
>       all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
>       transfers are legal and/or taxable, or which would assign Blots
>       to any Player.

This Rule, numbered 1011, attempts to take precedence; 692 also does.
Therefore 692 wins, and Points are transferred only as according to it.
That is to say, not at all.  Thus, the transfer of 300 Points is *not* a
legal transfer (although the Rules do modify it so that it becomes so).

Note that if this Appeal overturns Player Kelly's Judgement in the
matter, for reasons very similar to the ones given in eir own Judgement,
I do not believe the resultant Point loss should be reported by the
CotC; if it is, I will recompense em for eir loss.

======================================================================

Statement:

I hereby Call For Judgement on the intreptation of Rule 692. The
correct interpretation prohibits Points from being transferred from a
Player who is not the Player requesting the transfer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments & References:

Rule 692 is as follows:

Rule 692/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
      any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient has more
           than than 90% of the Points required to Win, or would pass
           this limit as a result of the transfer.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

In the absence of any specified "from" in the first sentence, and in the
absence of any special meaning for "transfer" defined in Agora, this can only
be taken to mean a transfer from the Entity requesting the transfer. Long
estabilished Game custom is consistent with this.

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

Arguments:
"A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
 any purpose, within the following limits.." (Rule 692) does, in
general, not prohibit the transfer of points from another Player
than the Player who is doing the transfer.

Here is the dictionary definition:
trans.fer \'trans-.f*r\ n
  1: conveyance of right, title, or interest in property from one
     person to another
  2: an act or process of transferring
  3: one that transfers or is transferred
  4: a ticket entitling a passenger on a public conveyance to
     continue his journey on another route

It seems that 1) applies to the `transfer' mentioned in Rule 692.

However, KoJen appealed to Game Custom to justify the Statement.
As far as I know, no Player to Player transfers were ever made other
than from a Player A to a Player B, requested by A.
But I don't think that the lack of such transfers would therefore
exclude them.

I, for instance, never made a point transfer from myself to Elde,
but I don't think that this implies therefore that such transfers are
excluded by Game Custom.

An other argument is that such `irregular' transfers were at one
time allowed for Marks. And although it took awhile before somebody
did so, eventually it did happen.

Nor does the Spirit of the Game exclude such point transfers. If
anything, the S of the G would *encourage* such transfers.

Conclusion: the type of transfers mentioned in the Statement are not
prohibited and therefore allowed by 116 (no doubt our most frequently
invoked Rule.)

Note: this Judgment is a licence for theft. Any Player who wants to
win a game and who doesn't care to become an Honourless Worm in the
mean time, can go ahead. But be quick about it, a cure of 692 is in
the works.

References:


Rule 116/0 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

Rule 692/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
      any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient has more
           than than 90% of the Points required to Win, or would pass
           this limit as a result of the transfer.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

Statement:

"As only those Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed
in a Proposal, obviously the paragraphs

>Directive I:
>"Coren shall be dismissed as Sweepstake Officer."
>
>Directive II:
>"The Player being currently the Banker, shall be dismissed."

are not part of Proposal 1543."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Proposal 1543 seemingly contains two Directives. However these socalled
Directives (quoted in the statement) are of a type that is not defined
in the Rules. By Rule 993 they may therefore not be placed in a
Proposal. Consequently they are not part of the Proposal. (Maybe they
were commentary? A sort of Statement of Intent?)

Note: the real 1543, the part that should be voted upon is
>Proposal 1543 (TAL) Short
>Adoption Index: 1
>
>Directives to abolish Offices.
>
>Amend Rule 1006 by adding at its end:
>"When an Office no longer exist, a Directive to dismiss the Officer

Rule 993/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

======================================================================

Judgement:  TRUE
 
Argument:
 
It is my opinion that there are no such thing as "Directives 
which are not defined by the rules", as the only reasonable 
way to find out whether something is a Directive is to look at 
the definition of "Directive". And it is game custom to let 
definitions in the rules take precedence over everyday 
defintions. 
 
So, as Directives are defined in the rules, we have to use these
definitions to judge whether or not something is a Directive. 
And as the two lines labelled "Directive I" and "Directive II" 
do not fit into this definition (or at least, did not at the 
time the proposal was made), we must assume they are NOT 
Directives.
 
It appears to me that these lines do not fall under any of the 
other required or permitted parts of a Proposal as defined in 
the rules, so it is game custom to assume that they are comments.
 
As to whether these comments are part of the proposal, it 
appears to also be game custom that any text included with a 
proposal, which could not affect the game state (if the prop 
passed) is regarded as "not part of the proposal". Take, for 
example rule 597/1.
 
Therefore, it seems clear to me that the text quoted in the
Statement, although it was included with proposal 1543, and may
be distributed with it, was not part of the proposal.

Additional Evidence:

Rule 597/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Titles for Proposals
 
      Every Proposal shall be headed with a Title. This Title shall
      not actually be a part of the Proposal itself and therefore
      shall not become a part of any Rule Enacted or Amended by that
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not headed with a Title, then the
      proposal is not properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Justiciar:  FALSE

I overturn Judge Blob's initial Judgement, and Judge that the Statement
is FALSE.

It appears to me that the truth of the Statement depends upon the
answers to two different questions. As we shall see, I think that
only the first of these questions is really important; the answer to
the second question, while affecting whether we say that the
Statement is TRUE or FALSE, is perhaps as much a matter of taste as
anything else.

The important question raised by the Statement is: did Proposal 1543
contain any Directives at all? In this matter I think that Blob
Judged correctly that it did not. It is worth repeating here in this
Official context my belief that there are not two kinds of Directives, 
those defined by the Rules and those not defined by the Rules. Rather, 
as Blob argued, the Rules define what is a Directive, and anything
not satisfying this definition is no kind of Directive at all.
Neither of the text fragments in Proposal 1543 which purport to be
Directives satisfy this definition, and so neither of these fragments
can be held to be Directives. So Proposal 1543 did not contain any
Directives.

The second question now arises: if Proposal 1543 did not contain any
Directives, then what exactly did it contain? Specifically, did it
contain any text fragments purporting to be Directives? Blob in his
Judgement argued that "these lines do not fall under any of the
other required or permitted parts of a Proposal as defined in
the rules, so it is game custom to assume that they are comments",
and he goes on to argue from this that it is "game custom that any
text included with a proposal, which could not affect the game
state...is regarded as 'not part of the proposal'." He gives the
example of Titles (Rule 597).

I think this is a questionable line of argument. Firstly, the Rules
are fairly permissive in their approach to what may be contained in
a Proposal. Basically we are told that a Proposal may contain Rule
Changes (Rule 594) and Directives (Rule 993). But we are never told
that Proposals may not contain anything which is neither a Rule
Change nor a Directive. But secondly, I don't think game custom is 
as clear on the matter of whether comments are regarded as part of 
a proposal as Judge Blob would have it be. True, we are told that
Titles are not part of a Proposal, but I think it would be a mistake
to generalize from the special case of Titles to the more general
case of comments. For example, there is the occasional habit of some
Players of including, along with proposed amendments and creations,
requests to the Rulekeepor to give the newly created or amended Rule
a particular Title. These requests have no legal force, of course, but
I think it would be awkward if we were to regard them as not part of
the Proposals in which they (apparently) appear, particularly as they
may be gramatically intertwined with sentences specifying the nature
of a Rule Change that the Proposal is proposing. If one was to state
this as a general principle, it would be this: that it is better to
allow Proposals to come in easily identified chunks, without having
to worry about which parts of the chunk are really a part of the
Proposal and which are not, and to allow some parts of the Proposal
to be passive and without any legal effects, than it is to require 
that only those parts of a document submitted as a Proposal, which
will, if adopted, have some legal effect, are to be considered a part
of that Proposal. The latter alternative seems complicated and 
distasteful to me, and contrary to commonsense.

It is therefore my Judgement that while Proposal 1543 contained no
Directives, it did contain text fragments which purported to be
Directives, and hence that the Statement is FALSE.

======================================================================

Judgement of the Clerk of the Courts:  FALSE

Arguments:

I concur with Blob insofar as it is evident that there can not be
such a thing as a "Directive which is not defined by the rules." I also
concur that, as Blob argued, the lines of the Proposal in question,
labelled "Directive I" and "Directive II" can not be Directives, because
no such "Directives" are defined in the Rules.  I will not go into that
argument again, since that ground is well trod, and now seems generally agreed 
upon.

The question then falls, is the remainder of Blob's argument valid?

Specifically, the following 2 paragraphs:

  "It appears to me that these lines do not fall under any of the 
   other required or permitted parts of a Proposal as defined in 
   the rules, so it is game custom to assume that they are comments.
 
   As to whether these comments are part of the proposal, it 
   appears to also be game custom that any text included with a 
   proposal, which could not affect the game state (if the prop 
   passed) is regarded as "not part of the proposal". Take, for 
   example rule 597/1."

Hmmmm.  I have scrounged through the Ruleset, and I have actually found
nothing that really defines the "required or permitted" part of a
Proposal.  There are rules that define how a Proposal is submitted (Rule
1036/2) and what text is required to be attached (Rule 597/1) but nothing that 
limits the content of Proposals themselves.  Now there are
explicit limits on the content and form of Directives and of Rule
Changes and up until recently there has been a de-facto limit on the
number of Rule Creations a Proposal could contain because of the form
of Rule Numbering, which has since been decoupled from Proposal
numbering... all of these are indirect limits.  There is no Rule that
someone can not submit a Proposal as follows:

   "Proposal 9999
    This Text is a Proposal

    This Proposal contains no Rule Changes or Directives."

This Proposal obviously contains some text (or else it wouldn't exist.)
But by Blob's reasoning, since this text does not change the Game state,
it is not part of the Proposal.  This, I think, is wrong--

As a counterexample to Blob's mentioning of Proposal Titles, which Rule
597/1 explicitly states are not part of a Proposal, (making 597/1 an
invalid example of how extraneous text is treated) I offer a careful 
examination of 1339/2 which shows that such declarations as in the example 
above are more often than not treated as part of the Proposal.

In 1339/2, the lines and declarations that preface the text of a 
Rule Change are, themselves, implicitly part of that Rule Change and thus part 
of a proposal that contains the Rule Change.

Example from 1339/2:

     "Any Rule Change which affects an existing Rule must clearly
      identify the Number of the Rule to be affected."

Thus in the following example:

     "Proposal 9999
      A Pointless Amendment.

      Amend Rule 1339/2 by adding the following text:

      "fnord.""

The line contenting the Number of the Amended Rule is part of the Rule
Change, and part of the Proposal. (Otherwise, the "Rule Change" cannot be 
clearly identifying the Number of the Rule being Amended, as 1339/2
requires.)  The Title, "A Pointless Amendment" is *only* excluded from
being part of the Proposal by the specific language of Rule 597/2.

There is nothing similar to the language of Rule 1339/2 to define the
status of the declarations prefacing Directives.  However, I believe
that both Logic and Game Custom are contrary to Blob's argument.

I maintain that if in this:

  "Proposal 9999
   Create Nothing.

   Let the following rule be Created (and placed in the Category
   "Nada"):

   "This rule does nothing, and takes precedence over any rule that
    demands it to do anything.""

the sentence "Let the following . ." is part of the Proposal (which it
clearly *is* via the sixth paragraph of 1339/2) then, in the following
example:

   "Proposal 9999
    A Legal Directive.

    Directive I:

    The Player who is now holding the Office of Herald is hereby
    replaced by Swann."

the sentence "Directive I:" is likewise part of the Proposal.

And, following the same logic, if in this:

   "Proposal 9999
    Illegally Does Nothing.

    Amend Rule 1339/2 by deleting the word "fnord.""

the sentence is part of the Proposal, even if the Proposal has no effect (there 
being no word "fnord" to be deleted) then in this:

  "Proposal 1543 (TAL) Short
   Adoption Index: 1

   Directives to abolish Offices.

   Amend Rule 1006 by adding at its end:
   "When an Office no longer exist, a Directive to dismiss the Officer
    may be proposed."

   Directive I:
   "Coren shall be dismissed as Sweepstake Officer."

   Directive II:
   "The Player being currently the Banker, shall be dismissed.""

at the very least, the sentences "Directive I:" and "Directive II:" are
part of the Proposal.  The text those lines refer to, are not, however,
Directives.

Now, Rule 993/1 says that only Directives defined by the Rules may be
placed in a Proposal.  However I, as well as the majority of Judicial
opinion, maintain that the only kind of Directive that exist are those 
defined within the Rules.  There is no such thing as an illegal or
undefined Directive, there are only Directives, and non-Directives.  The
text in question is obviously the latter.  I also think that it is clear
that extraneous text *does* in fact become part of a Proposal, but Game
Custom is that such text has no effect when the Rules do not give a
meaning to such text.  This is the case in TAL's proposal, the fact that the 
text did not contain Directives, as defined by the Rules, did not exclude these 
sentences from being part of a Proposal, just as Amendments to non-existent 
parts of a Rule do not exclude themselves from their Proposals.

The Statement, as worded, is FALSE.

Rule 1339/2 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Rule Changes

      There are two types of Rule Change. A Proposed Rule Change is a
      Rule Change which appears in a Proposal, and which, insofar as
      the Rules permit it to take effect, has the effect of Creating,
      Amending, Mutating, Repealing or otherwise changing a Rule as
      defined elsewhere in the Rules, directly as a result of the
      passage of a Proposal. A non-Proposed Rule Change has the same
      effect as a Proposed Rule Change, but insofar as the Rules
      permit it to take effect, it does so not as the direct result
      of the passage of a Proposal, but rather, indirectly, as the
      result of the effect or action of a Rule.

      All Rule Changes, of either type, are subject to the following
      constraints:

      An individual Rule Change must change exactly one Rule.

      Any Rule Change which affects an existing Rule must clearly
      identify the Number of the Rule to be affected.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Mutability Index of the New Rule; however, if the Mutability
      Index is specified it must be greater than or equal to 1.  If
      the Mutability Index of any Rule created by a Rule Change is not
      specified, it shall be 1.

      Any Rule Change which creates a New Rule may specify the
      Category to which the New Rule will be assigned.  If the
      Category specified exists, the Rule shall be assigned to that
      Category.  If the Category specified does not exist, or no
      Category is specified, the Rulekeepor shall assign the Rule to
      an appropriate category of eir own choice.

      Any Rule Change which changes the Mutability Index of a Rule
      must clearly specify the new value of the Rule's Mutability
      Index.

      Any Rule Change which changes the text of a Rule must clearly and
      unambigiously specify the changes which are to be made. If the
      Rule Change quotes old text which is to be replaced with new
      text, then the quoted old text must match exactly with actual
      text in the Rule, with the exception of whitespace and
      capitalization. This takes precedence over Rules which would
      permit such differences, even if the differences would be
      considered inconsequential by such Rules.

      Any Rule Change which does not meet these criteria shall not
      have any legal force.

Judgement of the Speaker:  FALSE

I overturn the judgement to be FALSE. I think I can be short in stating my
point, as I agree with Steve (one could also say that Steve agrees with me, as
I had already stated this point of view in my Call for Appeal).

I agree with the caller that the would-be Directives are NOT of any form of
Directive allowed by the rules, and therefore are NOT Directives. However, in
spite of what the caller and the Judge said, and in agreement with the
Justiciar, I judge that Game Custom tells us that Proposals may contain parts
which are neither Rule Changes nor Directives, even though such parts have no
legal force.

The main example has already been given by Steve, namely remarks regarding
the (unofficial) titles of Rules. Another example might be the fact that, if
not now then sometime in the past, the text of the thesis was part of the
proposal to request a Degree.

There are some things which are considered to be NOT part of a Proposal, but
these are exceptions, either entrenched in the Rule (Titles), or through Game
Custom (Commentary). The normal way is that anything contained in a Proposal is
indeed part of the Proposal.

Barred Player: Andre

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

1443 states that "A proposal which passes, and which was proto-proposed
in the same *form*" earns its submitter two points. Well, what is the
form of a proto-Proposal? It can not mean `exactly the same' as that
is contradictory to the usual meaning of the word `form':

form \'fo_.rm\ n
  1: SHAPE, STRUCTURE
  2: a body esp. of a person : FIGURE
  3: the essential nature of a thing
  4: established manner of doing a thing or saying something
  5: FORMULA
  6: a printed or typed document with blank spaces for insertion of
     requested information <tax form>
  7: CEREMONY, CONVENTIONALITY
  8: manner or style of performing according to recognized standards
  9: a long seat : BENCH
  10: a frame model of the human figure used for displaying clothes
  11: MOLD <a form for concrete>
  12: type or plates in a frame ready for printing
  13: MODE, KIND, VARIETY <coal is a form of carbon>
  14: orderly method of arrangement; also : a particular kind or
     instance of such arrangement <the sonnet form in poetry>
  15: the structural element, plan, or design of a work of art
  16: a bounded surface or volume
  17: a grade in a British secondary school or in some American
     private schools
  18: a table with information on the past performances of racehorses
  19: known ability to perform; also : condition (as of an athlete)
     suitable for performing
  20: one of the ways in which a word is changed to show difference
     in use <the plural form of a noun>


So the question is, when was a Proposal submitted in the same form
as the proto? This can only be so, when the proto obeyed the same
Rules concerning the form as the Proposals. No more. Specifically,
nothing is said about the similarity in *content* of proto and
Proposal.

Therefore *any* proto posted to the Public Forum within the given
time limit would seem to fulfill that requirement.

      same form between four and fourteen days before being submitted
      as a proposal, shall earn its proposer an extra two points at
      the end of the voting period.

Judgement:  FALSE

Explanation: As a noted U.S. Supreme Court Justice (Brennan, I think) commented
             about pornography, "I may not be able to define it, but I know
             it when I see it.", so it is in this case.  TAL's suggestion
             that same form means any proto-proposal at all is totaly specious
             (bovine excrement might be a better term).  Like the good Justice
             I will not attempt to give a complete definition of "being in the
             same form".  I think that the majority of the Players are quite
             capable of recognizing it when they see it.

       I have been told that when a large group of people believe in a
     fantasy, it is called a culture.  When a small group believes, it is
      called a cult.  When two people believe in a fantasy, it is called
	 love; and when one person believes, it is called psychosis.

			 JUDGEMENT OF CFJ 764
	   (Rule 113 can only be interpreted such that...)
======================================================================

  Judgement:  FALSE

  Judge:   Michael

  Eligible to Judge:  Andre, Blob, Coren, Dave Bowen, Chuck, Elde,
		      Jeffrey, Kelly, KoJen, Michael, Pascal, Steve,
		      Swann, Vanyel, Xanadu

  Caller:  TAL

  Scorekeepor:
    Michael receives 3 Points for timely Judgement

----------------------------------------------------------------------

History:
  Called Wed, 12 Apr 95 00:19:28 SET by TAL
  Assigned Wed, 12 Apr 1995 00:50 UTC to Michael
  Judged FALSE Mon, 17 Apr 95 16:22:29 BST by Michael
  --> Michael receives 3 Points

======================================================================

Statement:

"Rule 113 can only be interpreted such that regulation 6 of ElJefe's
`No More Contests' Contest is in conflict with it."

Barred Players: ElJefe

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Rule 113 states: "No penalty worse than deregistration [...] may be
imposed.". Well, Regulation 6 of the NMC Contest imposes *two*
penalties on recidivists. There is:
   Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
   hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
   Points to the Contest Fund.  E may not come Off Hold until
   this Contest is dissolved.
and there is:
   Anyone becoming Contestmaster for the second time via Reg. 5 must
   immediately forfeit the game of Agora Nomic.

Therefore, anyone becoming Contestmaster for the second time looses
all eir Agoran possessions *and* must forfeit.

Obviously, imposing forfeiture *and* confiscation is a penalty worse
than imposing forfeiture alone.

Hence Reg. 6 is in violation of 113 and by 1446 Contestants are not
bound by it.

Consequently the Contestmaster of the NMC Contest, i.e. TAL, is not
bound by Regulation 6.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References (two Rules and the NMC Regulations):

Rule 113/1 (Semimutable, MI=3)
Players May Always Forfeit

      A Player may always deregister from the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player to incur
      it, may be imposed.

Rule 1446/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      score changes and currency transfers taking place under the
      Regulations, administers the Contest Fund, and maintains the
      Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is an entity capable of owning, trading, and
      spending Points or Currencies in the same manner as a Player,
      but only as authorized by the Regulations.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        - how the Contestmaster is replaced,
        - how currencies and Points are transferred to or from the
          Contest Fund,
        - the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, which shall be
          in Points,
        - additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
        - how the Regulations may be changed, and
        - ways for the Contest to be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or as otherwise provided in the
      rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants.

      If according to the Regulations the Contest Fund must transfer
      Points and/or currency to a Contestant, and the Fund does not
      have sufficient resources, then enough of the Contestmaster's
      Points and/or currency are transferred to the Fund to cover the
      transaction.

      If e does not have sufficient Points or currency to accomplish
      this, then each Contestant is given back eir entry fee, and the
      Contestmaster loses the number of Points of the returned entry
      fees. The Contest is then dissolved.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

      This transfer is not taxable.  This Rule takes precedence over
      all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
      transfers are legal and/or taxable, or which would assign Blots
      to any Player.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      ANNOUNCEMENT OF CONTEST
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This announcement creates a contest, named "No More Contests", whose
Regulations are as follows:

  Reg. 1:  The contestmaster is elJefe.

  Reg. 2:  Immediately after this Contest is created, elJefe is replaced
           as Contestmaster by Troublemaker at Large.

  Reg. 3:  The Contestmaster may not create any Contests. E must, if
           possible, dissolve any other Contest in which e is Contestmaster.
           E may not transfer any points to or from other Contest Funds.

  Reg. 4:  If the Contestmaster is deregistered or forfeits from Agora
           Nomic, the most recent Contestmaster still registered becomes
           Contestmaster once again.

  Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster.

  Reg. 6:  Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
           hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
           Points to the Contest Fund.  E may not come Off Hold until
           this Contest is dissolved.  Anyone becoming Contestmaster
           for the second time via Reg. 5 must immediately forfeit the
           game of Agora Nomic.

  Reg. 7:  The Contest is dissolved when Player elJefe posts
 	   a message so announcing to the Public Forum.

  Reg. 8:  If the Contest is dissolved, the Contest Fund is
           distributed to the Wanderers Contest Fund.

  Reg. 9:  The Entry fee is 1000 Points.

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

The text of 113 admits a different interpretation from the one
required of it by the statement of the CFJ.  In particular, it admits
the following interpretation:

   113 consists of two sentences. The first states that a player may
   always forfeit rather than suffer a game penalty.  The second
   states that no penalty worse than deregistration may be imposed.
   The statement's error is to take the second sentence in isolation
   from the first. 

   In this Judge's interpretation, it is clear that the second
   sentence of 113 is a consequence of the first; not independent.
   The second sentence is simply reiterating that a Player may choose
   to forfeit, thereby exempting them from the Game penalty.  The
   second sentence is tautologically true, given the first. 

Having demonstrated that there is another interpretation of 113, one
which does not conflict with regulation 6 of ElJefe's `No More
Contests' Contest, I am free to finish my Judgement (note the
unfortunate use of the word "only" in the Statement).  However, I
should like to point out that this matter has been debated before, and
that the interpretation of 113 that the Statement calls for would lead
to a ridiculous situation.

The careful ellipsis of the words "in the judgement of the Player to
incur it" from the Statement conceals the danger inherent in this
interpretation.  If we were to allow the second sentence of 113
independence from the first (in an entirely separate rule perhaps), a
Player could simply claim that any penalty they might be about to
incur was worse than deregistration, and thereby avoid it entirely
(with the backing of an MI=3 Rule no less).

Game custom and common sense make it clear that this interpretation
was never intended by the author of the rule, and so it is clear that
another interpretation (I provide one above) must govern.

======================================================================

Statement:

"Swann violated Rule 1446 by not transfering all his points and
Currencies to the No More Contests Contest Fund and by not going On
Hold within an hour after creating his own revengeful Contest."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

The Contestmaster of a Contest has to obey the Regulations of
that Contest, according to Rule 1446. By creating a Contest with
the name of `Revenge for TAL' in the message with datestamp
  Date: Thu, 6 Apr 1995 04:04:15 -0400
Swann became the Contestmaster of the No More Contests Contest,
according to its Regulation 5:
  Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster.

But Regulation 6 stipulates:
  Reg. 6:  Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
           hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
           Points to the Contest Fund.

As Swann did not made this transfer, nor went On Hold, he is violating
Rule 1446, that states that Regulations must be obeyed by Contest
masters.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge, if e agrees with my Statement, issues
Injunctions to the effect that
1) Swann's Formal Apology includes 10 Prescribed Words.
 I propose the following ten words:
 I, shall, not, create, Contests, before, reading, all, my, mail

2) the illegal Moves of *not* going On Hold and *not* transfering all
currencies to the NMC Contest Fund are retracted; and that the
Game State is adjusted such that
- Swann is On Hold
- he holds no points and no currencies
- said points and currencies are held by the NMC Contest Fund

----------------------------------------------------------------------

References (Rule 665, 908, 1446;
            the message to the Forum creating the Revenge for TAL
             Contest;
            the regulations of the NMC Contest)

Rule 665/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.


Rule 908/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Call for Judgement alleges that a Player (herein called the
      Ninny) has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE,
      then the Ninny must submit to the Public Forum a Formal Apology
      within 72 hours of the publication of Judgement, unless that
      Judgement is successfully appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      con-taining all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      ex-plaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

      The Player who called the initial CFJ has the duty to report to
      the Tabulator any Blots gained through this rule.

Rule 1446/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      score changes and currency transfers taking place under the
      Regulations, administers the Contest Fund, and maintains the
      Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is an entity capable of owning, trading, and
      spending Points or Currencies in the same manner as a Player,
      but only as authorized by the Regulations.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        - how the Contestmaster is replaced,
        - how currencies and Points are transferred to or from the
          Contest Fund,
        - the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, which shall be
          in Points,
        - additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
        - how the Regulations may be changed, and
        - ways for the Contest to be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or as otherwise provided in the
      rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants.

      If according to the Regulations the Contest Fund must transfer
      Points and/or currency to a Contestant, and the Fund does not
      have sufficient resources, then enough of the Contestmaster's
      Points and/or currency are transferred to the Fund to cover the
      transaction.

      If e does not have sufficient Points or currency to accomplish
      this, then each Contestant is given back eir entry fee, and the
      Contestmaster loses the number of Points of the returned entry
      fees. The Contest is then dissolved.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

      This transfer is not taxable.  This Rule takes precedence over
      all other Rules which determine which Point and Currency
      transfers are legal and/or taxable, or which would assign Blots
      to any Player.

Nice, this may work.  If it does, I propose the following contest:

Revenge for TAL:

1) The Contestmaster of this contest is TAL
2) All points and Currencies owned by the Contestmaster are
   immediatly transfered to the Contest Fund.
3) All points and Currencies recieved by the Contestmaster
   are immediatly transfered into the Contest Fund.
4) These regulations cannot be changed.
5) The Contestmaster may not Change
6) No one may win this Contest

Take that.

Greetings,
TAL

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

Arguments:

In order to determine the truth or falsity of TAL's Statement, we must
determine the Truth or Falsity of the following specific points:

1) The No More Contests Contest (NMC) was a legal Contest via Rule
1446.

2) That the NMC Regulations can, via Rule 1446, require a Player to 
involuntarily become Contestmaster of NMC and legally force that 
Player, via Rule 1446, to transfer all eir points and Currencies to the 
NMC Contest Fund and force that Player to go On Hold.

3) That a violation of Contest Regulations is a Violation of Rule 1446.

4) That my posting crated a valid legal Contest, via rule 1446.

5) That a Contest Creation via point 4) invoked the particular 
Regulations of the NMC referred to in point 2)

6) That my failure to transfer Points, Currencies or and On Hold was a 
violation of the NMC Regulations, and via point 4) a violation of Rule 
1446.

All six items must be valid and true in order for TAL's Statement to be 
true.  I will address each in turn before rendering a Judgement.

Point 1)

Rule 1446/0 states:

"A Contest is created when a Player Posts to the Public Forum an 
announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations."

NMC fulfills this requirement, it was posted to the Public Forum with a 
Name and a list of Regulations, therefore it was legally Created.


Point 2)

>From the NMC Regs:
" Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster.
  
  Reg. 6:  Anyone becoming Contestmaster via Reg. 5 must within one
           hour both go On Hold, and transfer all eir currencies and
           Points to the Contest Fund.  E may not come Off Hold until
           this Contest is dissolved.  Anyone becoming Contestmaster
           for the second time via Reg. 5 must immediately forfeit the
           game of Agora Nomic."

This is more problematic.  First, can a Contest force a Player to 
become a Contestmaster?  Apparently so, since there is no provision 
within 1446/0, or elsewhere in the rules to prevent it.

Next in order of events, can the regulations of that Contest then force 
a Player to go On Hold?

>From 1446/0:

     "The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules."

Does requiring someone to go on Hold conflict with the Rules?  It 
doesn't seem to conflict with 1016/2, which only forbids a Player from 
putting someone other than eimself on Hold.  So far, so good.

Now that the Player is on Hold, can e transfer currencies and/or points 
to the NMC Contest fund as required?  Well, Rule 692/2 says nothing 
preventing a Player On Hold from Trading Points.  And Rule 614/1 
likewise only refers to Players, not Active Players.  Thus these events 
can be mandated, in the order in which they are mandated.


There is, however, an interesting wrinkle to this:

>From 1016/2:

     "While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players."

Note that this rule absolves the Player on Hold from *all duties* once 
e goes on Hold.  This *includes* the duty of Contestmaster.  Therefore, 
the Contestmaster referred to in Reg 6 of NMC Regs has ceased to be 
Contestmaster by the time the first comma is reached.  The one 
immediate side effect of this is the fact that once the Contestmaster 
goes On Hold, as required, the NMC Regs cease to be binding, since e is 
no longer the Contestmaster.

Side Effect one: E can come off of Hold immediately, since the 
restriction about remaining on Hold until the Contest is dissolved is 
non-binding on someone who is not the Contestmaster.

Side Effect two: The Contestmaster must be immediately replaced to 
fulfill the balance of Reg 6 (the Point and Currency Transfer) *or* 
Rule 1446/0 mandates the dissolution of a Contestmasterless Contest.

Can the Contestmaster be replaced?  Unfortunately, no.  The NMC Regs 
only provide explicitly for a Contestmaster forfeiting, or 
deregistering.  So, once Reg 6 is invoked, the NMC contest ceases to 
exist once the Contestmaster goes on Hold.  Because of the order of 
events, the point/currency transfer need not take place as mandated.  
If the Contestmaster Goes on Hold first, as written, the requirement 
ceases to be operative.


Point 3)

Again From 1446/0:

     "The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules."

A violation of the Regs is a violation of 1446/0, provided the Regs do 
not violate the Rules.


Point 4)

Rule 1446/0 states:

     "A Contest is created when a Player Posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations."

My post contained a name, "Revenge for TAL" (RFT) and a list of 
regulations, and was posted in the Public Forum.  However, it contained 
the conditional phrasing:

"Nice, this may work.  If it does, I propose the following contest:"

This is referring to TAL's "Make another Contestmaster" (MAC) Contest.  
However, the goal of the MAC contest was to transfer 90% of the Points 
from the Player with the highest score to TAL.  This did not work.  So 
the condition of this phrase was not met.

Was this conditional phrasing legal?

Unfortunately, (for me) I think not.  According to the wording, a 
Contest becomes a Contest when the announcement appears.  This 
announcement appeared long before the "work/not work" question was 
answered definitively.  Since the conditional phrase was not part of 
the RFT Regs, it had no effect once the Contest was formed.


Point 5)

I legally created the RFT Contest by posting my message.

>From the NMC Regs:

 "Reg. 5:  In case any player legally creates a Contest, that player
           replaces the current Contestmaster, and becomes the new
           Contestmaster."

TAL was then the Contestmaster of NMC, thus I replaced TAL and TAL 
Ceased being the Contestmaster of NMC.

>From the RFT Regs:

"1) The Contestmaster of this contest is TAL."

Upon my becoming Contestmaster of NMC, TAL became Contestmaster of RFT.


Point 6)

TAL's Statement:

"Swann violated Rule 1446 by not transferring all his points and
Currencies to the No More Contests Contest Fund and by not going On
Hold within an hour after creating his own revengeful Contest."

Now I am supposed to judge the truth or falsity of this statement.
According to my reasoningthus far, I could have satisfied the rules 
simply by going on Hold and dissolving the NMC contest.  But this 
statement explicitly states that my violation was in not doing *both* 
the transfer *and* going On Hold.  Not only that, but the wording of 
this Statement is in precisely the opposite order of that required in 
NMC Reg 6.

I must therefore come to an implicit Point 7)

Is it *possible* for me to Judge this Statement TRUE?

The fact is, if I judge this statement TRUE, I am to issue an
Injunction that I am on Hold, and have been since an hour after I
became the Contestmaster of NMC. If I issue that Injunction,  I am on
Hold and I am ineligible to issue that Injunction.  If I am ineligible 
to issue that Injunction, that Injunction has no effect, I am not on 
Hold.  If I am not on Hold, I am mandated to issue that Injunction.

It is impossible, due to this logical paradox, for me to issue a 
Judgement of TRUE.

UNDECIDABLE is reserved for paradoxical Statements, not paradoxical 
Judgements.

There is simply not enough ambiguity in this Statement, or in the Rules, for me 
to Judge UNKNOWN.

After weighing each possible Judgement available to me, and bending over 
backwards to avoid even an appearance of bias in my own favor, I am only left 
with one possible decision, FALSE.  In the end, this Judgement is based on a 
strict reading of the unconditional nature of the Statement, not necessarily in 
the intended argument.

Rule 1016/2 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Putting Oneself on Hold

      A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
      a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may not
      place any other Player besides emself on Hold.  A Player may
      cease to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the
      Public Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e
      last went On Hold.

      While On Hold, a Player may not Vote, propose Proposals,
      or campaign for or hold Office.  E is also absolved of any
      duties which would otherwise be required of eim, including
      appointment as a Judge

      This rule takes precedence over any rule giving special duties
      to a particular player or a particular group of players.

Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points to any other Player for
      any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient has more
           than than 90% of the Points required to Win, or would pass
           this limit as a result of the transfer.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have

      Points.

Legal Judgements

      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE, or

      statements which are logically neither TRUE nor FALSE.  The
      Judgement of UNKNOWN is for those statements for which the
      Judge is unable to obtain information necessary to determine
      whether the statement is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judge must make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      information necessary to determine whether the statement
      is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE.

      The Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments,
      which include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely
      invalid.

      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself.
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and
      arguments along with the Judgement.

      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of
      the Courts.

Statement: 

"The Rules should be interpreted, such that Proposal 1577 contains
zero Rule Changes and zero Directives."

Barred: Andre

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

At first glance, Proposal 1577 seems to contain a Directive to
Change the Category of a Rule.  But it does not; by Rule 1054,
such a Directive must state the old category of the Rule, which
Proposal 1577 does not do.  (As an aside, I note that Promotor
Coren *correctly* assigned Proposal 1577 an AI of 1, rather than
the AI of 2 it would have if it contained a Directive to change
the category of a Rule.)

References:

II.  Rule 1054.

======I. Proposal 1577

Rule 1054/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Changing the Category of a Rule

      The assigned Category of an existing Rule may be changed by
      means of a Directive to change the Category of that Rule.  Such
      a Directive shall clearly state the Rule whose Category is to be
      changed, its old Category, and its proposed new Category.  The
      Proposal containing such a Directive must have an Adoption Index
      of at least 2.

======================================================================

Judgement:  TRUE

As to the first part of the Statement, Proposal 1577 does not even
allege that it contains any Rule Changes, and it would be ludicrous for
anyone to argue that it does.  (Which leaves the Judge wondering why this
needs to be part of the Statement, it is akin to a Statement saying,
"Proposal 1577 was Proposed by Andre and contains zero Directives.")

As to the part of the Statement I am Judging:

   "... Proposal 1577 contains [...] zero Directives."

>From Proposal 1577:

   "Change the Category of Rule 478. The new Category should be 'The
    Distributor and the Assistant'."

>From Rule 1054/1 (Changing the Category of a Rule):

   "Such a Directive shall clearly state the Rule whose Category is to
    be changed, its old Category, and its proposed new Category."

Obviously, Proposal 1577 clearly states the Rule whose Category was to
be changed, and its proposed new Category.  It does not, however, state
the old Category of the Rule.  Therefore, this text, which alleges to be
a Directive, is not a legally formed Directive as defined by the Rules. 
It is, I believe, accepted Judicial practice to assume that there is no
such thing as a Directive not defined by the Rules-- there are only
Directives and non-Directives.  The text in Proposal 1577 is the latter,
and therefore the Statement is TRUE.

The Promotor was correct in assigning this Proposal any AI e deemed
appropriate, since there is no set AI for a Proposal containing random text
(other than it must be at least AI=1.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

Andre is said to have had a Salary of 8 points. However Rule 1040 clearly
states he has a Salary of 5 points. Rule 1007 defers to it. In my opinion
if 'XXX shall receive a Salary of 5 points' takes precedence over 'XXX shall
receive a Salary of 3 points' the resulting Salary should be 5 points, not 3.
For Kelly it's more or less the same, this time Rule 889 being the sole
responsible for eir salary.
Rule 910 states that Steve, as Justiciar, should not receive a Salary. This
Rule takes precedence over Rule 1007 which says e should.

       I have been told that when a large group of people believe in a
     fantasy, it is called a culture.  When a small group believes, it is
      called a cult.  When two people believe in a fantasy, it is called
         love; and when one person believes, it is called psychosis.

      All salaries shall be paid at the beginning of each Nomic week,
      on condition that the Officer has been in Office for at least

Judgement:  FALSE

The CFJ claims an error in the Scorekeepor's report of April 24, following
denial by the Scorekeepor of the associated Claim of Error. The claim is 
that the salaries received by Kelly, Andre and Steve are too high.

Rule 1007/0 states that "Officers ... shall receive a salary of 3 Points 
per week, unless another rule explicitly states another salary." Rules 889/0,
902/0, and 1040/0 award salaries of 5 Points to the CotC, Scorekeepor, and 
Banker, respectively. Rule 910/2 states that the Justiciar shall receive no 
weekly salary. Rule 1070/2 gives the Ambassador 2 Points per week as salary. 

The score report shows Kelly receiving 5 Points as CotC, 5 Points as 
Scorekeepor, and 2 Points as Ambassador, Andre receiving 3 Points as
Herald and 5 Points as Banker, and Steve receiving 5 Points as Assessor;
all these are reported as being awarded on 24 Apr 1995 at 00:00 GMT.

The argument is that the salaries should not amalgamate, but be treated
as a conflict in the definition of "salary" and that only one salary 
should be awarded, to be determined by the conflict resolution rules.

This is a little like saying that nobody should get F-A points because
Rule 312 (each player who Voted gets 1 Point at the end of the Voting 
Period) takes precedence over Rule 833 (when the voting period is over,
the proposer gets F-A points).  In fact, there is no conflict; both awards
can take place and do not interfere with each other.

Or, similarly, the claim that because the Voting Periods for a set of 
Proposals all refer to the same time span, voters get 1 Point regardless 
of how many proposals were voted upon.  This was disposed of in a recent
Claim of Error.

The use of the word "salary" indicates compensation for duties performed.
Its clear meaning is that the points received are tied to the Office held.
Each Office is associated with a separate salary, even if several are held 
by the same Player, just as each Proposal is associated with a separate 
Voting Period, even several share the same time span.

Rule 1007/0 does not clearly state that holders of multiple Offices receive 
multiple salaries, but it does not state the contrary either. The 
interpretation of the Scorekeepor, that they shall so receive them, is in 
accordance with Game Custom and common sense.  Thus Kelly's and Andre's
salaries, as reported, are clearly consistent with the Rules.

The statement in Rule 910/2 is rather interesting; it states that the 
Justiciar shall receive no salary.  If this is taken as actually forbidding
the player to receive Officer salaries, then (A.) it conflicts with
Rule 1007/0 paragraph 2, and (B.) does not explicitly state another salary 
than the default 3 Points.  Rule 910/2 claims precedence in such conflicts, 
and therefore Steve's salaries should total 8 Points.

On the other hand, if the interpretation is that it simply makes the
Justiciar salary 0 Points, then there is no conflict either with Rule 910/2 
or with the awarding of the Assessor salary.  This is the interpretation
I would endorse.  But in any case, it is not true that Steve's salary
is too high, as claimed.

======================================================================

Statement: 

The Move of the Vizier of Reform Group transferring Coins in 
response to the purchase request made by TAL in his message dated 
Thu, 13 Apr 95 17:37:33 SET, is illegal.

Barred: Kelly, TAL

Requested Injunction:

If this CFJ is judged TRUE, I request that the Judge issue an Injunction
specifying that the transfer be retracted and that the most recent
representation to TAL of his Reform Group Coin holding be adjusted to
reflect the retraction of this transfer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

The relevant section of the Reform Group Ordinances in effect at the
time of the Move in question is Ordinance 16.  This Ordinance contains
the sentence "The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the
Group from the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
Exchange, plus the current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is not a
current member of Reform," which clearly specifies that members of
Reform, such as TAL, may not purchase Coins of the Group from the Group
in exchange for Points.  The Vizier of Reform Group is required to not
honor this purchase request by Rule 721, which requires eim to obey the
Ordinances of the Group of which e is a member.

Note that an injunction to correct the report of Coin holdings is
allowed, since that report is a "publication of game state" regardless
of it not being a report of an Officer or being reported to all Players.

Why, thank you.
This seems to be a classic case of the threat being worse than the
execution.

Dear Scorekeepor,
now that ElJefe dissolved the NMC:
please register the transfer of 10.1 points from the MAC Contestfund
to TAL. Signed: the MAC Contestmaster.

Dear Scorekeepor,
please transfer all TAL's points to the Reform Treasury in exchange
for the corresponding number of Reform Coins.
Signed: TAL

Reform Group Ordinances   (March 13, 1995)
Last Ordinance changed: 16

0.
      The Purpose of this Group is to facilitate progressive change
      and dynamic growth within the Game of Agora Nomic, while also
      striving to insure the continuity and playability of the same.

1.
      In all matters which require the Consent of the Membership, the
      Vizier shall announce the Matter in the Group's Public Forum,
      and all Members shall indicate their opinion to the Vizier as
      soon as reasonably possible.  Consent of the Membership is
      defined as at least two-thirds of the Members in favor of the
      matter at hand.  The matter shall not be resolved until either
      seven days have passed from the Vizier's announcement, or
      matters are such that no possible response from those Members
      who have not yet responded could result in a change in the
      consensus opinion.  If, after seven days, less than two-thirds
      of the Membership has responded at all, the consensus shall be
      that the Membership is silently opposed.

2.
      The Ordinances shall have the power to bind the Active Members
      of the Group to cast their individual Votes on Proposals in a
      manner determined by the Ordinances.  In the event that the
      Ordinances do bind the Membership to Vote upon a Proposal in a
      specified way, no Member may cast a Vote on that Proposal which
      is not in concord with this binding; however, a Member may
      always choose to not Vote upon a given Proposal.

3.
      On each Proposal distributed by the Speaker, the Vizier shall
      seek to determine the consensus opinion of the Group of how the
      Membership of the Group shall vote.  Each Member may express
      exactly one of the options specified below, or may indicate that
      e has no opinion; if any of these options is favored by at least
      two-thirds of those Members expressing an opinion, the
      Membership shall be bound by the terms of that option, provided
      that at least two-thirds of the Membership has responded at all
      prior to the end of the Voting Period for that Proposal.  If no
      consensus of opinion is reached by the time that 24 hours remain
      of the Voting Period of a Proposal, then the Membership shall be
      free to Vote as they are individually inclined on that Proposal.

      The options are:
      * to vote FOR the Proposal;
      * to Vote AGAINST the Proposal;
      * to ABSTAIN on the Proposal;
      * to allow the Members to vote however they please on that
        Proposal (UNBOUND);
      * to direct the Vizier to solicit bids from the Electorate at
        large for the privilege of designating the manner in which the
        Group Members shall be bound to Vote (SOLD).

      When the consensus opinion of the Group on a specific Proposal
      is to offer the Group's Votes up for sale, the Vizier shall post
      an announcement to all Active Players advising them that the
      Membership of the Group offers its votes on that Proposal to the
      Player who bids the largest number of the Coin of the Group for
      that privilege.  Members of the Reform Group may not enter bids
      in the sale of the Group's votes, nor may any Player who has
      been a Member of the Reform Group during the 7 days previous to
      the time the auction is announced.  The Vizier shall then accept
      bids until 48 hours prior to the end of the Voting Period on
      that Proposal.  The Vizier shall, at that time, notify the
      highest bidder, if there is one, that e has won the auction.  If
      that Player, before the end of the Voting Period on that
      Proposal, both transfers eir bid, in the Coin of the Group, to
      the Group Treasury, and also specifies to the Membership how e
      wishes it to Vote, the Membership shall be bound to Vote in the
      manner specified by that Player.  Otherwise the Membership shall
      be free to Vote however they please.

      Any time Coins of the Group are transferred to the Group
      treasury as a result of this Ordinance, one half of those Coins,
      rounded up, shall be distributed as evenly as possible among the
      active members of the Group; the remainder, along with any
      fraction unable to be evenly distributed, shall be destroyed.

4.
      The Vizier may expend Points or Currencies held in the Group's
      Treasury for any purpose, but only as specified in the
      Ordinances or with the Consent of the Membership.

5.
      New Members may be admitted to the Group with the consent of the
      Membership.  The Name of a New Member shall be added to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

6.
      An existing Member may be expelled from the Group with the
      consent of the Membership.  For the purpose of determining the
      Consent of the Membership in a matter of expulsion, the Member
      being considered for expulsion shall have no voice.

7.
      Whenever a Member leaves the Group for any reason, eir name
      shall be removed from the List of Members.

8.
      A Member may, at any time, request that eir name be moved to the
      bottom of the List of Members.

9.
      The Vizier may, at any time, nominate another Member as eir
      nominated successor, who shall become Vizier in the event of a
      vacancy, and may retract any such nomination at any time.  All
      such nominations and retractions shall be made to the Group's
      Public Forum.

10.
      The Vizier may resign as Vizier at any time, with or without
      leaving the Group.  Should the Vizier resign without nominating
      a successor, e shall be expelled from the Group.

11.
      In the event that the Group might otherwise have no Vizier, the
      Vizier's nominated successor shall become Vizier.  If there is
      no nominated successor, or the nominated successor is
      ineligible, the first Member on the List of Members shall become
      Vizier.  If there is no such Member, the Group shall be
      dissolved.

12.
      The Vizier shall, in addition to eir other duties, maintain a
      record of the nominated successors to all Group Offices, and
      maintain the List of Members in the order required by these
      Ordinances, and make this information available to any Member
      upon request.

13.
      The Vizier shall, at all times, be the Ordinancekeepor.

14.
      These Ordinances may be changed only with the consent of the
      Membership.  No change in the Ordinances can have a retroactive
      effect, nor cause any action already performed by a member of
      the Group to become void or illegal under the Ordinances or the
      Rules.

15.
      The Vizier may create or destroy Coins of the Group at any time
      for any purpose, but only as specified in the Ordinances or with
      the Consent of the Membership.

16.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the Group
      from the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange, plus the current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is
      not a current member of Reform.  A Player who wishes to purchase
      Coins may do so by transferring a sufficient number of Points to
      the Group Treasury.  When the Scorekeepor has confirmed the
      Point Transfer, the Vizier shall transfer the appropriate number
      of Coins to that Player, creating Coins if necessary.

      The current Reform Service Fee is equal to 5% of the
      transaction, not to be less than 1 Coin, or to exceed 50 Coins.

17.
      The Vizier shall permit Players to sell Coins of the Group back
      to the Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of
      Exchange.  A Player who wishes to sell Coins back to the Group
      may do so by transferring the Coins e wishes to sell to the
      Group Treasury.  The Vizier shall then transfer the appropriate
      number of Points from the Group Treasury to that Player.  The
      transferred Coins shall then be destroyed.

18.
      The Rate of Exchange for Coins of the Group shall be the ratio
      between the number of Coins of the Group in existence (less
      those held in the Group's Treasury) and the number of Points
      held in the Group's Treasury.  This ratio determines the number
      of Coins received in exchange for one Point, or the number of
      Coins needed to receive one Point.

19.
      A Member who leaves the Group for any reason shall not receive
      any share of the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury.

20.
      In the event of the dissolution of the Group, the Treasury shall
      be divided amongst the holders of the Coins of the Group, in
      proportion to the number of Coins held by each Player or other
      Entity.  Coins held by the Treasury are not to be considered in
      this distribution.

========== III. Rule 721

Rule 721/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Ordinances, and Defaults

      All Members of a Group must obey the Ordinances of that Group at
      all times, so long as the Ordinances do not conflict with the
      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

======================================================================

Judgement:  FALSE

	The only problem I had in judging this was whether to judge it 
false, or unknown.  Arguments for judging it unknown are - That I have no 
gurantee to the validity of the Reform Group Ords submitted with this 
call for judgement, and that Reform does not (and is not required to) 
keep any form of records of coin transactions.  I have, however, decided 
to accept the reform group ords as being true - I think the players of 
Agora can be trusted to the extent that at least _one_ member of reform 
would have informed me otherwise.

	I have therefore decided to judge this CFJ FALSE because
	- the exact wording of the ordinance which JonRock objected to is 
"The Vizier shall permit Players to purchase Coins of the Group from the 
Group, in exchange for Points at the current Rate of Exchange, plus the 
current Reform Service Fee, if that Player is not a current member of 
Reform."

	I don't believe the meaning of this is as clear as JonRock claims 
it is and feel it has two, equally acceptable meanings.  One meaning 
would be that Members of Reform may not purchase coins, the other is that 
members of Reform are not required to pay the Reform Service Fee.  
Therefore, by allowing the transfer but not charging TAL a Service Fee 
(which Kelly tells me is what happened), Kelly and TAL were following the 
Reform ordinances, abeit, a slightly different interpretation of them 
from JonRocks.

	Reform ordinances were followed - therefore, the move was not 
illegal and this CFJ is False.

======================================================================

  Judgement:  UNDECIDABLE

  Assigned Fri, 9 Jun 1995 00:00 UTC to Michael
  Judged UNDECIDABLE Tue, 13 JUN 1995 09:43 BST by Michael

======================================================================

Statement: 

Rule 1466 should be interpreted such that a Proposal containing
one or more Currency Directives, and no other Directives or
Rule Changes which would require the Proposal to have a Mutability
Index greater than 1, has a Mutability Index of 1.

Requested Injunction:

I also request that the Judge make an Injunction on the interpetation
of Rule 1466, as described in Rule 789.  (Even though this request
is not necessary for the Judge to make the Injunction.)

Relevant Rules: 1466, 594, 993

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arguments:

My statement is a bit long, but this, I feel, is necessary.  Essentially,
it says that the presence of a Currency Directive in and of itself
in a Proposal does not require that Proposal to have an AI greater
than 1.

Rule 1466 states that "These Directives [Currency Directives] have
an Adoption Index of 2."  An Adoption Index of a Directive is
essentially meaningless, as no other Rule makes any reference to
the AI of a Directive.

Rule 594 sets the Adoption Index of Proposals, but is mainly
concerned with Rule Changes.  It merely defers to other Rules
which set a higher AI for certain Proposals.  1466 is *not*
such a Rule, as it says nothing about the AI of any Proposals,
only the AI of certain Directives.

Rule 993, defining Directives, states, "The Adoption Index of a Proposal
containing a Directive must be at least as great as that required
by the Rule or Rules which define the type of Directive contained
in the Proposal."  Rule 1466 makes *no* requirements about the
AI of any Proposal.  Furthermore, both Rule 993 and Game Custom
make clear that even if a Proposal contains only a single Directive,
the Proposal is not the same as the Directive.

Thus, there is no Rule which would require a Proposal of the sort
defined in my statement (i.e. with one or more Currency Directives,
and possibly other Directives and Rule Changes that do not require
the Proposal to have an AI greater than 1) to have an AI greater
than 1.  Thus, by Rule 594, such a Proposal has an AI of 1.

Currency Directives

      There is a type of Directive, called a Currency Directive.
      These Directives have an Adoption Index of 2. If adopted, they
      have the effect of specifying the Currency holdings contained
      in an Entity or Entities' Treasury or Treasuries. They may have
      no other effects.

Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

======3. Rule 993

Rule 993/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

======================================================================

Judgement: 

UNDECIDABLE

Argument: 

This is really unfortunate, but a mistake in the phrasing of this CFJ
has meant that the obvious intent of the statement has been completely
neutralised.  The ruleset does not discuss whether or not Proposals
have Mutability Indices.  It is clear that rules do (see 1021), but
the interesting Index attached to Proposals is Adoption Index.  The
submitted argument accompanying the statement makes it clear that this
was the intention.  I urge the caller of this CFJ to correct their
mistake, and resubmit. 

The rules do not say that Proposals don't have an MI, but if they do
we can't know anything about them..

  Re-assigned to Chuck, Jun 22 1995, 10:50 UTC
  Judged TRUE by Chuck, Jun 28 1995, 01:24 -0500 (CDT)

#######################################################################

Statement:

"By the Rules, Swann could not assume the office of Tabulator while
 also performing the duties of Herald.  Since Swann did not resign the
 Heraldship, Swann did not assume the Office of Tabulator.  The Office
 of Tabulator is therefore vacant, and has been since the resignation
 of the previous Tabulator."

#######################################################################

Argument:

Frankly, this is so blatantly obvious that I am embarrassed that I  
offered to take the office.  However, that embarrassment is somewhat
moderated by the fact that I seem to be the first person to notice 
the current wording Rule 1436, to wit:

     "Let there be the Office of Tabulator.  A vacant Office of
      Tabulator is filled in the usual manner, but the Scorekeepor or
      Herald may not become Tabulator, nor may the Tabulator become
      Scorekeepor or Herald."

Since I was Herald, I couldn't legally accept the Office when I said I
did, and my Tabulator's Reports were therefore unofficial and legally
void.

As to what this did, if anything, to Kelly's Blot erasure and the
subsequent end of the Game, will await a further CFJ.

======================================================================

Judgement:

I Judge this Statement to be TRUE.


Reasons and Arguments:

The facts of this case are not in dispute:

--On May 19, Pascal was Tabulator and Swann was Herald.
--On May 20, Pascal sent a message to the Public Forum in which
  he resigned the office of Tabulator, attempting to transfer it
  to Swann.  Shortly thereafter, Swann posted a message acknowledging
  his willingness to serve as Tabulator.

At first, Rule 1436 seems to prohibit this; it says "...the Scorekeepor
or Herald may not become Tabulator."  But we must also consider
Rule 880.  It says, "if at the time e resigns e appoints a successor, then
the designated successor, if consenting, will fill the Office."  If
it turns out that Pascal *did* appoint a successor, then Rule 880
takes precedence over 1436, and Swann did fill the Office of
Tabulator in spite of 1436.

Thus, the question hangs on whether Pascal's attempt to name
Swann as successor was in fact appointing a successor.  There
are two possible interpretations:

1.  Pascal's message does qualify as "appointing a successor,"
and 880 takes precedence over 1436, and Swann fills the Office
of Tabulator.

2.  Pascal's message, due to Rule 1436, does not qualify as appointing
a successor, and thus there is no conflict--no successor was
appointed.

I can find no strong, convincing argument in favor of either.  As
far as I know, no similar situation has every arisen and thus Game
Custom is silent.  Nor, IMO, does "the Spirit of the Game" speak
on this issue.  Thus, I must use my own judgement.

It seems to me that the most natural interpretation of "appointing
a successor" is "naming someone eligible to serve in that Office."
Thus, since by Rule 1436, Swann could not succeed Pascal in the Office of
Tabulator while he still held the Office of Herald, Pascal's
message does *not* constitute appointing a successor.

Appointing a successor is not a prerequisite for resignation of
an Office; so although Pascal's message was invalid as far as
appointing a successor goes, it is still valid regarding his
resignation.  Thus, Pascal resigned the Office of Tabulator on
May 20, leaving no successor, and the Office has been vacant ever since.

Rule 1436/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Tabulator

      Let there be the Office of Tabulator.  A vacant Office of
      Tabulator is filled in the usual manner, but the Scorekeepor or
      Herald may not become Tabulator, nor may the Tabulator become
      Scorekeepor or Herald."

      The Tabulator is the Officer responsible for keeping track of
      the Blots possessed by each Player, as well as all ex-Players
      who have Blots.  The Tabulator may have other duties as defined
      in the Rules.

      Once a Week The Tabulator shall post to the Public Forum a
      report of the Blots held by each Player.  If a Player has earned
      Blots since the last report, this report must publicize the
      reason for the gain in Blots.

      The Tabulator's salary shall be four Points per Week.

      If any Rule mandates a change in Blots, but does not also
      specifically state the Player who is Legally Responsible for
      detecting the change and reporting it to the Tabulator, then the
      change in Blots is canceled.

      If a Blot change is not reported within four Weeks of its
      occurrence, or by the end of the Game in which it occurred,
      whichever is sooner, the change in Blots is cancelled.

Rule 880/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer may resign eir Office at any time either by a message
      to the Public Forum, or by going On Hold, or as otherwise
      specified in the Rules.

      When an Officer resigns eir Office, e ceases to fill that
      Office.  If an Officer resigns during the Voting Period for a
      Proposal containing a Directive to install another player in
      that Office, then the Player thus proposed, if consenting, will
      fill the Office.

      Otherwise, if at the time e resigns e appoints a successor, then
      the designated successor, if consenting, will fill the Office.
      If there is no appointed or proposed successor, or if e does not
      consent to fill the Office, then the Office becomes vacant.

      No player who is "On Hold" may fill an Office.  If an Officer
      goes On Hold then e automatically resigns all eir Offices.

  Changes due to this CFJ:
  * Chuck looses 2 points for declining, one of which goes to Andre.
  * Kelly's move of Winning the Game is retracted
  * All players have eir scores reset to what they were prior to the
    mistaken end of the game
  * Ian gains 5 points, and looses 2 Blots, or the number of Blots he

  * TAL gains 3 points for timely Judgement

Remark of CotC:
  I haven't checked the Rules yet on whether TAL's step of giving 3
  different Judgements is legal. However, in my opinion, even if it is
  illegal it is still the Judgement he gave, so I am obliged as CotC
  to distribute it this way.

#######################################################################

Statement:

"Swann was not Tabulator when Kelly spent 5 points to erase a Blot,
 so Swann could not legally remove Kelly's Blot.  The Speaker was not
 acting in the Tabulator's capacity at this time, so the Blot was not
 erased, and Kelly has not yet won the game."

######################################################################

Arguments:

I mistakenly accepted the Tabulatorship when it wasn't legally possible
for me to do so.  (First paragraph of 1436 and my prior CFJ)  This means
that, for the past three weeks or so, the office of Tabulator has been
vacant.

Now, Rule 806/1 mandates that the Speaker performs the duties of vacant
Offices.  However, this does not change the fact that, because everyone
assumed my Tabulatorship to be valid, that the Speaker *did not* perform
those duties while the Office was vacant.  The Speaker did not produce
the Tabulator reports, and, more importantly, the Speaker-- who by law
was the only person who was able to-- did not record any changes in the
status of Blots in the game.

This disctinction is important because of the explicit wording of Rule
1440/0:

     "If there are sufficient Points, the Scorekeepor reduces the
      Player's Points by the required amount and the Tabulator reduces
      the Player's Blots as requested."

The phrase here is unambiguious--  "the Tabulator reduces the Player's
Blots" -- This rule states clearly that it is the person acting in the
Office of Tabulator who reduces the Blots.  The Blot is not gone until
the Tabulator acts, confirming the message.

Therefore, Kelly's Blot erasure cannot happen until someone who is able
to legally act as Tabulator confirms the erasure and publishes a legally
valid Tabulator report.

Since Blots prevent a Player from winning the game, (Rule 1435/0) Kelly
has not yet won the game, nor has the game yet ended.

########################################################################

Requested Injunction:

That Kelly's move of Winning the Game is retracted, and all players have
their scores reset to what they were prior to the mistaken end of the game.

########################################################################

Argument of Judge:

The arguments provided by Swann regarding this CFJ are clear precise and leave
little room for argument.  

First, Swann took on the position of Tabulator, which was an illegal move by 
Rule 1436/1.  

Now, 1436/1 also says that "The Tabulator is the Officer responsible for
keeping track of the Blots possessed by each Player, as well as all ex-Players
who have Blots.  The Tabulator may have other duties as defined in the rules." 
Note that it does not say that the Tabulator is the one adding or removing
Blots from Players, only that e keeps track of Players' Blots.  But it also
says that e may have other duties.

Other Rules that state that a Player Gains or Loses Blot(s) state just that. 
For example, Rule 452/4 states (in part) "If a Call for Judgment alleging a 
violation of this rule is found to be TRUE, the Assessor violating this rule 
shall gain three (3) Blots. Reporting this gain to the Tabulator is the 
responsibility of the Player who called the CFJ."  In this Rule, "the Assessor
... shall gain 3 Blots".  No doubt about it.

Now on to the particulars.

Rule 1440/0 says (in part) that "If there are sufficient Points, the
Scorekeepor reduces the Player's Points by the required amount and the
Tabulator reduces the Player's Blots as requested."  It is the Tabulator 
eirself that is reducing the Blots.  Since the Office was vacant, this could 
not have taken place.

Any other Blot Gains or Losses during Swann's "reign" would have to be examined
to determine whether or not they happened or not.  However, I have no
jurisdiction over those.

I may only uphold Swann's Injuction:
   "Kelly's move of Winning the Game is retracted, and all players have eir
   scores reset to what they were prior to the mistaken end of the game."

I would like to point out, though, that Rule 665/0, which describes Injunctions
to Retract an Illegal Move, doesn't allow me to take away the Points that Swann
earned as Tabulator. I would recommend that this be fixed.

####################################################################

Judgement of Speaker:

I hereby overturn Ian's Ruling and find this CFJ FALSE.

I concur that Swann was, in fact, not Tabulator on 3 June, when Kelly
erased eir Blot.  Also, I concur that Swann had no power on that date
to erase any of Kelly's Blots, as that power is only granted to Kelly,
per Rule 1440/0.  The statement implies a causal connection which is
not present, but nonetheless the first statement in the Statement is
true.

However, the second statement is not true.  First, we do not know if
the Speaker was acting in the Tabulator's capacity; all we can tell
from the evidence before us is that the Speaker was not diligently
performing the duties required of him by Rule 806/1.  He may have been
acting in the Tabulator's capacity in a haphazard and negligent way.

however, the claim that Kelly's Blot was not erased is FALSE.  it is
here that this CFJ falls down.  Rule 1440 is internally inconsistent;
it claims alternatively that a Player can erase eir own Blots, and
then later claims that only the Tabulator can do so.  Since the Rules
are unresolvably inconsistent, I am instructed by Rule 217/0 to
consider Game Custom and the Spirit of the Game in determining my
Judgement.  In almost every case, Officers do not effect changes in
Game Quantities; they merely record them.  Since the first paragraph
of 1440/0 is consistent with this Custom, it is my belief that the
instructions to the Scorekeepor and Tabulator in the fourth paragraph
of 1440/0 are merely instructing the Scorekeepor and Tabulator to
perform their bookkeeping duties of recognizing the events which took
place upon the action of the Player as dictated by the first and
second paragraphs of the Rule.  Since Kelly did perform all the
actions required of her by these two paragraphs, it is my ruling that
she did, in fact, Erase her one remaining Blot on 3 June.

Since Kelly was Immaculate on 12 June when she acquired a total of 214
Points, 4 more than she needed to win, she did legally win the game on
that date.  Hence, both the second and third clauses of the second
statement in the Statement are FALSE; therefore, the second statement
is FALSE, and therefore the entire Statement itself is FALSE.

I recommend and, should my fellow Justices concur, order, that Judge
Ian's Injunction be vacated.

Submitted this 16th day of June, 1995,

Kelly Martin
Justice of the Appellate Court of Agora Nomic

########################################################################

Argument of CotC:

I overturn the judge, and find the statement UNKNOWN

The important point in this CFJ lies, of course, in Rule 1440. At least, as far
as I can tell noone denies the fact that at the time Kelly tried to erase her
Blot the Speaker served as acting Tabulator.
The question is: Who erases the Blots according to this Rule and when?
The caller claims that the phrase
"If there are sufficient Points, the Scorekeepor reduces the
Player's Points by the required amount, and the Tabulator reduces
the Player's Blots as requested."
implies that it is the Tabulator who does so.
The Judge agreed with him, and as there was no Tabulator at the time, claimed
this could not have happened. Before I go to the main thread of my Judgement,
I will first show another error in this line of reasoning.

There WAS a Tabulator at the time Kelly tried to make her transfer. As Rule
806 shows, the Speaker (which was me at the time) should fulfill all duties
of an Office which is vacant. Therefore if Claimant and Judge are right the
Speaker (that is me) should have removed the Blot. Did I? Well, I don't know.
It depends on what one defines to be the act of removing. However, it is NOT
in the act of publishing a Blot report. Therefore the absence of Blot Reports
does NOT imply that the Blot has not been removed. So there is, even in this
case, no evidence that would support a Judgement of 'TRUE'. The Judgement
should have been 'UNKNOWN'. There are even factors that could imply that I
had removed the Blot. At the very least my actions afterwards imply I regarded
the Blot as having been erased.

However, there is more.
Rule 1440 consists of more lines than the quoted ones.
It starts with saying:
"A Player may Erase eir Blots by spending five Points for each
Blot Erased. A Player may Erase any number of Blots as long as e
does not reduce eir Point total below zero.  A Player with less
than five Points may not Erase Blots."

So according to this Paragraph it is the PLAYER who erased the Blots. And that
is independent of whether or not there is a Tabulator, or who it is. However,
the Rule goes on:

"The Player Erasing Blots must report to the Tabulator and the
Scorekeepor the number of Blots e is Erasing, and the Points
required to do so."

Kelly sent a message to nomic-business with the following text:

"i hereby expend five points to erase one blot.

as scorekeepor i assert that i have five points to expend."

I hereby ascertain that I (at that time acting Tabulator) received this
message. I also have no reason to doubt that Kelly herself did receive it.
So still there is no problem. On with the following Paragraph.

"If this requires more Points than the Player has at the time of
the request, then no Blots are erased, and no Points are lost."

As far as I know Kelly had the number of Points needed, being 5.

Now the Paragraph which caused the troubles appears:
"If there are sufficient Points, the Scorekeepor reduces the
Player's Points by the required amount and the Tabulator reduces
the Player's Blots as requested."

Here indeed it says it is the Tabulator reduces the Player's
number of Blots. As notified before this makes Rule 1440 have an internal
contradiction.

We here have a case where the Rules are inconsistent or unclear. So now
it is time to put 217 in the Picture. I should now apply Game Custom and
the Spirit of the Game. I regard them both quite silent on the matter, 
however. So I am allowed to apply other standards. And I think judging it
to be the Player who reduces the number of Blots and the number of Points,
is the one that comes closest to the Rule 1440 as it is.

However, the difference is small and so there is something else I will take
into account: I think it is a good thing to, as a Justice, follow the Judge
if the differences are this small. We are here (partly) to judge the Judge's
decision, which with differences this small is perfectly sensible, although
it wouldn't have been mine.

So the situation is such:
1440 has 2 interpretations, namely one where the Player who erases the Blots
lowers the number of Blots, and one where it is the Tabulator who does so.

If I had been judge myself I would have judged FALSE as I favor the first
opinion, however I am willing to follow the Judge in stating the second one,
thus still arriving to 'UNKNOWN' instead of 'TRUE'.

Andre Engels,
CotC in the Court of Appeal of Agora Nomic.

======================================================================

Argument of pro-Justiciar (part 1):

Note that nothing in the Rules forbids me to issue more than one
Judgment. Here is number 1:

Judgment: TRUE

Arguments:
I take the liberty to cut immediately to the heart of the matter, the
interpretation of 1440.

At first sight, it seems that the Blot Erasing Rule 1440 is
contradictory. It says:
"A Player may Erase eir Blots ..."
and
"...the Tabulator reduces the Player's Blots as requested."

The first phrase states that it is the Player's Move that
accomplishes the Erasure (Kelly's view) and the second that it is
the Tabulator who does the Disappearing act (Swann's view).

However, I prefer the viewpoint that erasing a Blot requires
at present two actions:
- the 5 point payment by the Player
- the subsequent check of the possibility of this payment followed
by the Blot destruction of the (acting) Tabulator.

This means that this Rule does it differently than most other
`recordkeeping' Rules, where the Officers are merely bookkeepers of
other Players actions. While this might be undesirable in my view,
it is not a priori excluded that such a Rule exist.

The next question to answer is therefore: was somebody doing the
duties of Tabulator?
We all agree by now that Swann was not Tabulator on June 3, as 1436
forbids this.
Therefore the duties fall to the Speaker (Rule 806).
Hence within a week after June 3 a Tabulator's report should have
appeared, posted by Speaker Andre, mentioning the Blot Erasure.

No such report did.

Hence, the conclusion of the statement, that the Blot was not erased
and that Kelly did not win the Game are true, as well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Judgement of pro-Justiciar, part 2:

Note that nothing in the Rules forbids me to issue more than one
Judgment. Here is number 2:

Judgment: FALSE

Arguments:
Let's first parse the statement:
1) Swann was not Tabulator when Kelly spent 5 points to erase a Blot.
2) Swann could not legally remove Kelly's Blot.
3) The Speaker was not acting in the Tabulator's capacity at this time
4) the Blot was not erased
5) Kelly has not yet won the game

All of these five parts have to be TRUE for the statement to be
TRUE. I think that by now we all agree that 1) is TRUE.

I'll skip 2) for the moment.
3) is rather interesting. I suppose we agree that Andre was *not*
doing the duties of Tabulator: he issued no reports, for instance.
However, 806 gives him another legal possibilty:
"The Speaker may delegate [the duties of a vacant Office] to a willing
 Player if e desires."

This statement is there without any further precision on how this
transfer of duties takes place. Is it via a posting? Not necessarily.
In the case at hand it seems to have been by mutual and silent
consent: for all practical purposes Swann was doing the duties
of Tabulator and Andre wasn't.

(Side note: nothing forbids the Herald to perform the duties of
Tabulator. 1436 forbids only that both Offices are combined in the
same Player.)

We therefore have to conclude that Swann *was* indeed doing the duties
of Tabulator.

This brings us to the most interesting part:
can and did Swann legally remove Kelly's Blot? It comes down to
the question whether the Tabulator (or its delegate in this case)
is a passive recordkeepor of the Blots erased or that the erasure
requires an active Move of eir part.

At first sight, it seems to me that the Blot Erasing Rule 1440 is
contradictory. It says:
"A Player may Erase eir Blots ..."
and
"...the Tabulator reduces the Player's Blots as requested."

The first phrase states that it is the Player's Move that
accomplishes the Erasure (Kelly's view) and the second that it is
the Tabulator who does the Disappearing act (Swann's view).

However, I prefer the viewpoint that erasing a Blot requires
at present two actions:
- the 5 point payment by the Player
- the subsequent check of the possibility of this payment followed
by the Blot destruction of the (acting) Tabulator.

As I established that Swann was acting Tabulator and as Kelly
made the 5 Point payment, I conclude that 2) is TRUE.

Consequently 4) the Blot was not erased is a FALSE statement,
making the whole statement FALSE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Judgement of pro-Justiciar, part 3:

Note that nothing in the Rules forbids me to issue more than one
Judgment. Here is number 3:

Judgment: UNDECIDABLE

Arguments:
It seems to me that the Blot Erasing Rule 1440 is contradictory.
It says:
"A Player may Erase eir Blots ..."
and
"...the Tabulator reduces the Player's Blots as requested."

The first phrase states that it is the Player's Move that
accomplishes the Erasure (Kelly's view) and the second that it is
the Tabulator who does the Disappearing act (Swann's view).

If Swann's view prevails then it is obvious that the Blot was never
erased, because the Speaker (the acting Tabulator at the time)
didn't do anything of that nature.

Hence the contradiction in 1440 leads directly to the logical
undecidability of the statement, that the Blot was erased.

      Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Blots, shall be

Rule 1436/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Tabulator

      Let there be the Office of Tabulator.  A vacant Office of
      Tabulator is filled in the usual manner, but the Scorekeepor or
      Herald may not become Tabulator, nor may the Tabulator become
      Scorekeepor or Herald."

      The Tabulator is the Officer responsible for keeping track of
      the Blots possessed by each Player, as well as all ex-Players
      who have Blots.  The Tabulator may have other duties as defined
      in the Rules.

      Once a Week The Tabulator shall post to the Public Forum a

      Blots since the last report, this report must publicize the
      reason for the gain in Blots.

      The Tabulator's salary shall be four Points per Week.

      If any Rule mandates a change in Blots, but does not also
      specifically state the Player who is Legally Responsible for
      detecting the change and reporting it to the Tabulator, then the
      change in Blots is canceled.

      If a Blot change is not reported within four Weeks of its
      occurrence, or by the end of the Game in which it occurred,
      whichever is sooner, the change in Blots is cancelled.

Rule 1440/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Erasing Blots

      A Player may Erase eir Blots by spending five Points for each
      Blot Erased. A Player may Erase any number of Blots as long as e
      does not reduce eir Point total below zero.  A Player with less
      than five Points may not Erase Blots.

      The Player Erasing Blots must report to the Tabulator and the
      Scorekeepor the number of Blots e is Erasing, and the Points
      required to do so.

      If this requires more Points than the Player has at the time of
      the request, then no Blots are erased, and no Points are lost.

      If there are sufficient Points, the Scorekeepor reduces the
      Player's Points by the required amount and the Tabulator reduces
      the Player's Blots as requested.

      Other rules may define additional methods of Erasing Blots.

History: 
	Called by Kelly, Jun 15 1995, 12:35 EST
	Assigned to Dave Bowen, Jun 16 1995, 10:01 UTC 
	Judged FALSE by Dave Bowen, Jun 16 1995, 12:12 UTC

======================================================================

Statement:

"Player Swann committed an illegal act by submitting the CFJ 711."

======================================================================

Requested Injunction:

I request that if this CFJ is found TRUE that Swann be ordered to
submit a Formal Apology in accordance with Rule 908/3.

======================================================================

Argument:

The Statement of Swann's CFJ, in part, alleges that the Published Game
State is incorrect, in that it alleges that Kelly has not yet won the
Game.  However, a CFJ which alleges that the Game State is incorrect
may only be made if a prior Claim of Error has been made and either
denied or ignored.  Since this has not happened, Swann's act of making
this CFJ was in violation of Rule 1431/1.

======================================================================

Decision: FALSE

======================================================================

Reasoning: CFJ 711 was not submitted by Swann. (see attachment)

======================================================================

Evidence:

I. Rule 1431/1
II. Statement of CFJ 771

-------I.

Rule 1431/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Claims of Error

      If a Player, hereafter called the Claimant, believes any
      official report or document to contain an error, e shall post to
      the Public Forum a statement that e believes the report to be in
      error, specifying the nature of the error, and requesting the
      Player responsible for the document, hereafter called the
      Respondant, to correct the error.  The Respondant shall
      immediately investigate the claim of error, and, as soon as
      possible after the posting of the claim, either admit the claim
      and issue an official correction to the document, or deny the
      claim.  Such admission or denial shall be posted to the Public
      Forum.

      If and only if the Respondant does not admit the claim, the
      Claimant may, within one week of the posted denial (or the
      expiration of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's
      response), make a Call for Judgement alleging the document to be
      in error.

      If the Respondant does not admit the claim and a subsequent Call
      for Judgement finds that the claim is true, the Respondant shall
      lose 5 points.  The Claimant is responsible for reporting this
      score change when it occurs.  There is no penalty under this
      Rule if the Respondant admits the claim and corrects the error
      without a Call for Judgement having been made.

      A claim is illegal and may not be made if:
        a) another claim has previously been made alleging the same
           error, unless this prior claim was not admitted and the
           time limit to make a CFJ has expired;
        b) the document containing the error was published more than
           21 days prior to the claim; or
        c) the Player making the claim is the same as the Player
           responsible for the document alleged to be in error.
        d) the report in error has been superceded by another report.
      
      For the purpose of this Rule, an "offical report or document" is
      any report or document which an Officer (or the Speaker) is
      required to maintain by the Rules in the course of eir duties as
      that Officer (or as Speaker), and an "error" is the omission or
      inclusion of any information which causes the official report or
      document to allege that the Game State is in any way different
      than it actually is.

      No Call for Judgement may be made alleging that a document
      contains errors except as prescribed in this Rule.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might allow a
      Call for Judgement prohibited by this Rule to be made, or which
      might prohibit a Call for Judgement permitted by the Rule from
      being made.

########################################################################

Arguments:

Yet another obvious point that needs to be made, to wit, Kelly's message to the 
Public Forum, Tue, 13 Jun 95 02:37:56 EST5, and I quote:

   "with Andre's consent, i hereby transfer the Office
    of Clerk of the Courts to him."

The only conditional in this sentence is that Andre consent to the transfer of 
the Office.

I quote Andre's message to the Public Forum:

   "I hereby publicly confirm my consent."

Therefore, from Rule 880/1:

     "An Officer may resign eir Office at any time either by a message
      to the Public Forum, or by going On Hold, or as otherwise
      specified in the Rules.

      When an Officer resigns eir Office, e ceases to fill that
      Office."

Therefore, when Kelly posted the message to the Public Form, stating eir
(implicit) resignation, Kelly ceased to be Clerk of Courts.  Any other legal
controversy surrounding the End of the Game, or the transition of
Speaker, does not apply here.  Andre may, or may not, be Clerk-- but the
Rules are unambiguous on the point that Kelly is *not* the Clerk.

#####################################################################

Reasoning of Judge:

Decision: TRUE

Reasoning: Kelly posted her resignation as Clerk of the Courts, conditional
   on Andre's consent, to the Public Forum.  Andre posted his consent to the
   Public Forum.  Thus, the requirements for resignation of office, as specified
   in Rule 880/1, were met and the office of Clerk of the Courts was transferred
   from Kelly to Andre.  Since there has been no succeeding transfer of this
   office back to Kelly, Kelly is not the Clerk of the Courts at the time this
   CFJ was submitted.

Rule 880/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer may resign eir Office at any time either by a message
      to the Public Forum, or by going On Hold, or as otherwise
      specified in the Rules.

      When an Officer resigns eir Office, e ceases to fill that
      Office.  If an Officer resigns during the Voting Period for a
      Proposal containing a Directive to install another player in
      that Office, then the Player thus proposed, if consenting, will
      fill the Office.

      Otherwise, if at the time e resigns e appoints a successor, then
      the designated successor, if consenting, will fill the Office.
      If there is no appointed or proposed successor, or if e does not
      consent to fill the Office, then the Office becomes vacant.

      No player who is "On Hold" may fill an Office.  If an Officer
      goes On Hold then e automatically resigns all eir Offices.

######################################################################

History:

	Called by Swann, June 18 1995, 11:33 MET
	Assigned to Zefram, June 18 1995, 12:48 UTC
	Judged FALSE by Zefram, June 22 1995, 08:53 +0100 (BST)

######################################################################

Statement:

"The Clerk of the Courts violated Rule 1431/1 by distributing CFJ 772,
 CFJ 722, and the Appeal of CFJ 771. (This statement makes no allegation
 concerning the validity of these documents.)"

######################################################################

Arguments:

On Thu, 15 Jun 95 12:17:36 Kelly posted a COE to the Public Forum:

  "I claim that the Clerk of the Courts erred, in claiming that the
   document issued as CFJ 771 is actually a legal CFJ."

As far as I can determine, the current CotC has yet to respond to
affirm or deny any of the COEs pending against the Clerk's Office.

However, rule 1431/1 mandates:

     "The Respondant shall immediately investigate the claim of error,
      and, as soon as possible after the posting of the claim, either
      admit the claim and issue an official correction to the document,
      or deny the claim."

And rule 1023/2 defines "as soon as possible" as:

     "within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform."

The Clerk's distribution of statements to be Judged is an action
e is required to perform (Rule 991/0):

     "The Clerk of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be
      judged, along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players."

The CotC distributed the first CFJ 772 on Fri, 16 Jun 95 11:07:41
METDST, *after* Kelly's COE, but *before* responding to it.  Therefore
the CotC is in violation of Rule 1431/1.

This is not trivial.  If the Clerk, for instance, admits Kelly's Claim
then every subsequent CFJ needs to be renumbered.  Considering the
volume of recent CFJs, a delay in addressing any of the COEs-- two
of which allege that distributed CFJs are not legitimate-- will cause
needless legal confusion.

Note: This CFJ, if found TRUE, will not deprive any other CFJ of its
legal force.  To quote 1023/2:

     "This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have."

By extension, the Clerk's violation of the "as soon as possible"
clause of 1431/1 does not deprive the distributed CFJs and Appeals
of the effects they would have had the Clerk observed the Rule.

Further note:  The violation of "as soon as possible" incurs a
penalty of 10 points (Rule 1023/2) and of 1 Blot (Rule 1439/0) if
this is found TRUE, Tabulator take note.

######################################################################

Decision: FALSE

######################################################################

Reasoning and Comments:

For the second time this week, a CFJ has failed due to a typo in the
statement.  I will first discuss what would have happened to this
judgment if the statement had instead been "The Clerk of the Courts
violated Rule 1431/1 by distributing CFJ 772, CFJ 772, and the Appeal
of CFJ 771. (This statement makes no allegation concerning the validity
of these documents.)", assuming that the two "CFJ 772"s refer to the
two CFJs given the number 772, the second of which should have been CFJ
773.

In that case, Swann's argument (above) would be entirely correct. Kelly
did post a legal Claim of Error to the Public Forum, requiring Andre
(the Clerk of the Courts) to respond "as soon as possible".  Andre
subsequently distributed two CFJ 772s, and the appeal of CFJ 771, as
the rules require.  He therefore neglected to respond to the COE as
soon as possible, in violation of 1431/1.  Thus such a CFJ would be
judged TRUE.

The actual statement in CFJ 775 contained a reference to CFJ 722.  The
salient points concerning CFJ 722 are: (a) its posting was not in
violation of rule 1431/1; and (b) it was posted on 15th November 1994,
when Vanyel was the CotC.  Therefore in order for the (correct)
argument given in CFJ 775 to be relevant to the statement, it is
necessary for it to be decided that: (a) the statement does not state
that *each* of the required posts violated rule 1431/1, but merely that
*the three combined* violated rule 1431/1; and (b) the words "the Clerk
of the Courts" in the statement refer to *whoever held the office at
the appropriate time*, rather than to *the current Clerk of the
Courts*, namely Andre.

To explain the above: as the posting of CFJ 722 did not violate rule
1431/1, then an interpretation of the statement that it states that
*each* of the posts violated rule 1431/1 would make the statement
FALSE.  However, if the statement meant that "distributing CFJ 772, CFJ
722, and the Appeal of CFJ 771" should be taken as a single action
(gramatically), then it is clear that this action did violate rule
1431/1, making that part of the statement TRUE.

If the words "the Clerk of the Courts" are taken to refer to Andre
specifically, then the statement is FALSE because Andre did not
distribute CFJ 722.  That is, unless he made some unrecorded and
otherwise legally insignificant distribution of CFJ 722, that I cannot
confirm.  If "the Clerk of the Courts" is taken to mean the official
position, rather than Andre, then it is TRUE that the Clerk of the
Courts distributed CFJ 722, as well as the other CFJs mentioned.

Note that the creation date of rule 1431/1 is not at all relevant to
the question of whether CFJ 722 violated it.  It is simply the case
that to have done so would not be illegal, and hence that allegation
alone would not be sufficient basis for a legal CFJ under rule 662/1.
However, the other parts of the statement, regardless of
interpretation, do clearly allege that certain Moves were illegal.

On the two interpretation matters, I rule as follows:  the matter of
whether the statement treats "distributing CFJ 772, CFJ 722, and the
Appeal of CFJ 771" as a single action I judge to be FALSE, after
enquiring of the Caller which meaning he had intended.  Whether "the
Clerk of the Courts" refers to the position rather than the incumbent
at the time of the CFJ, I judge TRUE, because rule 889/1 (Clerk of the
Courts) clearly states "there shall exist an Office "Clerk of the
Courts"...".

Hence I must judge FALSE, on the grounds that distribution of CFJ 722
did not violate rule 1431/1.

References & Evidence:

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1023/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action 
      "as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action 
      within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform.  Failure to observe these time
      requirements shall result at a minimum in the incursion of a 10
      point penalty; other Rules may impose further penalties.
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Invoking Judgement

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      No Player shall submit more than five CFJ's per week.
      (*Was: 407*)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1431/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Claims of Error

      If a Player, hereafter called the Claimant, believes any
      official report or document to contain an error, e shall post to
      the Public Forum a statement that e believes the report to be in
      error, specifying the nature of the error, and requesting the
      Player responsible for the document, hereafter called the
      Respondant, to correct the error.  The Respondant shall
      immediately investigate the claim of error, and, as soon as
      possible after the posting of the claim, either admit the claim
      and issue an official correction to the document, or deny the
      claim.  Such admission or denial shall be posted to the Public
      Forum.

      If and only if the Respondant does not admit the claim, the
      Claimant may, within one week of the posted denial (or the
      expiration of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's
      response), make a Call for Judgement alleging the document to be
      in error.

      If the Respondant does not admit the claim and a subsequent Call
      for Judgement finds that the claim is true, the Respondant shall
      lose 5 points.  The Claimant is responsible for reporting this
      score change when it occurs.  There is no penalty under this
      Rule if the Respondant admits the claim and corrects the error
      without a Call for Judgement having been made.

      A claim is illegal and may not be made if:
        a) another claim has previously been made alleging the same
           error, unless this prior claim was not admitted and the
           time limit to make a CFJ has expired;
        b) the document containing the error was published more than
           21 days prior to the claim; or
        c) the Player making the claim is the same as the Player
           responsible for the document alleged to be in error.
        d) the report in error has been superceded by another report.
      
      For the purpose of this Rule, an "offical report or document" is
      any report or document which an Officer (or the Speaker) is
      required to maintain by the Rules in the course of eir duties as
      that Officer (or as Speaker), and an "error" is the omission or
      inclusion of any information which causes the official report or
      document to allege that the Game State is in any way different
      than it actually is.

      No Call for Judgement may be made alleging that a document
      contains errors except as prescribed in this Rule.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might allow a
      Call for Judgement prohibited by this Rule to be made, or which
      might prohibit a Call for Judgement permitted by the Rule from
      being made.

Rule 1439/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgment (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Mutability Index of the violated
      Rule rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if
      its Mutability Index exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the
      wording of the violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in
      the specific case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot
      penalties in the case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Tabulator.

Additional References & Evidence:

-----------------------------------------------------------

Rule 662/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Allowed CFJ's

      A "Move" refers to any specific action taken by a Player or
      group of Players in the context of the game. Any invocation of
      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege, either implicitly or explicitly, that the
            Rules generally ought to be interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for
      Judgement by the Clerk of the Courts. However, this Rule shall
      defer to rules which explictly permit CFJs that do not
      necessarily meet the above conditions.

  Assigned to Vanyel Jun 21 1995, 08:22 UTC
  Assignment upheld Jun 21 1995, 09:37 UTC
  Judged FALSE by Vanyel, Jun 23 1995, 09:53 -0500 (CDT)

=======================================================================

Statement:

"KoJen failed in eir legal duty as Promotor, by failing to distribute
 legally submitted Proposals from JonRock, Steve, Swann and Andre.  Eir
 Promotor's Report of 20th June 1995 was therefore in error, in that it
 did not list valid Proposals that e had received."

======================================================================

Arguments:

On 20th June 1995, KoJen posted an official Promotor's Report to the
Public Forum.  In it e claimed to have received nine Proposals, but
claimed that none were valid Proposals due to the fact that none of
them contained both a Rule Change and a Directive.

Rules 594/1 and 993/1 do not require proposals to contain either Rule
Changes or Directives.  KoJen's interpretation is entirely wrong.  At
least some of the nine proposals e received are valid, and under rule
1036/2 e is therefore legally required to officially distribute them.

This argument hinges upon the unclear wording of rules 594/1 and
993/1.  I claim that the normal English interpretation of the words "a
Proposal may contain one or more ..." in that context would be "a
Proposal may, optionally, contain one or more ..." rather than "a
Proposal must contain one or more ...".  I arrive at this
interpretation, in part, because the words are part of rules that
*describes* certain aspects of Proposals, rather than being a
definitive *definition* of a Proposal.

========================================================================

Requested Injunction:

That KoJen's Promotor's Report of 20th June be retracted, and that
KoJen submit a corrected Promotor's Report, and that rules 594/1 and
993/1 be annotated in accordance with rule 789/1.

========================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasoning:

I began to gather evidence on this CFJ, when suddenly I realized that it
didn't matter whether KoJen was holding back Proposals (which is my
personal belief), as none of the "Proposals" seem to have been sent in
before 13 June.  Therefore, his Promotor's Report was not, I regret to
say, in error.  I can't even call the ASAP Rule into evidence, as the
Promotor's Report of 20 Jun was not anything required of em, but rather
more along the lines of "discussion".

Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if

      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

Several Players have been after me to get the Promotor's Report out. I

Submissions have been received from JonRock (4), Steve (3), Swann (1), and

None of these are Proposals. 

By R594, a Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. By R993, a Proposal

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Swann, Jun 21 1995, 02:22 -0400
  Assigned to Steve, Jun 21 1995, 09:18 UTC
  Judged TRUE by Steve, Jun 26 1995, 13:06 +1000 (EST)

======================================================================

Statement:

"The Clerk of the Courts violated Rule 1431/1 by distributing CFJ 772,
 CFJ 772 (subsequently renumbered 773), and the Appeal of CFJ 771. (This
 statement makes no allegation concerning the validity of these documents.)"

####################################################################


Arguments:

On Thu, 15 Jun 95 12:17:36 Kelly posted a COE to the Public Forum:

  "I claim that the Clerk of the Courts erred, in claiming that the
   document issued as CFJ 771 is actually a legal CFJ."

As far as I can determine, the current CotC has yet to respond to
affirm or deny any of the COEs pending against the Clerk's Office.

However, rule 1431/1 mandates:

     "The Respondant shall immediately investigate the claim of error,
      and, as soon as possible after the posting of the claim, either
      admit the claim and issue an official correction to the document,
      or deny the claim."

And rule 1023/2 defines "as soon as possible" as:

     "within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform."

The Clerk's distribution of statements to be Judged is an action
e is required to perform (Rule 991/0):

     "The Clerk of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be
      judged, along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players."

The CotC distributed the first CFJ 772 on Fri, 16 Jun 95 11:07:41
METDST, *after* Kelly's COE, but *before* responding to it.  Therefore
the CotC is in violation of Rule 1431/1.

This is not trivial.  If the Clerk, for instance, admits Kelly's Claim
then every subsequent CFJ needs to be renumbered.  Considering the
volume of recent CFJs, a delay in addressing any of the COEs-- two
of which allege that distributed CFJs are not legitimate-- will cause
needless legal confusion.

Note: This CFJ, if found TRUE, will not deprive any other CFJ of its
legal force.  To quote 1023/2:

     "This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have."

By extension, the Clerk's violation of the "as soon as possible"
clause of 1431/1 does not deprive the distributed CFJs and Appeals
of the effects they would have had the Clerk observed the Rule.

Further note:  The violation of "as soon as possible" incurs a
penalty of 10 points (Rule 1023/2) and of 1 Blot (Rule 1439/0) if
this is found TRUE, Tabulator take note.

######################################################################

Judgement: TRUE

Arguments:

Swann's arguments are clear and his allegations are borne out by the
evidence attached to his CFJ, to wit: that CotC Andre distributed
2 CFJs and a notice of Appeal subsequent to Kelly's having made a
COE, but prior to his having responded to the COE. This contravenes
the partial ordering placed on the actions of the CotC by Rule 1023.

Injunctions:

I therefore issue the following two Injunctions: 

1. Andre is penalized 10 points for his violation of Rule 1023.

The second Injunction is required by Rule 908:

2. Andre must submit a Formal Apology. The list of Prescribed Words
is as follows:

Never in the field of human conflict have so many

Rule 1023/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action 
      "as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action 
      within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform.  Failure to observe these time
      requirements shall result at a minimum in the incursion of a 10
      point penalty; other Rules may impose further penalties.
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.

Rule 991/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Invoking Judgement

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagrement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      No Player shall submit more than five CFJ's per week.
      (*Was: 407*)

----------------------------------------

Rule 1431/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Claims of Error

      If a Player, hereafter called the Claimant, believes any
      official report or document to contain an error, e shall post to
      the Public Forum a statement that e believes the report to be in
      error, specifying the nature of the error, and requesting the
      Player responsible for the document, hereafter called the
      Respondant, to correct the error.  The Respondant shall
      immediately investigate the claim of error, and, as soon as
      possible after the posting of the claim, either admit the claim
      and issue an official correction to the document, or deny the
      claim.  Such admission or denial shall be posted to the Public
      Forum.

      If and only if the Respondant does not admit the claim, the
      Claimant may, within one week of the posted denial (or the
      expiration of any prescribed time limit for the Respondant's
      response), make a Call for Judgement alleging the document to be
      in error.

      If the Respondant does not admit the claim and a subsequent Call
      for Judgement finds that the claim is true, the Respondant shall
      lose 5 points.  The Claimant is responsible for reporting this
      score change when it occurs.  There is no penalty under this
      Rule if the Respondant admits the claim and corrects the error
      without a Call for Judgement having been made.

      A claim is illegal and may not be made if:
        a) another claim has previously been made alleging the same
           error, unless this prior claim was not admitted and the
           time limit to make a CFJ has expired;
        b) the document containing the error was published more than
           21 days prior to the claim; or
        c) the Player making the claim is the same as the Player
           responsible for the document alleged to be in error.
        d) the report in error has been superceded by another report.
      
      For the purpose of this Rule, an "offical report or document" is
      any report or document which an Officer (or the Speaker) is
      required to maintain by the Rules in the course of eir duties as
      that Officer (or as Speaker), and an "error" is the omission or
      inclusion of any information which causes the official report or
      document to allege that the Game State is in any way different
      than it actually is.

      No Call for Judgement may be made alleging that a document
      contains errors except as prescribed in this Rule.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which might allow a
      Call for Judgement prohibited by this Rule to be made, or which
      might prohibit a Call for Judgement permitted by the Rule from
      being made.

Rule 1439/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgment (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Mutability Index of the violated
      Rule rounded down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if
      its Mutability Index exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the
      wording of the violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in
      the specific case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot
      penalties in the case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Tabulator.

Reply-To: nomic-discussion@teleport.com


Several Players have been after me to get the Promotor's Report out. I
apologize for the delay. I have been studying the Rules pertaining to the
duties of the Promotor, and soliciting the valued opinions of our Wisest
Players.

Submissions have een received from JonRock (4), Steve (3), Swann (1), and
Andre (1).

None of these are Proposals.

By R594, a Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes. By R993, a Proposal
may contain one or more Directives. Together, they require a Proposal to
contain at least one Rule Change *and* at least one Directive. None of the
submissions met this requirement.

Clearly, Rules 594 and 993 need to be amended. Watch for a proto, immediately
following this message.

(When I began to study the Rules relating to the Promotor, I neither expected
nor desired this outcome. But I am convinced that no other interpretation is
reasonable. How could we have overlooked this before?)

-- KoJen

-------------------------------------------------------------

Obviously the Promotor is privy to great wisdom not granted to
us mere mortals.  To divine such exclusivity inherent within
two separate rules with conditional clauses requires a great
mind.  I am unable to approach such reasoning myself. . .

I must assume that the lack of Kojen's CFJ on this critical and
fundamental matter within the Ruleset must simply be an oversight
and I see it as my duty as an Agora citizen to petition the
Judiciary to accept such fundamental wisdom.

It is, indeed fundamental.  Look at how far-ranging Kojen's 
perceptive argument reaches:

Rule 1451/0:

"A player may disown their own proposal"

Rule 991/0:

"a Player may invoke Judgement"

Rule 692/3:

"A Player may voluntarily transfer Points"

Rule 1440:

"A Player may Erase eir Blots"


Indeed, there is an intricate web of things that "may" be
done, and it is Kojen's legacy to us to take the scales
off of our eyes, to make us aware that the word "may"
does not imply an option at all, it does in fact bear the
weight of a prescriptive *demand* upon us.  It is our
duty to follow such logic when presented in such a 
lucid, effective, and altogether helpful manner.

{Opinions within this CFJ may not necessarily represent
 those of the Caller.}

======================================================================

Judgement & Reasoning of Judge:

I judge the statement to be FALSE.

My reasoning is as follows:

In the opinion of this Judge, the relevant sentences of both rule 594/1 
and rule 993/1 (those beginning "A Proposal may contain ...") state 
nothing more than "the inclusion of Rule Changes and/or Directives in a 
submission that might otherwise be a Proposal does not preclude said 
submission from being a Proposal."

I thus interpret the rules as meaning that the inclusion of one or more 
Rule Changes and Directives in a Proposal is optional; both, one or 
neither may occur.

I believe that this interpretation of the use of "may" in the ruleset is 
in keeping with Game Custom.

Rule 594/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

Rule 993/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

Rule 1451/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Disowning Proposals

      A player may disown their own proposal if it has not yet been
      distributed or if no more than four days have passed since its 
      distribution, by sending a statement disowning it to the Public 
      Forum.  

      The player so disowning a proposal loses a flat fee of five
      points, reported by the Assessor, but any other score changes,
      blots, or other effects resulting from the player's submission
      of that proposal, including but not limited to formatting
      penalties, rule repeal rewards, new player bonuses, and awards
      or penalties for votes cast on that proposal are cancelled and
      shall not be taken into account.  The disowning Player does not
      receive any Extra Votes for a Proposal he disowned, even if it
      passes. 

      Neither the Assessor nor any Player who has been Assessor since
      the beginning of the voting period on that proposal may disown a
      proposal, unless that proposal has not yet been distributed. 

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which would
      otherwise seek to reward or penalize any player based on the
      disowned proposal.

Rule 991/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Invoking Judgement

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this

      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as

Rule 692/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Trading Points

      A Player may voluntarily transfer Points in eir possession to
      any other Player for any purpose, within the following limits:
       (a) the transfer must be posted to the Public Forum
       (b) a Player may only transfer a positive number of Points
       (c) a Player may not transfer more Points than e currently has
       (d) a Player may not transfer Points if the recipient has more
           than than 90% of the Points required to Win, or would pass
           this limit as a result of the transfer.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

Rule 1440/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Erasing Blots

      A Player may Erase eir Blots by spending five Points for each
      Blot Erased. A Player may Erase any number of Blots as long as e
      does not reduce eir Point total below zero.  A Player with less
      than five Points may not Erase Blots.

      The Player Erasing Blots must report to the Tabulator and the
      Scorekeepor the number of Blots e is Erasing, and the Points
      required to do so.

      If this requires more Points than the Player has at the time of
      the request, then no Blots are erased, and no Points are lost.

      If there are sufficient Points, the Scorekeepor reduces the
      Player's Points by the required amount and the Tabulator reduces
      the Player's Blots as requested.

      Other rules may define additional methods of Erasing Blots.

			JUDGEMENT OF CFJ 779
		("Rule 1466 should be interpreted such that...")

======================================================================

Judgement:	TRUE

Judge:		Michael

Caller:		Chuck

Eligible:	Andre, Dave Bowen, elJefe, Ian, JonRock, Kelly
		KoJen, Michael, Steve, SugarWater, Swann, Tal,
		Vanyel, Xanadu, Zefram

Barred:		none

Not Eligible:	Chuck (caller)
		Blob (1005)
		Coren, Pascal (On Hold & 1005)

Effects of this CFJ:
  Michael receives 5 Points for Speedy Judgement.
  The Scorekeeport is required to annotate 1466 as described in the
   Injunction

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Chuck, June 21 1995, 19:16 +0200
  Assigned to Michael, June 22 1995, 09:58 UTC
  Judged TRUE by Michael, June 23 1995, 10:53 BST
 
======================================================================

Statement:

Rule 1466 should be interpreted such that a Proposal containing
one or more Currency Directives, and no other Directives or
Rule Changes which would require the Proposal to have a Adoption
Index greater than 1, has a Adoption Index of 1.

Relevant Rules: 1466, 594, 993

======================================================================

Requested injunction:

I also request that the Judge make an Injunction on the interpetation
of Rule 1466, as described in Rule 789.  (Even though this request
is not necessary for the Judge to make the Injunction.)

======================================================================

Arguments:

(This is essentially a resubmission of CFJ 769, with an unfortunate
miswording corrected.)

My statement is a bit long, but this, I feel, is necessary.  Essentially,
it says that the presence of a Currency Directive in and of itself
in a Proposal does not require that Proposal to have an AI greater
than 1.

Rule 1466 states that "These Directives [Currency Directives] have
an Adoption Index of 2."  An Adoption Index of a Directive is
essentially meaningless, as no other Rule makes any reference to
the AI of a Directive.

Rule 594 sets the Adoption Index of Proposals, but is mainly
concerned with Rule Changes.  It merely defers to other Rules
which set a higher AI for certain Proposals.  1466 is *not*
such a Rule, as it says nothing about the AI of any Proposals,
only the AI of certain Directives.

Rule 993, defining Directives, states, "The Adoption Index of a Proposal
containing a Directive must be at least as great as that required
by the Rule or Rules which define the type of Directive contained
in the Proposal."  Rule 1466 makes *no* requirements about the
AI of any Proposal.  Furthermore, both Rule 993 and Game Custom
make clear that even if a Proposal contains only a single Directive,
the Proposal is not the same as the Directive.

Thus, there is no Rule which would require a Proposal of the sort
defined in my statement (i.e. with one or more Currency Directives,
and possibly other Directives and Rule Changes that do not require
the Proposal to have an AI greater than 1) to have an AI greater
than 1.  Thus, by Rule 594, such a Proposal has an AI of 1.

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Argument: 

  As the caller points out in their attached argument, rule 1466 fails
  to use the appropriate language to specify an AI for a proposal
  containing a Currency Directive.  Instead, the rule mistakenly
  attempts to define an AI for the directive itself, a meaningless
  concept.

  Examples of the correct way to word specifications of AIs for
  Proposals containing Directives can be found in the 1006/2
  (Directives to install an Officer), 1054/1 (Changing the category of
  a rule), 1052/1 (Creating new rule categories) and 649/1 (Patent
  titles). 

======================================================================

Injunction:
  
  As allowed for by 789, I require the Scorekeepor to annotate rule
  1466 with the Statement above, and the list of relevant rules
  (provided with the CFJ).

Currency Directives

      There is a type of Directive, called a Currency Directive.
      These Directives have an Adoption Index of 2. If adopted, they
      have the effect of specifying the Currency holdings contained
      in an Entity or Entities' Treasury or Treasuries. They may have
      no other effects.

Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

History:
  Called by Steve, Jun 22 1995, 13:06 +1000 (EST)
  Assigned to Zefram, Jun 23 1995, 08:22 UTC
  Judged UNDECIDABLE by Zefram, Jun 23 1995, 12:11 +0100 (BST)

======================================================================

Statement:

That KoJen violated Rule 1023 when he distributed a Proposal numbered
1607, and that he therefore incurs a 10 point penalty under that Rule.

======================================================================

Requested Injunction:

That KoJen be penalized 10 points under Rule 1023, and that he submit
a Formal Apology under Rule 908 for his violation of Rule 1023.

======================================================================

Reasons and Arguments:

Rule 1036 requires the Promotor assign numbers to Proposals "as soon
as possible" after receiving them. Rule 1023 defines "as soon as possible"
to mean "within a week, and no later than any other action which e is
subsequently required to perform". I allege that there were other actions
which the Promotor was required to perform prior to (to be precise, no
later than) his distribution of the Proposal which he numbered 1607,
namely, the numbering of other Proposals which he had received prior
to that one, and after he had received Proposal 1606. If the Judge
believes that there were other such Proposals, then e should (in my
view) Judge the Statement TRUE.

======================================================================

Decision: UNDECIDABLE

======================================================================

Reasoning of judgment:

Steve's argument is largely logically correct, and refers to rules
accurately.  Specifically, if KoJen received any valid Proposals before
he distributed Proposal 1607, then e was required by Rule 1036 (and
1023) to number them before distributing Proposal 1607.  If he received
them before receiving Proposal 1607, then he was required by Rule 1036
(and 1023) to number them before numbering Proposal 1607.

This would seem to indicate that he violated Rule 1023 in the course of
violating Rule 1036, which required him to number such Proposals before
numbering Proposal 1607.  That argument, however, arrives at the
conclusion that he neglected to number these proposals by assuming that
he numbered them in the manner required by Rule 109.  It is not
possible to rule out the possibility that he in fact numbered such
proposals before numbering Proposal 1607, but numbered at least one of
the involved proposals (definitely including the Proposal distributed
as Proposal 1607) incorrectly, and distributed them out of order.  Such
action would violate Rules 109 and 1036, but not 1023 as Proposals are
not required to be distributed As Soon As Possible.

It is noted that had the Statement referred to Rule 1036 instead of
Rule 1023, then it would have had the intended effect of requiring a
determination of whether any Proposals of the type discussed above were
actually submitted.

References and Evidence:

      The Promotor shall give each submitted Proposal a Number for

      have been incorrectly submitted), or 301, whichever is greater.

Rule 1023/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action 
      "as soon as possible", e is required to perform that action 
      within a week, and no later than any other action e is
      subsequently required to perform.  Failure to observe these time
      requirements shall result at a minimum in the incursion of a 10
      point penalty; other Rules may impose further penalties.
      However, activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded
      from the ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its 
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have. 
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be 
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold.

History:
  Called by TAL, June 22 1995, 13:16 SET
  Assigned to Michael, June 23 1995, 09:00 UTC
  Defaulted by Michael, June 30 1995, 09:00 UTC
  Assigned to KoJen, June 30 1995, 15:50 UTC
  Judged FALSE by KoJen, July 6 1995, 15:56 -0400

======================================================================

Statement:

The correct interpretation of Rule 1466 implies that it does not
limit the effect of a Currency Directive on adoption to only one
moment in time.

Requested injunction:

I request that the Judge make an Injunction on the interpetation
of Rule 1466, as described in Rule 789.  (Even though this request
is not necessary for the Judge to make the Injunction.)

======================================================================

Decision & Injunction:

My judgement on CFJ781 is FALSE.

Injunction: Rule 1446 shall be annotated as follows:

    This Rule should be interpeted such that a Currency Directive causes a
    one-time change to a Treasury, in the same manner as in involuntary
    transfer.

======================================================================

Arguments:

According to 1446 a Currency Directive has the
effect of specifying the Currency holdings contained in some
Treasury. However, nowhere in the Rules it is said for how long
the Currency Directive remains effective.

1446 states only "if adopted", which excludes the CD from having
any effect before the adoption of the Proposal containing the CD, but
learns us nothing about the time of application, after adoption.

The generic Rule on Directives 993, doesn't help either. In its first
paragraph it uses exactly the same wording:

"A Directive, if adopted, causes some change in the Game State other
than changing a Rule."

The second paragraph claims:
"If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
 shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal"
which changes the starting moment a little bit, but nothing more.

In fact, none of the other Directives has an effectiveness that is
limited to one specific moment in time.
So why should the Currency Directive?

======================================================================

Reasoning of Judge:

At first, I almost thought that TRUE *might* be a plausible ruling because of
this phrase in Rule 1466:

    If adopted, they have the effect of specifying the Currency holdings
    contained in an Entity or Entities' Treasury or Treasuries.

The word is "specify" rather than "set". "Specify" has connotations which *can*
imply a lasting influence, contrasted with "set" which implies an action at a
specific instant. Note that most other Directives do not create this ambiguity,
because the action caused by most other Directives is described using a verb
which, like "set", clearly implies an action applied at a specific instant.

So Rule 1466, alone among all Directives, is ambiguous as to whether it implies
a continuous effect (in this case, on a Currency, nullifying all other attempts
to change the Currency).

How do we handle this?

Several ways.

1) "Common sense". It is clearly a ludicrous interpretation that a Currency
Directive can serve as a permanent impediment to any change to that Currency,
even as amounts are added and removed to that treasury by voluntary and
involuntary transfers. 

Of course, common sense is used as a last resort in Agora, but I believe it was
used in other recent judgements. (Who said, "if there are two interpretations,
one of which leads to contradictions and ther other of which does not, use the
one which does not"?) I believe that is applicable here.

2) A perhaps more convincing way to solve the ambiguity, and justify the ruling
of FALSE, is in Rule 993 itself. The second paragraph contains the sentence:

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

The defining Rule for Directives clearly explains how to order multiple
Directives which occur in a single Proposal. But if a Directive could cause a
continuous action into the future, then such ordering would be unnecessary, and
would not even make sense. Thus I am forced to conclude that Rule 993 clearly
defines Directives to cause an action to occur at a specific instant in time
only.

      These Directives have an Adoption Index of 2. If adopted, they
      have the effect of specifying the Currency holdings contained
      in an Entity or Entities' Treasury or Treasuries. They may have
      no other effects.

Rule 993/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if
      adopted, causes some change in the Game State other than
      changing a Rule.  No Directive may change any Rule.  Only those
      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

History:
  Called by Steve, Jun 23 1995, 01:24 +1000 (EST)
  Assigned to Dave Bowen, Jun 23 1995, 09:13 UTC
  Judged FALSE by Dave Bowen, Jun 23 1995, 09:19 -0500

======================================================================

Statement:

That the most recent Promotor's Report, in which a Proposal numbered
1607 has been distributed, is in error, in that this Proposal has
been distributed later than other Proposals, not yet distributed by
the Promotor, which were received by him earlier than this Proposal,
and in that this Proposal has been distributed with an incorrect Number. 

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring Promotor KoJen
to distribute a corrected Promotor's Report forthwith, containing
the texts and correct numbers for all the Proposals which has received
since the numbering of Proposal 1606 and prior to the distribution of
the erroneously numbered Proposal 1607.

======================================================================

Reasons and Arguments:

Both the distribution and the numbering are in contravention of Rule 1036.

First the distribution: Rule 1036 requires that the Promotor distribute
numbered Proposals "not later than any subsequently received Proposal".
Hence the Promotor cannot legally distribute the above Proposal unless
and until he has distributed the other Proposals which he has received
prior to this one.

On the numbering: Rule 1036 requires the Promotor to assign Numbers
to Proposals "as soon as possible" after receiving them. From Rule
1023, "as soon as possible" means "within a week, and no later than
any other action which e is subsequently required to perform". Hence
the above Proposal can only be numbered 1607 if the Promotor has not
received any other Proposals since Proposal 1606 was given its
number.  I allege that this is not the case: that the Promotor has
received other Proposals prior to this one, and that one of these
Proposals (in fact, whichever was the earliest received of them) is
the correct deserver of the number 1607.

Naturally, the truth of the CFJ rests entirely on the matter of
whether Promotor KoJen is correct in maintaining that he has in fact
received no texts prior to the one he distributed as Proposal 1607,
which are to be regarded as legally submitted Proposals. This
matter is currently under consideration by another Judge.

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasoning: This judge agrees with Plantiff's claim that the truth of this
           CFJ rests entirely on the question of whether the Promoter has
           in fact received no validly submitted Proposals prior to the
           one he distributed as number 1607. This question is currently
           the issue in another CFJ.  But by submitting this CFJ before
           the other CFJ has been decided, the Plantiff has forced this
           Judge to make his own determination of the facts in this issue.
           The relevant rules are 594/1 and 993/1.  In both of them we find
           the dread word "may".  This word has two generally accepted
           meanings in the English language the first roughly synonymous
           with "is allowed to" and the second roughly synonymous with
           "is required to".  Rejecting those cases where the permissive
           interpretation is assigned to one rule and the restrictive
           interpretation is assigned to the other, we are left with two
           cases to consider.  Under the permissive interpretation, anything
           meeting the other requirements for proposalhood would be a valid
           Proposal.  It would make these rules meaningless.  Thus we
           reject the permissive interpretation.  This leaves us with the
           restrictive interpretaion for both rules and we are forced to agree
           with the Promoter that under the current rules a Proposal must
           contain both a Rule Change and a Directive.  We will accept the
           Promoter's statement that the texts he had received did not meet
           this requirement as the Plantiff has not challenged it in his
           statement of the issues.

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Michael, June 23 1995, 10:29 BST
  Assigned to Vanyel, June 23 1995, 12:22 UTC
  Judged FALSE by Vanyel, June 27 1995, 01:29 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

Statement & Requested Injunction:

Agora's rules (in particular 993/1) are currently such that Proposals
containing Directives can only be adopted if there are no votes
AGAINST the Proposal.

As this is a rule interpretation judgement, I am required by 789/1 to
include a list of relevant rules.  In this case I believe the list to
include 993/1 and 594/1.  If the Judge should find the statement TRUE,
they may choose to an injunction as per 789.

======================================================================

Argument:

594 states:
      The Adoption Index of a Proposal shall be the least Index which
      is not less than the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all the Rule Changes within the Proposal to take effect.  This
      paragraph yields to any Rule which may require a higher Adoption
      Index for a given Proposal.

993 states:
      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be
      at least as great as that required by the Rule or Rules which
      define the type of Directive contained in the Proposal.  Any
      Proposal for which this is not true is not properly made.

Only if there were no AGAINST votes can a Proposal containing
Directives pass.  1274/0 defines an ordering on Indices such that a
Proposal with a Voting Index (see 955/2) of Unanimity automatically
has a greater index than any possible Adoption Index.  Otherwise it is
impossible to determine the Voting Index required to adopt the
Proposal. 

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasoning:
At first I was confused by the argument, but it seems to boil down to
the fact that the Rules seem to provide a lot of lower bounds for AI,
but nothing else.  Yet, by calling in the quoted paragraph of 594, we
see that the AI must be the "minimum...which would allow all the Rule
Changes within the Proposal to take effect."  In the case of a Proposal
with Directives and no Rule Changes, this would be 1, as that is the
minimum AI (1 being the lowest possible AI, also from 594) that would
allow all the Rule Changes therein to take effect (there being none).
Of course, if the Directives require a higher AI, that's fine too--but
they do not absurdly require Unanimity.

  Judged TRUE by SugarWater, July 14 1995, 21:12 -0700 (PDT)

======================================================================

Statement: The first Injunction issued by Judge Steve in CFJ 777 is
illegal.

======================================================================

Argument:

Rule 663/1 only permits a Judge to make those Injunctions which are
specifically authorized in the Rules.  Steve's first Injunction,
"Andre is penalized 10 points for his violation of Rule 1023" is not
of a type permitted by the Rules.  The Rules only authorize three
sorts of Injunction, and the Injunction under question is not one of
these three.

Rule 665/0 permits an Injunction to retract an illegal move and the
consequences thereof; however, this Injunction assessess a penalty
mandated by the Rules, which is not a retraction of a move or an
adjustment resulting from the retraction of said illegal move; if
anything, the penalty is a consequence of the illegal move, and
retracting the Move would also retract the penalty, not enforce it.

Rule 789/1 permits an Injunction to annotate a Rule; clearly this
Injunction does not seek this.

Finally, Rule 908/3 permits a Judge to issue an Injunction which
specifies a list of prescribed Rules which a Ninny must use in a
Formal Apology mandated by that same Rule.  Judge Steve's first
Injunction is not of this sort either.

Since the Injunction in question is not of a form permitted by the
Rules, it is illegal and has no legal force.

======================================================================

Decision & Injunction:

Judgement: TRUE 


Injunction: 

	As per rule 908/3, Player Steve must submit a Formal Apology,
containing the following Prescribed Words:  

chiaroscuro belletrist sabre-rattling curmudgeon angst

======================================================================

Reasoning: 

	It is clear that the injunction in question is neither a Rule
annotation nor a call for Formal Apology, and, therefore, does not fall
under the auspices of rule 789/1 or 908/3. 
	This requires that, for the Injunction to be legal, it must be of
the type described in rule 665/0 -- namely, "specifying that the move is
to be retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the game state". 
	The injunction in question clearly does not mandate the retraction
of a move.  It is, therefore, illegal, and the Caller's statement is TRUE. 

======================================================================

Evidence:

I. Rule 663/1
II. Rule 665/0
III. Rule 789/1
IV. Rule 903/3
V. CFJ 777, incorporated by reference

-------I.

Rule 663/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions--General

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE as
      provided in the rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of
      statements specifying an action or actions which must take
      place. If a Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that
      Injunction must be published with the Judgement. All players
      must abide by the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours
      after its publication unless one of the following conditions
      then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNKNOWN as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

-------II.

Rule 665/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

      If a CFJ alleges that a specific Move is illegal, and the
      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

-------III.

Rule 789/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

-------IV.

Rule 908/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Call for Judgement alleges that a Player (herein called the 
      Ninny) has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in 
      violation of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE,
      then the Ninny must submit to the Public Forum a Formal Apology
      within 72 hours of the publication of Judgement, unless that
      Judgement is successfully appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      con-taining all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      ex-plaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

      The Player who called the initial CFJ has the duty to report to
      the Tabulator any Blots gained through this rule.

==========================================================================
Statement:
  The rules ought to be interpreted in such a way that the submission
  distributed as Proposal 1614 is not a properly made Proposal, and
  should not be voted upon.

==========================================================================
Argument:
  I personally would prefer if the Rules allowed 1614 to be voted 
  upon and not take effect; however, the Rules are not currently 
  written this way, and this is the only way to prevent the Proposal 
  from being effective.

  I am also not specifically claiming the KoJen broke the Rules,
  or that a particular report is in error.  This is just an 
  interpretation CFJ.

  Rule 1003 forbids Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to
  coerce a player into voting against eir conscience.  The commentary
  accompanying the Proposal makes this intent explicit. Such a
  proposal is considered not to be "proposed in the proper way". 
  (Rule 1003)

  Rule 106 only requires a vote for "Proposals made in the proper way."

  Further, Rule 1003 claims precedence over other rules which would 
  otherwise allow such a shameful proposal to be voted upon, such as 
  Rule 683, 957, etc.

  The question arises as to the possible effects on Rule 1003 of its
  infection by the Nomic Virus.  This caused the last two paragraphs to
  read

      ...
      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

  (omitting the meaningless "(*Was: 822*)" designation).

  It is never relevant in Agora Nomic to ask about the author's intent, 
  and it is even less relevant here, if possible, since the "author" of 
  the latest amendment is the Virus.

  Consistent with this stance, I would ask the Judge to ignore the fact 
  that the proposal was partly Virus-generated, and interpret the words 
  as they are written, as if a Player had written the proposal this way.
  This allows us to try to make sense of the Rule as an organic entity.

  There are two ways to interpret the last paragraph: (1.) it contradicts
  the previous paragraph, and cancels its effect;  or (2.) it refers 
  to rules not covered by the penultimate paragraph (mentioning "other 
  Rules" as it does) and therefore leaves 1003's claimed precedence 
  intact.

  It is an ancient rule of legal construction that if there are two 
  possible ways to interpret a rule, the preferred interpretation is
  the one which is not internally contradictory.

  Under (1.), the Rule contradicts itself and would cause the second-
  last paragraph to be meaningless.  This interpretation would give 
  the rule the same effect no matter what precedence claim that 
  paragraph made.

  Under (2.), the penultimate paragraph explicitly give the rule 
  precedence as before.  The last paragraph may now cause it to defer 
  to some rules where it had precedence by virtue of its number, but 
  not where the previous paragraph claims precedence.  In this 
  interpretation, each paragraph of the Rule has meaning.

  Interpretation (2.) should be preferred, Rule 1003 should be held to
  have precedence as it did before infection, and "Proposal 1614" should
  be considered not properly made, and should not be voted upon.

==========================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgment: TRUE

Arguments:
There are four Rules that define when a Proposal is not "properly made"
Let us see whether they apply to `the submission distributed as Proposal
1614' (P1614 for short).

1) Rule 993 states a condition relevant only to Directives. No problem
for P1614.

2) Rule 597 obliges Proposals to be headed by a Title. P1614 has one.

3) Rule 1003 is the Rule upon which both ElJefe and Steve rely when they
argue against or for the legality of P1614.
Its first sentence states:
     "Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed."

This seems very clear to me: P1614's obvious intent is to coerce
Players and 1003 forbids such Proposals explicitly.
Hence P1614 is *not* a Proposal. (Apparently it is a bit of text send
by Steve via the Promotor to the Agora community to amuse everybody.)

The fact that the second and third paragraph are contradictory, does
not modify my argument, as there is no Rule that obliges the Promotor
to do something with non-Proposals. Take for instance 1036: it states
that a *Proposal* shall be numbered and distributed. But P1614 is not
a Proposal.
Or take 404:
     "As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content."
No doubt....but again, not applying to P1614.

(Note: and what if P1614 was a Proposal? Well, I haven't looked at it
in detail, but the logical contradiction in 1003 would make a case
for a legitimate UNDECIDED, if not for 783.)

4) The fourth Rule dealing with "proper" is 783.
The relevant part is:
     "Proposals which contain clauses awarding, trading, penalizing,
      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have
      been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon."

This is clear too. Even if P1614 was a Proposal, the nature of its
threat
     "All and only those Players who did not [...]
      are hereby deregistered as of the Creation of this Rule."

is in violation of Rule 783. After all, upon deregistration, the Point,
Mark, EV and other Currency holdings of these Players are put to zero,
which seems quite penalizing to this Judge.

Therefore my Judgment is TRUE.

A Coercive Proposal (!)

Create a Rule with the following text:

      All and only those Players who did not vote FOR the Proposal
      whose adoption resulted in the Creation of this Rule, and who
      did not vote FOR any Proposal to award the Patent Title of the
      Order of Machiavelli to Player JonRock, are hereby deregistered
      as of the Creation of this Rule. They may not reregister for a
      period of ten days.

      This Rule then automatically repeals itself.

####

Comments:

It is my view that the penalty threatened by the proposal is coercive
within the meaning of Rule 1003. The proposal attempts to coerce Players
to vote FOR JonRock's forthcoming attempt to achieve the Machiavelli Title.
This proposal of JonRock's will be distributed in the next Promotor's
Report. With it will also be my own attempt to have this Title awarded to
myself. I choose to attempt to coerce support for JonRock rather than
myself because I want it to be clear than I am not trying to exploit
the Viral infection of Rule 1003 for personal gain. However, the infection
of Rule 1003 presents us with a quite rare case of explicit self-
contradiction in a Rule, and I could not pass up such an opportunity
to explore the consequences of this. I want to stress that JonRock
knows nothing more of this attempt than any of you.

So, to the core question: can Promotor KoJen legally distribute this
Proposal? Can he legally refrain from doing so? Rules 1036 and 109
require him to assign text submitted to him as a proposal a Number,
and to distributer this text within 7 days. Prior to its infection,
Rule 1003 took precedence over these Rules and would have prevented
a Proposal like the above from being distributed. Post-infection,
the situation is not so clear, since Rule 1003 now also explcitly
defers to Rule 1036 and 109. 

It is my hope that Promotor KoJen will distribute this Proposal
so that we may see what ensues. It seems certain, and indeed it is
intended, that the legality of distributing this Proposal will end
up being considered by the courts. I think that will be fun for
everyone.

Rule 404/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Legality of Proposals

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

Titles for Proposals

      Every Proposal shall be headed with a Title. This Title shall
      not actually be a part of the Proposal itself and therefore

Rule 789/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules in the
      list of relevant Rules is changed in any way; or until a CFJ
      determines that the injunction no longer applies, as described
      below.  While it remains, it shall guide the application of that
      Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Directives

      A Proposal may contain one or more Directives.  A Directive, if

      Directives which are defined by the Rules may be placed in a
      Proposal.

      If a Proposal containing Directives is adopted, the Directives
      shall take effect in the order that they appear in the Proposal,
      and according to the Rule or Rule which define the type of each
      Directive in question.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal containing a Directive must be

      A Proposal by a Player shall be made by submitting it to the
      Promotor. As soon as possible after receiving the Proposal, the
      Promotor shall assign the Proposal a Number.
      Within seven (7) days of the receipt of the Proposal, and not
      later than any subsequently received Proposal, the Promotor
      shall distribute the numbered Proposal to all Players.

      At the same time e shall distribute any text not part of the
      proposal which is required to be submitted with it, but eir
      failure to do so shall not deprive the act of distributing the
      Proposal of the effects which it would otherwise have.

======================================================================

Statement:

The Assessor's Report of July 1 is in error, in that Chuck
has 94 Extra Votes, and TAL has -80 Extra Votes; and the
Scorekeepor's Report of July 5 is in error, in that
a transfer of at least 189 points from TAL to Chuck was
not recorded.

======================================================================

Arguments:

These errors are due to two transfers required by the Currency
Scam Contest, of 80 EVs and at least 189 points.  (The point transfer
stated in the Contest regulation calls for 199.5 points to be
transferred.  90% of the points necessary for me to win at that
time, however, was 189 points.  A case can be made that 199.5
points were transferred anyway.  Since I do not wish to address
this issue here, I merely state "at least 189 points" were
transferred.

The question of whether these transfers took place hinges on whether
or not they were "involuntary" transfers.  Player's treasuries
may "go negative" due to an involuntary transfer, but not due
to a voluntary transfer.  So if these transfers were involuntary,
they took place; if they were not, they did not.

Rule 1472 states, in part,

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.

These transfers were clearly not voluntary transfers, as they
do not meet the requirements in the first paragraph of Rule 1472
(i.e. they attempted to transfer more points and EVs than TAL had).
Thus, either they are involuntary transfers or they were not transfers
at all.  I would like to address three objections which have been
raised to the proposition that the transfers were involuntary.

1.  It has been alleged that the transfers were not required by
the Rules.  This is clearly not so; Rule 1446 requires Contestants
to obey Contest Regulations; thus, a transfer required by
Contest Regulations is also required by Rule 1446.  Contest
Regulations have no authority in and of themselves; they
have only that authority granted them by the Rules.  In fact,
anything which is required of Players *must* be required by
the Rules, as nothing else has, in and of itself, the legal
authority to require obedience.

2.  It has been alleged that any transfers taking place directly
due to Player actions are voluntary transfers.  There is nothing
in Rule 1472 to suggest this.  True, 1472 does define voluntary
transfers as taking place upon the action of a Player, but there
is *nothing* to suggest that all point changes directly due to
Players' actions must be voluntary.

3.  It has been alleged that the transfers are required by the Rules,
but not *specifically* required by the Rules.  The American Heritage
Dictionary, 2nd ed., lists "specifically" as an adverb form of
"specific."  "Specific" is defined as "explicitly set forth; definite."
The second of these is easier to demonstrate: the transfers required
are very definite, being 80 Extra Votes and 199.5 points from
TAL to me.  Are they explicitly set forth?  Yes, Rule 1446
explicitly states that Contestants must follow contest Regulations.

Thus, I conclude that the transfers in question are specifically
required by the Rules and are thus involuntary transfers.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: FALSE

Aguments:

I'll address the Caller's points in order:

# 1.  It has been alleged that the transfers were not required by
# the Rules.  This is clearly not so; Rule 1446 requires Contestants
# to obey Contest Regulations; thus, a transfer required by
# Contest Regulations is also required by Rule 1446.  Contest
# Regulations have no authority in and of themselves; they
# have only that authority granted them by the Rules.  In fact,
# anything which is required of Players *must* be required by
# the Rules, as nothing else has, in and of itself, the legal
# authority to require obedience.

It is true that any Contest Regulation has force only through the
authority of 1446, and thus falls on the precedence scale along with
1446.  (Note this fact.)

# 2.  It has been alleged that any transfers taking place directly
# due to Player actions are voluntary transfers.  There is nothing
# in Rule 1472 to suggest this.  True, 1472 does define voluntary
# transfers as taking place upon the action of a Player, but there
# is *nothing* to suggest that all point changes directly due to
# Players' actions must be voluntary.

This is true.  There is nothing in 1472 to suggest that a Player cannot
trigger an involuntary transfer by an act of free will.  I willingly
took on the office of Herald, does that make my salary a voluntary
transfer?

# 3.  It has been alleged that the transfers are required by the Rules,
# but not *specifically* required by the Rules.  The American Heritage
# Dictionary, 2nd ed., lists "specifically" as an adverb form of
# "specific."  "Specific" is defined as "explicitly set forth; definite."

# TAL to me.  Are they explicitly set forth?  Yes, Rule 1446
# explicitly states that Contestants must follow contest Regulations.

This, in fact, was my first argument against this scam.  My reading
at first led me to the conclusion that this language-- "specifically
required by the Rules" -- meant that this only applied to clauses
within *Rules* that award/penalize some explicit amount of currency.

However, the Caller's argument sways me a considerable distance because
the only rational way to adjudicate any Contest Regulation's
relationship to the Ruleset as a whole, is through its enabling
legislation, 1446. The Contest Regulations can be considered, in effect,
an invisible part of Rule 1446, only applicable to the Contestmaster and
Contestant.

I am swayed the rest of the way by the following fact:

             Rule 1446 takes precedence over 1472!

In a bizarre oversight, 1472 does not claim precedence over any
other Rule, Ordinance, anything, that claims to proscribe a Currency
transfer.

In effect, it does not matter what the language of 1472 has to say
about voluntary and involuntary transfers, negative and non-negative
totals-- it defers to the Contest Rule!

Those who are frightened by the prospect may cling to the following
clause in 1446:

   "All Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
    except where these conflict with the Rules."

This doesn't solve the problem because the Regulation:

   "4.  Within 72 hours after becoming a Contestant, TAL shall transfer
        80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from TAL's Treasury to Chuck's
        Treasury. TAL shall be responsible for reporting these transfers
        to the appropriate Officers.  After these transfers take place
        and the transfers are reported, this Contest shall be dissolved.
        A Contestant ceases to be a Contestant when this Contest is
        dissolved."

Doesn't conflict with the Rules.  Rule 1446 absolves Contestant and
Contestmaster from following Regulations that Conflict with the Rules--
it does not absolve them from being forced to act in a way that conflict
with the Rules. If there was a conflict, it was in TAL's attempt to
comply, *not* in the Regulation.  And, as stated beforehand, that
conflict (if it existed at all) is resolved by 1472's deference to 1446.

The only remaining consideration is who was legally responsible to
report TAL's transfer.  TAL was the Player who did the Reporting, but
according to 1446:

     "[The Contestmaster] reports all currency transfers taking place
      under the Regulations, is the Executor of the Contest Fund, and
      maintains the Regulations."

In applying my interpretation of the contest Regs as extension of 1446,
we have a situation where the Rule explicitly contradicts itself,
saying in one place that Chuck (who did no reporting) should report the
transfer, and in another that TAL (who did report) should be the Player
to Report the transfer.

However, one clause is within the Rule itself and the other in its
subordinate Regulations. Since there is a conflict, I must give the actual
Rule greater weight than the Regulations it enables.
Rule 1446 MUST take precedence over the Regulations it empowers,
or else it could not empower them at all--
it would have no power to bind them or define their characteristics.

It was Chuck's duty, as Contestmaster, to report the transfer, despite
the language of Reg 5. The transfer has not yet been reported.

Does that invalidate the transfer?

As to *that* question, rule 1472 claims to cancel any unreported
Currency transfer after the passage of a week.  But, as I've pointed
out, almost every Rule takes precedence over 1472, including 1446.  1472
doesn't have the power to invalidate TAL's transfer no matter how long
it takes Chuck to report it.

1472 also claims that a transfer cannot occur before it is reported.  This
explicitly conflicts with the language of Reg 5, which specifies:
"Within 72 hours after becoming a Contestant."  Since 1446 takes
precedence, the transfer had to have taken place at that time, no mater
who did or did not report it.

So even if Chuck did not report the transfer, because of the wording of
Reg 5, the transfer occurred.  Presumably this happened 72 hours after
TAL became a Contestant.  This would be sometime during the evening of
Sun, July 2.

However, the documents alleged to be in error were dated the day before
this transfer occurred, so I must rule the specific Statement FALSE.

======2. Rule 1472

Rule 1472/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Transfer of Currencies

      The owner of a given Treasury may, at any time, transfer
      any or all of the units of Currency within that Treasury to any
      other Treasury, so long as this transfer is permitted by the
      Rules.  Such a transfer is known as a "voluntary" transfer.
      Voluntary transfers are restricted to positive quantities, and
      in no case may more of a given Currency be transferred from a
      Treasury than that Treasury possessed prior to the transfer.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency must be notified as soon as
      possible by the owner of the Treasury from which a
      voluntary transfer is made.  If a voluntary transfer is not
      reported to the Recordkeepor within seven days, it is cancelled
      and does not take place.  

      Transfers which are not voluntary transfers ("involuntary"
      transfers) may only be made as specifically required by the
      Rules.  Such transfers must be reported to the Recordkeepors of
      the Currencies involved as soon as possible thereafter, by a
      Player specified by the Rules.  Involuntary transfers may be of
      any amount (limited only by MUQ rounding), and may involve
      amounts greater than the amount in the Treasury from which the
      transfer originates.

      If an involuntary transfer is not reported to the Recordkeepor
      within seven days, or there is no Rule which requires a Player
      to report the involuntary transfer, the transfer is cancelled
      and does not take place.

      All transfers take effect no sooner than the time the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency is informed of the transfer.

======3. Currency Scam Contest Regulations

1.  The Contestmaster is Chuck.  The Contestmaster may not
be changed.

2.  Only TAL is permitted to become a Contestant.  The Entry Fee
is 1 Reform Group Coin.

3.  Any Currencies in the Currency Scam Contest Fund at any time
shall be transferred to the Contestmaster.

4.  Within 72 hours after becoming a Contestant, TAL shall transfer
80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from TAL's Treasury to Chuck's Treasury.
TAL shall be responsible for reporting these transfers to the
appropriate Officers.  After these transfers take place and the
transfers are reported, this Contest shall be dissolved.  A Contestant
ceases to be a Contestant when this Contest is dissolved.

5.  These regulations shall not be changed.

======4. TAL's message of June 29 reporting the transfers

Date:         Thu, 29 Jun 95 19:15:45 SET
From: KUNNE@CERNVM.cern.ch
Subject:      BUS: More transfers
To: nomic-business@teleport.com


The Currency Scam Contest Regulations require me to transfer
80 Extra Votes and 199.5 Points from my Treasury to Chuck's Treasury.
(I should have read the small-print first, I guess  :-)

However, as I emptied carefully my Treasury just a minute ago, one
might think that there is a problem.

Luckily the Rule 1472 ("Transfer of Currencies") provides a solution.
Note that both these transfers are "involuntary" transfers in the
sense of Rule 1472. Both are specifically required by the Contest
Rule, which obliges me to obey the Regulations.

Note also, that "involuntary" transfers may result in a Player ending up
with a negative number of a certain Currency.

Therefore:
Mir. Assessor, please take note that I transfer 80 Extra Votes from my
Treasury to Chuck's Treasury, an "involuntary" transfer required by the
Currency Scam Contest Regulations.

Mir. Scorekeepor, please take note that I transfer 199.5 Points from my
Treasury to Chuck's Treasury, an "involuntary" transfer required by the
Currency Scam Contest Regulations.

As these transfers have now been reported, the CS Contest shall be
dissolved and I cease to be a Contestant.

Who can guess, what the next step will be in this Scam?

  6/30:   Michael to elJefe:  4


Special note:

TAL's 80 EV transfer to Chuck is invalidated as in excess of his
EV holdings, under Rule 1472.  TAL's claim that the transfer is
"involuntary" is rejected, since Rule 1466's requirement that TAL 
obey the Contest Regs is phrased generally and not "specifically"
with respect to this kind of transfer.

An "involuntary" transfer must be an automatic one which takes 
place without any action on the player's part, and there is no Rule
enabling Contest Regulations to cause such a transfer (except as 
detailed in Rule 1466, when a contest dissolves).

Evidence added by Judge:

Rule 1446/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      If the Contest Regulations require a transfer to be made, but
      the Contest Fund has insufficient currencies to permit that
      transfer to be made, sufficient currencies to cover the transfer
      shall be involuntarily transferred from the Contestmaster's
      Treasury to the Contest Fund.  The Contestmaster shall report
      this transfer to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

      precedence.  If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly
      says of itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule)

(in case Ian did not forward this, I'm providing it to you)

As Kelly suggested, I have examined my records for a notification 
from Chuck as to a transfer of EV's under the Regulations of the
Currency Scam Contest.  Chuck did not report such a transfer.

Chuck did report a Reform Coin transfer to me in my role as Reform 
Vizier. This has nothing to do with EV's, but I'm including it so
that you can see for yourself.

He also made a COE after the Assessor's Report of July 1.  After
careful examination, I find that his COE also does not contain a report
of a transfer, but simply claims that the reported number of EV's for 
Chuck and TAL is wrong.

I claim that this Assessor's report is in error, in that Chuck
should have 94 Extra Votes and TAL should have -80.

First, I believe the transfer *is* specifically required by the
Rules.  After all, a 79-EV transfer would not have satisfied
Rule 1446.  How much more specific can you get?

The allegation that the transfer was involuntary because it
required action of TAL is also invalid.   There is nothing in
Rule 1472 that states or implies that a transfer dependent on
the action of a Player is automatically voluntary.  (True, it
describes voluntary transfers, which are dependent on the
action of a Player, but it does *not* say that all transfers
dependent on a Player's action are voluntary.)

If we were to follow this argument, the two point loss when
declining to serve as Judgement would also be a voluntary
transfer, as it takes place only upon the action of the Player!

=============================================================

Arguments of Caller (Kelly):

Rule 1454 requires the Rulekeepor to select a _random_ integer in the 
range [M,N], where M and N are, respecctively, the number of the
lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that week.
 
Rule 1079 requires that the any "random" selection be made such that 
the selection be made such that each possible choice has equal 
probability of being selected. 

Chuck's procedure for selecting an integer in the required range 
clearly does not result in a randomly-selected integer as defined by 
the Rules; the number of possible outcomes of the selection mandated
by 1479 is nearly 1400, and, as TAL has postulated, the number of 
ingredients in a random foodstuff more closely approximates a Poisson
distribution, rather than the uniform distribution called for by 1079.
Hence, this selection procedure has a much greater probability of
selecting the integers at the lower end of the distribution than those 
at the higher end, and is therefore not a "random" selection as 
defined by the Rules. 

KoJen's use of this selection method does not violate 1079 because 
KoJen employed an arbitrary mapping between the generated integer and 
the set of objects to select from.  The inclusion of such an arbitrary
mapping introduces a randomicity which is not present in the case 
under consideration.  A finding of TRUE on this CFJ should in no way 
invalidate the methodology employed by KoJen in selecting a new 
Notary. 
 
==============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Andre):

In the case of CFJ 789 I judge TRUE. 

I think we all agree that Chuck's method was not random in the sense of the 
Rules. Eir method gave a far higher chance to yield one of the lower integers
in the given range, thus the choice was not random as described in Rule 1079. 
 
However, did e choose a Virus Number, or was e posting a completely bogus 
report? In my opinion by clearly specifying it as such he HAD selected a
Virus Number, and done so in an incorrect way. I do agree there could be a 
discussion at this point, however. 

===============================================================

Arguments of Justiciar (Steve):

There is a broad consensus that Chuck did not use a random process
in his attempt to select a Virus Number (see the evidence adduced
with the original CFJ). However, I part company from Judge Andre
when he concludes from this that Chuck violated Rule 1454. For the
wording of Rule 1454 is quite clear: nothing is a Virus Number that
is not randomly selected. Since Chuck did not select a random number,
he did not select a Virus Number. Hence he did not select Rule 106
to be infected, despite his claim to the contrary. The correct
conclusion to draw, therefore, is that Chuck posted an erroneous or
misleading Report. However, nothing in Rule 1454 prohibits Chuck
from doing this. So the Statement is FALSE.

============================================================

Arguments of pro-Speaker (KoJen)

Clearly Chuck did not use a process which could yield any of the outcomes with
equal probability, as required by Rule 1079. So he has not yet chosen any Rule
to be infected, and is not in violation for infecting an incorrect Rule.

(As an aside, he *is* actually in violation of Rule 1454 for another reason: By
failing to choose *any* Rule to be infected, he is in violation of Rule 1454 and
the "As Soon As Possible" Rule. But that is not the subject of this CFJ.)

============================================================

Arguments of pro-COTC (Vanyel)

In Chuck's first message alleging to be the Virus Report, he said that
Rule 106 was infected.  However, as he did not select a random number in
the correct range, there was no Virus Number then, and no Rule was
infected.  There is no rule against counting the number of ingredients
on a soup can, diddling with the number and posting the whole mess to
nomic-business.  And, there is no rule against posting that a rule was
infected... thus, Chuck didn't violate rule 1454.

============================================================

Evidence provided by Caller (Kelly):

I.   Rule 1079/0 
II.  Rule 1454/0 
III. Chuck's Report of Virus Activity 
 
-------I. 
 
Rule 1079/0 (Mutable, MI=1) 
Definition of "Random" 
 
      All occurrences of the word "random" or forms of it shall be 
      taken to mean "any one of the choices with equally distributed 
      possibility for each choice". 

-------II. 
 
Rule 1454/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
The Virus
 
      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect 
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection". 
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is 
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus 
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for 
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes. 
 
      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as 
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic 
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range 
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the 
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that 
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If 
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus 
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not 
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as 
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (which are not the
      numbers of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In 
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in 
      that week.
 
      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection 
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion 
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce 
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e 
      shall that no Rule has been infected. 
 
      An infected Rule is amended in the following way, given that 
      other Rules permit it: if the Rule does not already contain the 
      sentence "This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not 
      contain this sentence.", then that sentence is appended to the 
      Rule. If the Rule already contains the sentence, then the 
      sentence is deleted from the Rule.
 
      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the 
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.

Subject: OFF: Virus Report 
 
In the past I have used a pseudo-random number generator to
select the virus numbers.  Today I have decided to use a different 
method. 
 
For each number to be selected, I will select an item from my
kitchen.  I will count the number of ingredients, take that 
number modulo 1382, and add 101.  This gives a number in 
the range 101-1482 inclusive.
 
The first item is Nile Spice Black Bean Soup.  It has 5 ingredients. 
106 is a Rule, but since it has MI=3, it is not amended. 
(I have added a line to the history noting the infection, however.) 
Rule 106 now reads: 
 
====== 
 
Rule 106/0 (Semimutable, MI=3) 
Adopting Proposals 
 
      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A 
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved. 
 
History: 
Initial Immutable Rule 106, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1073, Oct. 4 1994 
Amended by Proposal 1278, Oct. 24 1994 
Renumbered from 1073 to 106 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994
Infected, but not amended, by Rule 1454, May 7 1995 
Infected, but not amended, by Rule 1454, Jul. 10 1995
