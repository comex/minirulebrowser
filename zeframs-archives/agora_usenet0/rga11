I have now set up an Agora Nomic page of my own at
<http://dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/>.

It includes a link to the current Ruleset of Agora, which can also
be accessed directly at <http://dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/>.

It also includes information about the Journal of Agora Nomic,
the first journal devoted exclusively to Nomic.  It is expected
that the first issue will be published in late February.
The JAN page can be accessed directly at <http://dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/jan/>.

For those of you unfamiliar with Nomic, it is, briefly, a game
in which the Rules can be changed, and then play continues
according to the new Rules.  It was invented by Peter Suber
and first published in Douglas Hofstadter's June 1982 Scientific
American column (reprinted in Hofstadter's _Metamagical Themas_)
A revised set of rules was published in Suber's book _The Paradox
of Self-Amendment_.  For more information, check out Malcom
"Blob" Ryan's Nomic FAQ at <http://www.cse.unsw.edu/~s2119737/nomic-faq.html>.

Agora is one particular incarnation of Nomic being played by e-mail.
