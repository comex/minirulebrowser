This was during the time of the Nomic World MUD, before I joined.

7 months later, after the Nomic World game crashed, Agora Nomic was
created.  It is still around, 4 1/2 years later.  One web page is at
<http://www.sff.net/people/SASwann/nomic/nomicpge.htm#agora>.

Even slightly older (it started as a subgame of Nomic World), though
not an "ordinary" nomic, is the Fantasy Rules Committee, official web
page at <http://www.win.tue.nl/cs/fm/engels/frc/>.

These are, as far as I know, the two oldest surviving nomic-like games
on the Internet.

Greetings,
Ørjan (once upon a time a Nomic World Player.)
