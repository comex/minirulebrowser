there are.  see "http://copper.ucs.indiana.edu/~sgoehrin/nomic.html"
for some information and a horde of pointers to other Nomic pages.

i am not aware of any interactive Nomic servers; however, there are
several email-based games in progress.  a USENET-based game is in the
works.

one of the better-known and larger email Nomic games is Agora Nomic.
Agora has three mailing lists on which it conducts its business.  they
are nomic-official, nomic-business, and nomic-discussion, all at
teleport.com.  send mail to majordomo@teleport.com to subscribe to any
of these lists (uses standard Majordomo commands).  prospective
Players are advised to "lurk" for a while on the lists before joining
the Game.  Agora is open to all comers; there are no restrictions on
who may join.

any questions about Agora Nomic may be addressed to its Ambassador,
Kelly Martin (me) at kelly@poverty.bloomington.in.us.

there has been a smattering of it in rec.games.abstract over time.
