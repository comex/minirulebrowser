Hi all.  Please be assured that I'm still here.  Watching, waiting.  
Happy to participate in any democratic, constructive solution to our 
woes.  Hell, I'll even reverse my vote on 1081 if it will make you 
happy.  

I have my own opinion on recent events, as I'm sure my `judgement' 
on `CFJ 144' made clear.  But I'm sure none of us wants to see Agora 
fade away.  I hereby make an oath that I will *not* oppose any 
constructive plan for getting Agora back on its feet, if that plan has 
the support of at least four players.  Will that help?

Regards,

I just reread CFJ 143, and I cannot fathom what the confusion is. It is
absolutely unequivocably clear from this that Stella?'s proposals did not
become Rules; therefore the Rule Set was unaffected by Stella?'s proposals
916-1080. 

To refresh everyone's memory, here is a paraphrasing of CFJ 143


CFJ 143 (submitted by Chuck)

Stella?'s submission of Props 916-1080 was illegal as it violated Rule 884. All
effects of the incorrect recording of their passage shall be undone from the
Game State.

(Judged True 5/5/94.)


Some would say that the CFJ cannot be used if the CFJ mechanism was repealed by
the proposals. This is probably true, but the CFJ showed us that the CFJ
mechanism still exists!

There are actually 4 scenarios:

1) Assume Stella's proposals worked. CFJ judged TRUE. CFJ is meaningless, as
the CFJ mechanism no longer exists.

2) Assume Stella's proposals worked. CFJ judged FALSE. CFJ is meaningless, as
the CFJ mechanism no longer exists.

3) Assume Stella's proposals did not work. CFJ judged TRUE. The CFJ outcome is
consistent with the postulated Platonic Game State, showing that our assumption
was indeed correct.

4) Assume Stella's proposals did not work. CFJ judged FALSE. This CFJ outcome
is inconsistent with the postulated Platonic Game State, creating a paradox.


Notce that only scenario 3) above bestows any meaning whatsoever upon the CFJ
outcome, and this is exactly the case which holds that Stella?'s proposals did
not work. 

Since the CFJ was judged TRUE, we are forced to choose between scenario 1 and 3
as the true state of affairs. But which one? Since one of them leads to an
unambiguous and consistent Game State (3), and one of them remains ambiguous
(1), it seems proper to adopt this scenario.


Can we just take an informal simple majority vote to determine if this is the
correct interpretation? Note that by the "permissibility of the unprohibited"
(R116) this is permitted even in scenario 1, because in the absense of other
Rules on adjusting the Game State, a simple majority vote is permissible simply
because it is not prohibited. And in scenario 3, it would merely affirm what
has already been confirmed by CFJ.

Let's call this the Game State Merge Resolution. Vote within one Week.



KoJen votes FOR the Game State Merge Resolution.

If voting FOR the Game State Merge Resolution means that Stella?'s
proposals should be considered incorrectly voted upon and that the game
state should exist pretty much as it did before the disastrous voting (that
should not have been), then:

Ian votes FOR the Game State Merge Resolution.

I *will* vote FOR the game state merge resolution, in the interests
of continuing Agora, but I make my vote conditional on a decision on
the appeal of CFJ 143.  If CFJ 143 decides something inconsistent
with the `game state merge resolution', my vote changes to AGAINST.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 6 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.

========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted

      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.

      applied.

Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.

      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.  Any Player who submits a Proposal which
      includes a Declaration which has not been approved by
      legislation shall be guilty of a Class A Crime.

      that he forfeits.  When a player forfeits, he remains registered
      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may

      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)

      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

      be equal to 20% of the average score of all Active Players. If
      any active Player's score is less than the Poverty Line at the
      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient

      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member

      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

========================================

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

========================================

Rule 726 (Mutable)
Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 730 (Mutable)
Auction for Stocks Owned by Leaving Players

730.  Stocks of leaving Players II

      When a Player leaves the game, any Stock they own shall be sold
      for Marks in an Auction, with the Banker as Auctioneer.
      The proceedings shall go to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 731 (Mutable)
Creation of and Auction for Stocks of New Players

731.  Stocks of new Players

      When there exists no Stock for Player X, one shall be created
      and sold for Marks in an Auction, with the Banker as Auctioneer.
      The proceedings shall go to Player X, unless they obtain their
      own Stock, in which case the proceedings shall go to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

========================================

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

========================================

Rule 748 (Mutable)
Don't Count Blank or Required Lines in Proposal Length

748.  Whitespace in a Rule

      Whenever the length of a Proposal is determined, any blank lines
      within that Proposal shall not be counted towards the number of
      lines in that Proposal. In addition, any lines which are
      required by legislation, including a Title or a Declaration,
      shall likewise not be counted towards the number of lines in
      that Proposal.

========================================

Rule 749 (Mutable)
Weekly Lottery for Proposers

749.  Weekly Lottery Correction
      
      Every time a Voter proposes a Proposal, that Voter shall gain
      one Entry into a weekly Lottery. Each week, a random Entry shall
      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing
      shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the week.

========================================

Rule 750 (Mutable)
Indexing of Amended Rules

750.  Indexing of Amended Rules

      Whenever a Proposal is Passed which Amends a Rule, that Rule 
      shall also be Amended as follows.
      1.  If the last line of text of the Rule begins with '(*' and
      ends with '*)' then the characters '/@' shall be inserted
      immediately before the final '*)'.
      2.  If the last line of text of the Rule does not begin with
      '(*' and end with '*)' then the following line of text shall be
      appended to the text of the Rule:  '(*Was: @*)'.
      3.  After clauses 1. and 2. above have been applied, the '@'
      which appears in the last line of text of the Rule shall be
      replaced with the Number of the Rule which was Amended by the
      Amending Proposal.

========================================

Rule 754 (Mutable)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

Rule 755 (Mutable)
Champions

755.  Regarding Winners

      Let there be known the Patent Title known as Champion. This
      Patent Title shall be given to every Player who Wins a Game of
      eNomic, or who has Won a Game of eNomic. This Patent Title shall
      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",
      substituting for X the ratio of the Points required for that
      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped
      Player to Win.
      (*Was: 654*)

========================================

Rule 758 (Mutable)
Auctions
 
758.  Auctions I
 
      When, for any reason, the owner of a Nomic entity is to be
      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

========================================

Rule 761 (Mutable)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

Rule 762 (Mutable)
Player Gets a Share of the Treasury Upon Leaving the Group

762.  Shared Group Accounts

      If, for any reason, Player X ceases to be a Member of Group Y,
      then Player X shall recieve a share of the contents of the Y
      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes
      precedence over all other Rules which determine which Point and
      Currency transfers are legal and/or taxable.

========================================

Rule 763 (Mutable)
Disbanding a Group

763.  Disbanding a Group

      If at any time a Group X has fewer than three members, or Group
      X does not have a Vizier, then Group X shall cease to exist.
      Immediately before Group X ceases to exist, a number of Points
      equal to two times the number of X Coins in existence at that
      moment shall be removed from the X Treasury, and then all of
      the X Coins shall be converted to Points, at the rate of two
      Points per Coin. 
      (*Was: 720*)

========================================

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

========================================

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Rule 779 (Mutable)
Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they
      cast on that Proposal are invalid, shall not be deemed to have
      been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

Rule 789 (Mutable)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This
      rule applies to Offices in general, and thus defers to Rules for

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,
      when permitted, over other Rules which require sooner
      distribution.

      If Proposal "Schemes" exist, then for the purpose of the
      Proposal limit, a Scheme shall count as a single Proposal.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 6 of 6 

========================================

Rule 880 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

880.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.
      (*Was: 405*)

========================================

Rule 881 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

881.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Officer is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player if a Proposal to
      that effect passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

Rule 883 (Mutable)
Reward for finding Nomiclike Games

883.  Close a hole in a Policy Directive

      or Nomiclike Games taking place on the Internet.
      The find of any such Game will be rewarded by a
      bonus of five Points.

      If another Player than the Ambassador locates such
      a Game first, five Points will be transfered from the
      Ambassador to this Player.

      To qualify for the reward, at least half the Players of such a
      Game should not play already in *this* Nomic Game.

========================================

Rule 884 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

884.  Declaring Proposals

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. A Player who
      submits a proposal which does not include a Declaration, as
      described here and in other legislation, shall be guilty of a
      Class C Crime. Any Player who submits a proposal which includes
      a Declaration that has not been approved by legislation shall be
      guilty of a Class A Crime.  The Declarations shall be as
      follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

      Additional legislation may define additional legal Declarations
      or change the presentation of the Declaration, but this Rule
      shall take precedence in all other cases.

      (*Was: 647/793*)

========================================

Rule 891 (Mutable)
Non-Rule-Change Proposals

891.  Only 4 types of Proposed Rule Changes

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  All
      proposals, except those which have one of the following
      declarations:
          (Creates a Rule)
          (Amends a Rule)
          (Repeals a Rule)
          (Transmutes a Rule)
      are Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC Proposals).  However,
      only those NRC Proposals defined in other Rules may
      be proposed.

      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.

      policy directive.

========================================

Rule 895 (Immutable)
RC and NRC Proposals

895.  Other Rule Changes and Proposals

      New kinds of Rule Changes may be defined by the Rules, so long
      as they Create, Amend, Repeal, Transmute, or otherwise change
      one or more Rules, without making any other direct changes to
      the Game State.

      All proposed Rule Changes are Proposals.  Other kinds of
      Proposal may be defined by the Rules.  They shall be treated as
      proposed Rule Changes in all respects, save that they shall not
      change any Rule in any way, and they shall not under any
      circumstances be incorporated into the Ruleset.  A given class
      of such Proposals shall not be valid unless the Rules define
      which Player or Players must maintain a current record of that
      class of Proposals, or explicitly state that that class need not
      be recorded.

      The first paragraph of this Rule does not apply to Proposals
      that are not Rule Changes.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules describing the
      nature of Rule Changes and/or proposed Rule Changes.

========================================

Rule 897 (Mutable)
Barring Players from Judgement

897.  Barring Players From Judgement

      A Player that Calls For Judgement may Bar up to three Players

      Statement.

========================================

Rule 900 (Mutable)

      Decrees to Appeal Judgements.

      The Ambassador shall maintain a current record of all Foreign 
      Policy Directives.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a current record of all other
      Decrees that have a continuing legal effect.

      The Archivist shall maintain a record of all other Decrees.

      This Rule applies to Decrees in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific types of Decrees.

========================================

Rule 901 (Mutable)
The Scorekeepor

901.  The Office of Scorekeepor

      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeepor. The
      Scorekeepor is responsible for maintaining a list of the Point
      Scores of all current Players and other Game Entities, making
      such a list available on request as well as posting it at least
      once a Week, and for notifying Players in the event of a Win on
      Points. E must abide by all Rules governing Scoring, but in
      cases where the Rules are unclear or contradictory is to use eir
      best judgement in determining Scores.

      The Scorekeepor is chiefly a tabulator of Point changes posted
      by others. E is only Legally Responsible for tabulating those
      classes of Point changes where Rules specifically bestow Legal
      Responsibility upon the Scorekeepor.
      (*Was: 493*)

========================================

Rule 902 (Mutable)
Salary of the Scorekeepor

902.  Scorekeepor Salary

      The Salary of the Scorekeepor is 5 Points per Week.

========================================

Rule 903 (Mutable)
Point Changes which the Scorekeepor Must Record

903.  Point Changes Automatically Applied by the Scorekeepor, Part 1 

      Classes of Point changes which the Scorekeepor is Legally
      Responsible for detecting and tabulating without a specific
      request by another Player include, but are not necessarily
      limited to the following:

      * Salaries which consist of a fixed Point award per Week.

      * Transfers of Points specifically requested by the owner of the
      Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

      * Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically
      requested by the Vizier of that Group in a message received by
      the Scorekeepor; however, the Vizier is legally responsible for
      ensuring that such a Point transfer is consistent with eir
      Group's Ordinances.

      * Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

      * Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other
      Rules.

      * Point changes resulting from a Player joining or leaving the
      Game.

      * Point changes resulting from dissolution of a Group.

      * Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of
      Speakership.

      The Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible for ensuring that the
      above Point changes are performed according to all Rules.

      Additional classes of Point changes which are the Scorekeepor's
      Legal Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

========================================

Rule 905 (Mutable)
No Point Changes if No One Reports Them

905.  Point Changes With Legal Responsibility Unspecified

      If a Rule mandates a change in Points, but no Rules exist which
      define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
      reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Point change
      is cancelled.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing
      changes in Points, to the extent permitted.

========================================

Rule 906 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

906.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      dividends are earned.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

========================================

Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

907.

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.
      (*Was: 805*)

========================================

Rule 908 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.
      (*Was: 781*)

========================================

Rule 910
Appeals and the Justiciar

910.  The Justices and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

========================================

Rule 911 (Mutable)
Appealing Judgement

911.  Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.
      (*Was: 690*)

========================================

Rule 912 (Mutable)
Additional Declarations

912.  Get Rid of Appeal By Proposal

      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:

         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.

I can't quite bring myself to believe that someone would really have
appealed CFJ 143.  If that person believed CFJ 143 to be TRUE, then
obviously there would be no need to appeal.  On the other hand, if e
believed the CFJ to be FALSE, then how can e claim there is a mechanism
for appealing it?  After all the protests about the CFJ not being valid
if the CFJ mechanism didn't exist, e can hardly appeal with a claim
that the CFJ is false if they believe there is no mechanism for appeals
either.
The best e could do would be to refuse to accept the CFJ's legal force,
which is at least a consistent position (even if it's wrong :).

Incidentally, although my vote is not valid if the Ruleset still exists,
and will probably be ignored even if it doesn't:
  I vote FOR the Game Merge State Wotsit Thingy.

The Problem is that the existence of the Electioneer Office itself is
dependent on the Appeal. So even if I do announce it vacant, it will have
no meaning if Ronald's Proposals passed.

But if it can make you happy: I hereby announce the Vacancy of the Office of
Justiciar, volunteers please notice me.

Is it really necessary that all Officers exist before the Appeal can be made?

Greetings,
Oerjan.

You are absolutely correct.  RL has been one continuous hassle.  I just
have not been able to deal with Agora, which is a terrible shame.

As for the aforementioned move, it does seem to me to be the way to go.  I
welcome other constructive solutions and suggestions.

Will do.  And I'm here.

: 
: To refresh everyone's memory, here is a paraphrasing of CFJ 143
: 
: 
: CFJ 143 (submitted by Chuck)
: 
: Stella?'s submission of Props 916-1080 was illegal as it violated Rule 884. All
: effects of the incorrect recording of their passage shall be undone from the
: Game State.
: 
: (Judged True 5/5/94.)
: 
: 
: Some would say that the CFJ cannot be used if the CFJ mechanism was repealed by
: the proposals. This is probably true, but the CFJ showed us that the CFJ
: mechanism still exists!
: 
: There are actually 4 scenarios:
: 
: 1) Assume Stella's proposals worked. CFJ judged TRUE. CFJ is meaningless, as
: the CFJ mechanism no longer exists.
: 
: 2) Assume Stella's proposals worked. CFJ judged FALSE. CFJ is meaningless, as
: the CFJ mechanism no longer exists.
: 
: 3) Assume Stella's proposals did not work. CFJ judged TRUE. The CFJ outcome is
: consistent with the postulated Platonic Game State, showing that our assumption
: was indeed correct.
: 
: 4) Assume Stella's proposals did not work. CFJ judged FALSE. This CFJ outcome
: is inconsistent with the postulated Platonic Game State, creating a paradox.
: 
: 
: Notce that only scenario 3) above bestows any meaning whatsoever upon the CFJ
: outcome, and this is exactly the case which holds that Stella?'s proposals did
: not work. 
: 
: Since the CFJ was judged TRUE, we are forced to choose between scenario 1 and 3
: as the true state of affairs. But which one? Since one of them leads to an
: unambiguous and consistent Game State (3), and one of them remains ambiguous
: (1), it seems proper to adopt this scenario.
: 
: Can we just take an informal simple majority vote to determine if this is the
: correct interpretation? Note that by the "permissibility of the unprohibited"
: (R116) this is permitted even in scenario 1, because in the absense of other
: Rules on adjusting the Game State, a simple majority vote is permissible simply
: because it is not prohibited. And in scenario 3, it would merely affirm what
: has already been confirmed by CFJ.
: 
: Let's call this the Game State Merge Resolution. Vote within one Week.
: 
: KoJen votes FOR the Game State Merge Resolution.
: 
Well done, KoJen!  I wish I had thought of this myself.

Actually, to be fair, I think this is what Chuck has been saying all along.

I vote FOR the Game State Merge Resolution.

Subject: OFF:  New Proposals and a Message from the Speaker on the State of the Game
Status: OR


Fellow Players:

The paralysis that has struck our beloved Game cannot be permitted to
continue.  Some sort of bold action is needed, and is indeed long
overdue on my part.  Therefore, I have reached the following conclusions:

We have before us two possible interpretations of the state of our Ruleset.
One interpretation clearly permits play to continue;  the other is ambiguous
in this regard.  I must stress that Players on both sides have advanced
arguments on their behalf;  it may well be that the true answer depends on
semantics, and is not clearly decideable by the Rules.

Therefore:  I am making a unilateral decision as your Speaker to adopt the
first interpretation, which permits our Game to survive and grow.  The
'Proposals' (so-called) Numbered by myself to be 916-1080 I hereby declare
to be wholly void and without effect.  I fully accept whatever legal action
may be taken against me for my illegal distribution of these 'Proposals'.

The Proposals 1081 and 1082 were wrongly Numbered;  they are properly 916
and 917.  The Voting on them was highly irregular, and the outcome unclear;
I apologize for this and take full responsibility for my actions.

In accordance with the Rules, Player Stella? has Won the Game, and is now
Champion Champion (7/6) Stella?.  I shall begin the transfer of Speakership
immediately, unless the Score Report is challenged by CFJ.

I hope that despite the recent hiatus, that I have not been wholly 
displeasing in the execution of my duties.  I have enjoyed serving as your
Speaker for these last two Games, and will freely do so again if you will
have me.  Yet I must confess that I have a desire to be a Voter in the
coming times, as we repair and prune our Ruleset, also adding a mechanism
to prevent the chaos of recent weeks from ever again gracing our Public
Forum.

To that end, I distribute the following 15 Proposals.  The Voting Period
on them has begun.  Thank you.

Speaker (Just call me 'Lindrum') Garth

=======================

Proposal 918 (Duane)

Nuke the Marxist
(Creates a Rule)

At noon GMT on every fourth Monday of each month, the Banker shall 
remove 1/2 of the Marxist's Marks and divide them evenly amongst all
of the active players, including the Marxist.

[This should get the flow of Marks moving plus move the title around a
bit.]

[ Speaker's Note:  Sure, why not?  :) ]

======================

Proposal 919 (Ko-Jen)

Make Stella? a Scamster
(awards a patent title)

The Patent Title of Scamster shall be awarded to Stella?

[ Speaker's Note:  Heh.  Yes, I'd say he's earned it...  ]

======================

Proposal 920 (Ko-Jen)

The Point Sucker
(creates a rule)

Let there be an entity known as the Point Sucker. The Point Sucker
operates continuously to reset the Points of every Game Entity to 0,
such that while the Point Sucker is operating on a particular Game
Entity, there is no instant at which that Entity's Score is anything
other than 0, regardless of the number of Points gained or lost by
that Entity by other Rules.

The Point Sucker becomes converted to a Point Spewer for an
infinitessimal period of time when a different Player becomes the
Current Champion. During this infinitessimal period of time the Point
Spewer conveys to the new Current Champion the exact number of Points
required to Win, while still operating as a Sucker to all other
Entities.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules governing the Point Reserve,
should such Rules exist.

[Justification: Simplifies Scorekeeping (!), gets around the immutable
Rule requiring Points to Win, and shifts the Game priorities to
something other than Points.]

[ It certainly does simplify Scorekeeping, but I can't say I like it. ]

Proposal 921 (Ko-Jen)

Current Champion
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as the Current Champion. Any Player
may be Current Champion; however, no more than one Player at a time
may be Current Champion. Assignment of the Current Champion is
governed by other Rules.

[Justification: A Player needs to get the Current Champion to Win. How
does e get the Current Champion, with no Rules governing assignment of
Current Champion? There will be eventually, if a Player wants to Win
badly enough!]

[ Can't argue with that.  :) ]

=======================

This is not a Proposal because of Ko-Jen's preexisting one.  I'm just
including it to let Ian know I got it, and to note that he gets the
2 Points for Proto-Proposing.

Non-Proposal (Ian) P

Scamster to Stella?
(Award a Patent Title)

Upon passage of this Proposal, the patent title of "Scamster" will be
awarded to Stella?, who must pay the one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point
Reserve upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and the Patent
Title may not be declined.

======================================================================

Proposal 922 (Jason) P

Patent Title of Prize Doofus
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as Prize Doofus, which shall be
given to such persons who display incredible stupidity, backwardness,
arrogance and ignorance; in the collective opinion of Players of 
eNomic.

This title may be held by Players of Agora Nomic, but is not limited 
to such individuals.  

Candidates for this patent title shall be nominated by any Agora
Nomic Player, in the public forum, whereafter an informal election
will be held.  The election will be conducted by the current Agora
Nomic Banker.  If the Banker receives more FOR votes than AGAINST
votes within the one week period after the nomination, the Patent
Title shall be awarded.  Note that this election has no quorum, and
is not subject to group votes or vototron votes.

The Patent Title(s) of Prize Doofus, if awarded, shall be recorded in 
the Official Phone Books.

======================================================================

Proposal 923 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 825 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 825 be amended to read as follows:

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding 
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 123 determined that 825 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

======================================================================

Proposal 924 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 856 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 856 be amended to read as follows:

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 128 determined that 856 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

========================

PROPOSAL 925 (Stella?) P

Cure 463
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 463 to read:
At least once in any seven day period, the designated scorekeeper
shall distribute the scores of all Players, updated at least up to
and including the previous complete Nomic Week.

If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error, e shall send
a public message pointing out the error.
If the Scorekeepor agrees e shall correct the error and send out
the corrected score report within 72 hours.

If the Scorekeepor disagrees or does not correct the error, the Player
who pointed out the error, may make a Call for Judgement, stating the
error and its correction.
If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then
-the Scorekeepor shall correct the error and send out the corrected
score report within 72 hours;
-the Scorekeepor shall not receive eis salary in the Nomic week
following the Judgment of the CFJ.

If no errors are pointed out in this way within seven days of the posting
of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the accurate
and actual scores for the Game.

[Differences:
1) defined a time limit so that the Scorekeepor is not too far behind;
2) defined an informal and a formal way to correct errors;
3) took out `best efforts' (superflu as e has to obey the Rules);
4) obliged the scorekeepor to correct errors;
5) fines the scorekeepor if it requires a CFJ to get eim correct
his errors]

[ Certainly does clarify things, but rather useless if the Point Sucker
passes. :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 926 (Stella?) P

Cure 905
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 905 to read:
If a Rule mandates a change in score, but no Rules exist which
define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Scorekeepor is
responsible for detecting the score change.
No future Rule shall mandate a score change within naming the
Player responsable for detecting and reporting the score change.

[Made the Scorekeepor legally responsible for detecting changes
for which no other Officer is responsible.
Made it impossible for future Rules to mandate changes without
a Player reporting.]

[ Fills a loophole that had worried me.  Good show! ]

====

PROPOSAL 927 (Stella?)

Timing of scorechanges
(Creates a Rule)

Score changes shall be taken into account in the order that they
are reported by the responsible Player, unless a Rule explicitly
determines otherwise.

If a Player is more than seven days late in reporting a score change,
which e is required to report, and a second Player notices so,
than the second Player shall inform the Scorekeepor and the first
Player of this oversight.

[ The second paragraph seems a bit odd.  Personally, I'd point it out
sooner.  And should there be a penalty for not reporting? ]

====

PROPOSAL 928 (Stella?)

Cure 865
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 865 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

[ Speaker's Note:  Heh.  No comment.  :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 929 (Stella?)

Cure 866
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 866 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

[ Speaker's Note:  Ditto.  :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 930 (Stella?)

Players on Hold Eternally
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 870 by adding the paragraph:
A Player who is On Hold for a period longer than three months,
is deemed to have left the Game and shall be removed from the list of
Players. If the former Player re-enters the same Game, it shall be
with the same score as when e left and e shall not be considered a
new Player. Otherwise, e shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

[Changes the status of a Player who seems to be On Hold eternally]

[ Speaker's Note:  Egad!  You beat me to it! ]

PROPOSAL 931 (Stella?)

Cure 725
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 725 by replacing

"On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
who holds Stock X."

by

"The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the Player
(or Players) who holds Stock X."

[Cures an ambiguous phrase by something hopefully less ambiguous]

is certainly better. ]

Proposal 932 (Garth)

Endangered Rules Act
(Creates a Rule)

The Ruleset must at all times clearly specify a way to Adopt Rule Changes.

If a Rule Change or set of Rule Changes would produce a Ruleset that does
not so specify, that Rule Change (or set thereof) is wholly void and 
without effect.

If disagreement exists as to whether such a Rule Change (or set thereof)
produces such a Ruleset, the Rule Changes in question shall be held in
abeyance until the matter is fully decided by whatever mechanism of
resolving disputes the Rules may provide.  If no such mechanism exists,
the Rule Changes in question shall be voided as provided above.

[ I intend to Transmute this once the bugs have been ironed out. ]

Fellow Players:

The paralysis that has struck our beloved Game cannot be permitted to
continue.  Some sort of bold action is needed, and is indeed long
overdue on my part.  Therefore, I have reached the following conclusions:

We have before us two possible interpretations of the state of our Ruleset.
One interpretation clearly permits play to continue;  the other is ambiguous
in this regard.  I must stress that Players on both sides have advanced
arguments on their behalf;  it may well be that the true answer depends on
semantics, and is not clearly decideable by the Rules.

Therefore:  I am making a unilateral decision as your Speaker to adopt the
first interpretation, which permits our Game to survive and grow.  The
'Proposals' (so-called) Numbered by myself to be 916-1080 I hereby declare
to be wholly void and without effect.  I fully accept whatever legal action
may be taken against me for my illegal distribution of these 'Proposals'.

The Proposals 1081 and 1082 were wrongly Numbered;  they are properly 916
and 917.  The Voting on them was highly irregular, and the outcome unclear;
I apologize for this and take full responsibility for my actions.

In accordance with the Rules, Player Stella? has Won the Game, and is now
Champion Champion (7/6) Stella?.  I shall begin the transfer of Speakership
immediately, unless the Score Report is challenged by CFJ.

I hope that despite the recent hiatus, that I have not been wholly 
displeasing in the execution of my duties.  I have enjoyed serving as your
Speaker for these last two Games, and will freely do so again if you will
have me.  Yet I must confess that I have a desire to be a Voter in the
coming times, as we repair and prune our Ruleset, also adding a mechanism
to prevent the chaos of recent weeks from ever again gracing our Public
Forum.

To that end, I distribute the following 15 Proposals.  The Voting Period
on them has begun.  Thank you.

Speaker (Just call me 'Lindrum') Garth

=======================

Proposal 918 (Duane)

Nuke the Marxist
(Creates a Rule)

At noon GMT on every fourth Monday of each month, the Banker shall 
remove 1/2 of the Marxist's Marks and divide them evenly amongst all
of the active players, including the Marxist.

[This should get the flow of Marks moving plus move the title around a
bit.]

[ Speaker's Note:  Sure, why not?  :) ]

======================

Proposal 919 (Ko-Jen)

Make Stella? a Scamster
(awards a patent title)

The Patent Title of Scamster shall be awarded to Stella?

[ Speaker's Note:  Heh.  Yes, I'd say he's earned it...  ]

======================

Proposal 920 (Ko-Jen)

The Point Sucker
(creates a rule)

Let there be an entity known as the Point Sucker. The Point Sucker
operates continuously to reset the Points of every Game Entity to 0,
such that while the Point Sucker is operating on a particular Game
Entity, there is no instant at which that Entity's Score is anything
other than 0, regardless of the number of Points gained or lost by
that Entity by other Rules.

The Point Sucker becomes converted to a Point Spewer for an
infinitessimal period of time when a different Player becomes the
Current Champion. During this infinitessimal period of time the Point
Spewer conveys to the new Current Champion the exact number of Points
required to Win, while still operating as a Sucker to all other
Entities.

This Rule takes precedence over Rules governing the Point Reserve,
should such Rules exist.

[Justification: Simplifies Scorekeeping (!), gets around the immutable
Rule requiring Points to Win, and shifts the Game priorities to
something other than Points.]

[ It certainly does simplify Scorekeeping, but I can't say I like it. ]

Proposal 921 (Ko-Jen)

Current Champion
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as the Current Champion. Any Player
may be Current Champion; however, no more than one Player at a time
may be Current Champion. Assignment of the Current Champion is
governed by other Rules.

[Justification: A Player needs to get the Current Champion to Win. How
does e get the Current Champion, with no Rules governing assignment of
Current Champion? There will be eventually, if a Player wants to Win
badly enough!]

[ Can't argue with that.  :) ]

=======================

This is not a Proposal because of Ko-Jen's preexisting one.  I'm just
including it to let Ian know I got it, and to note that he gets the
2 Points for Proto-Proposing.

Non-Proposal (Ian) P

Scamster to Stella?
(Award a Patent Title)

Upon passage of this Proposal, the patent title of "Scamster" will be
awarded to Stella?, who must pay the one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point
Reserve upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and the Patent
Title may not be declined.

======================================================================

Proposal 922 (Jason) P

Patent Title of Prize Doofus
(creates a rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as Prize Doofus, which shall be
given to such persons who display incredible stupidity, backwardness,
arrogance and ignorance; in the collective opinion of Players of 
eNomic.

This title may be held by Players of Agora Nomic, but is not limited 
to such individuals.  

Candidates for this patent title shall be nominated by any Agora
Nomic Player, in the public forum, whereafter an informal election
will be held.  The election will be conducted by the current Agora
Nomic Banker.  If the Banker receives more FOR votes than AGAINST
votes within the one week period after the nomination, the Patent
Title shall be awarded.  Note that this election has no quorum, and
is not subject to group votes or vototron votes.

The Patent Title(s) of Prize Doofus, if awarded, shall be recorded in 
the Official Phone Books.

======================================================================

Proposal 923 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 825 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 825 be amended to read as follows:

      Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on
      votes or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if
      said Proposal was passed unanimously.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
      receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding 
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 123 determined that 825 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

======================================================================

Proposal 924 (Jason) P

Amending Rule 856 to give it legal force
(amends a rule)

Let the text of rule 856 be amended to read as follows:

      Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
      a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
      many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
      restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
      Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
      Conserved Quantity.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules regarding
      voting.

[This proposed amendment simply asserts precedence of this rule over
rule 761.  CFJ 128 determined that 856 was without force because 761
implicitly took precedence.  The proposal rectifies matters.]

========================

PROPOSAL 925 (Stella?) P

Cure 463
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 463 to read:
At least once in any seven day period, the designated scorekeeper
shall distribute the scores of all Players, updated at least up to
and including the previous complete Nomic Week.

If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error, e shall send
a public message pointing out the error.
If the Scorekeepor agrees e shall correct the error and send out
the corrected score report within 72 hours.

If the Scorekeepor disagrees or does not correct the error, the Player
who pointed out the error, may make a Call for Judgement, stating the
error and its correction.
If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then
-the Scorekeepor shall correct the error and send out the corrected
score report within 72 hours;
-the Scorekeepor shall not receive eis salary in the Nomic week
following the Judgment of the CFJ.

If no errors are pointed out in this way within seven days of the posting
of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the accurate
and actual scores for the Game.

[Differences:
1) defined a time limit so that the Scorekeepor is not too far behind;
2) defined an informal and a formal way to correct errors;
3) took out `best efforts' (superflu as e has to obey the Rules);
4) obliged the scorekeepor to correct errors;
5) fines the scorekeepor if it requires a CFJ to get eim correct
his errors]

[ Certainly does clarify things, but rather useless if the Point Sucker
passes. :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 926 (Stella?) P

Cure 905
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 905 to read:
If a Rule mandates a change in score, but no Rules exist which
define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Scorekeepor is
responsible for detecting the score change.
No future Rule shall mandate a score change within naming the
Player responsable for detecting and reporting the score change.

[Made the Scorekeepor legally responsible for detecting changes
for which no other Officer is responsible.
Made it impossible for future Rules to mandate changes without
a Player reporting.]

[ Fills a loophole that had worried me.  Good show! ]

====

PROPOSAL 927 (Stella?)

Timing of scorechanges
(Creates a Rule)

Score changes shall be taken into account in the order that they
are reported by the responsible Player, unless a Rule explicitly
determines otherwise.

If a Player is more than seven days late in reporting a score change,
which e is required to report, and a second Player notices so,
than the second Player shall inform the Scorekeepor and the first
Player of this oversight.

[ The second paragraph seems a bit odd.  Personally, I'd point it out
sooner.  And should there be a penalty for not reporting? ]

====

PROPOSAL 928 (Stella?)

Cure 865
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 865 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

[ Speaker's Note:  Heh.  No comment.  :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 929 (Stella?)

Cure 866
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 866 by replacing

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Proposal."

by

"When proposed in this manner, the Proposer receives 2 Points, at
the end of the Voting Period on that Proposal.
The Speaker must mention this payment when e distributes the Voting
results.

[ Speaker's Note:  Ditto.  :) ]

====

PROPOSAL 930 (Stella?)

Players on Hold Eternally
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 870 by adding the paragraph:
A Player who is On Hold for a period longer than three months,
is deemed to have left the Game and shall be removed from the list of
Players. If the former Player re-enters the same Game, it shall be
with the same score as when e left and e shall not be considered a
new Player. Otherwise, e shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

[Changes the status of a Player who seems to be On Hold eternally]

[ Speaker's Note:  Egad!  You beat me to it! ]

====

PROPOSAL 931 (Stella?)

Cure 725
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 725 by replacing

"On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
who holds Stock X."

by

"The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the Player
(or Players) who holds Stock X."

[Cures an ambiguous phrase by something hopefully less ambiguous]

SCORE REPORT 27/4-5/5

At 5/5 there is a winner, a Game end and a Points to Marks Conversion.
And there should be a new Stock Auction.
Banker, please take note.

Note that I counted the votes cast for the Black Repeals.
I did this although they were withdrawn, as we have Jurisprudence
for just this situation.

Proposal 826 and 834-837 were withdrawn by the Speaker and
it was later established (CFJ 122 and 129) that the votes cast
still give right to 1 Point each.

I realize that this, again, is a controversial decision.
But would you rather have me as new Speaker than the Player
who I claim won the next game? (Answer at the end of this report!)

Greetings,
the Scorekeepor.

Continuing to work on the scores, I noted that CFJ 142 corrected
my previous score report on that period (dated May 1)

In particular Seth's score as he begins to play was put by the
CFJ at 14.1. From my previous Score Report one can see that
14.1 is wrong as well. Seth should have 182/3 = 60.7

As I am still obliged to make my calculations according to the
Rules I feel I have to disregard CFJ 142.

The other problem is the Mark interest.
Dave B. should calculate this before I can take it into account.

Any comments? I have to say, I start to become rather confused...

SCORE REPORT 5/5-29/5

Assuming nobody disputes Bowen's win, all Players start with
zero Points and the Point Reserve is reset.
There are several notables features:

1) At May 9 Gary expressed the wish to become a Player.
Although Oerjan hasn't registered him yet, I did.

2) No Marks interest was paid in May.
While I can correct errors I am aware of, I haven't the
faintest idea how many Marks people have, especially since
there where two Game ends.
The moment the Banker notifies me of the Marks interest
for Monday 2, 9, 16, 23 and 30 May I will include them.

3) No Stock Dividend was paid on Fridays: the Banker should
hold a Stock Auction.

4) Three players went missing during May (see Rule 460)
While I figured out their names, I also suspect that at least two
of them contacted the Speaker during May.

5) For the first time Welfare was paid according to Rule 713.

6) I will issue a set of CFJ's to settle all disputable points.

Greetings,
the Scorekeepor.
