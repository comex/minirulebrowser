As a CFJ has ruled that Stella? is Ronald, there is no Stella? Stock

There was an error in the score report I sent last friday, covering the scores
as of last thursday. It appears that all transactions from Alice's marks
interest onward were not included. Also, Vlad's name was spelled incorrectly,
causing LANACS to think there was a new player, OVLAD.

Previous scores from before Ian's joining the Game:

Rulekeepor's Note: The last time I sent out the Ruleset, Oerjan's
mailer split each of my three parts into two more parts.  In an
effort to avoid this, I have now split the Ruleset in 5 parts.

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 5

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

[Note:  I have annotated some Rules to clarify their interpretation.
However, these annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.

========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 201 (Mutable)
Quorum

201.

      Quorum for a proposed Rule Change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that
      Proposal.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 355 (Mutable)
Determining When a Rule Has Been Broken

355.  Determining when a Rule has been broken:

      If a Player believes that any Player has not abided by a Rule
      then in effect, in the form in which it was then in effect, then
      the Player may invoke Judgement on a Statement to that effect.
      However,
        -The Accusing player immediately loses 5 points.
        -No Player may be so Accused of actions committed before the
         adoption of this Rule or more than 30 days before the
         Accusation.
        -No Player may be so Accused more than once concerning the
         same committed act, unless the last such Accusation has been
         judged UNDECIDED.
        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      convicted of breaking the Rule.  If the Statement is judged
      FALSE, the Accused Player has been acquitted of breaking the
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.
      
      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 405 (Mutable)
No Vacations for Officers

405.  No Vacations for Officers:

      No Officer may be 'On Hold' while holding an Office.  If a
      current Officer should place himself On Hold, he is assumed to
      have resigned without appointing a successor, and the Office
      should be re-filled in the normal manner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over Rule 386.

========================================

Rule 406 (Mutable)
Clerk of the Courts

406.  Clerk of the Courts, Part I: Definition of Office:

      There shall exist an Office "Clerk of the Courts", who shall
      have general responsibility over administering Calls for
      Judgement, as outlined in the Rules.  The active Clerk of the
      Court may never be selected as a Judge.

      As a salary for carrying out his duties, he will receive 5
      points at the end of every seven days he is in Office, counting
      from his assumption of the Office.

      The initial holder of this Office shall be the Player who
      submitted this Proposal.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.

      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 454 (Mutable)
Declaring Proposals

454.  Clarity of Proposals:

      All Proposals must declare what effect that Proposal will have
      on the Rule Set. If said Proposal has a Title, this Declaration
      shall appear on the line immediately below that Title. In any
      case, the Declaration shall appear in parentheses. The
      Declarations shall be as follows:

         (Creates a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a new
            Rule to come into existance.
         (Amends a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to change wording or form.
         (Repeals a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes an
            existing Rule to cease to exist.
         (Transmutes a Rule) shall be used if the Proposal causes a
            Mutable Rule to become Immutable, or vice versa.
         (Other) shall be used if no other Declaration has been
            defined which describes the Proposal.

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

Injuction--Retracting an Illegal Move

665.  Specific Injunctions, part I

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)
To Disobey an Injunction is Criminal

669.  Contempt of Court

      If the rules require a Player to obey an Injunction and e fails
      to do so, then a Criminal Court may find that Player GUILTY of a

      recent Clerk of the Courts. A tentative replacement shall be
      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      require the Clerk of the Courts to fill a vacant Office of Clerk
      of the Courts.

Rule 710 (Mutable)
Criminal Court

710.  Criminal Court Amendment

      If a Player has been formally Accused of a Crime and that Player
      denies that a Crime was committed, or the Accused Player does
      not respond to the Accusation within 72 hours, or within 72
      hours of the time that the Accused Player ceases to be On Hold,
      should e be On Hold when the Accusation is made, then the
      Accusing Player may call for Criminal Court. To do so, the
      Accusing Player shall notify the Clerk of the Courts of the
      intent to begin Criminal Court and shall send a copy of the
      Accusation to the Clerk of the Courts.
      A Judge is then selected exactly as in the case of a call for
      Judgement, and Players are notified exactly as in the case of a
      call for Judgement, except that the reasons for the Guilt of the
      Accused need not be distributed to all Players, only the
      Accusing Player, the Accused, and the Crime. When a Judge has
      been finally selected, the Clerk of the Courts shall notify the
      Accusing and the Accused Player of the identity of the Judge.

      As soon as the Accused Player, who shall be known as the
      Defendant, and the Accusing Player, who shall be known as the
      Prosecuter, have been notified of the identity of the Judge who
      has accepted the appointment, they shall both send all pertinent
      information regarding this Crime to the Judge. When each party
      has sent all information, they shall indicate so by explicitly
      stating such in their last message to the Judge. The Judge then
      has one week from the time at which both such messgaes have been
      recieved to return a Verdict, following all Rules exactly as if
      returning a Judgement in the case of a call for Judgement. The
      Judge shall not return a Verdict until at least 72 hours after
      the identity of the Judge is announced so that other interested
      Players can also send information to the Judge.

      A Verdict may be GUILTY, NOT GUILTY, or UNDECIDED. If the
      Verdict is GUILTY, then the Defendant shall suffer all the
      penalties relevant to the Class of Crime of which e was found
      GUILTY. If the Verdict is NOT GUILTY, then there shall be no
      effect. If the Verdict is UNDECIDED, then it shall be as if
      there had been no Criminal Court.  A Criminal Court may be
      Appealed exactly as a Call for Judgement may be Appealed,
      except that all information pertinent to the Court shall be
      given to all involved in the Appeal, and if the Appeal OVERRULES
      the Verdict, then the process of a Criminal Court shall occur
      again automatically.
      If other Rules designate another Appeals system for a Criminal
      Court, those Rules shall take precedence over this Rule.

      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

Starting Points and No Unpermitted Point Changes

726.  Initial scores

      All Players begin with 0 Points, except that new Voters who
      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.
      This Rule applies to the Stock of Players that have left the
      game before adoption of this Proposal.

Conversion of Points to Marks at Game End

732.  Conversion into Marks at game end:

      When a Game ends the Points of all Players with a positive score

      Mark.  The number of Marks necessary for this conversion shall
      be created.

Rule 733 (Mutable)
Default Rules for Officers

733.  Default Rules for Officers

      An Official is any Player who has been Appointed or Elected to
      an Office specified in the Rules. A Judge is not an Officer.
      An Officer may be replaced by another Player, by a Proposal
      stating so, and that Proposal passes.
      An Officer may resign at any time, provided e appoints a
      successor.
      If an Officer resigns while a Proposal is being voted upon to
      replace eim, the Player proposed will by eis Successor.
      This Rule applies to general Offices, and therefore defers to
      Rules for specific Offices.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

Rule 747 (Mutable)
Definition of a Conserved Quantity

747.  Definition of a Conserved Quantity

      An Entity is only a Conserved Quantity if a Rule explicitly
      states such. A Conserved Quantity may only be Created or
      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      lines in that Proposal. In addition, any lines which are
      required by legislation, including a Title or a Declaration,

      be selected by the designated Sweepstakes Officer, and the Voter
      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week
      shall begin on Monday at 12:00 am and shall last seven days,
      until Sunday at 11:59 pm, in the time zone in which the
      designated Sweepstakes Officer resides. The weekly drawing

      1.  If the last line of text of the Rule begins with '(*' and
      ends with '*)' then the characters '/@' shall be inserted
      immediately before the final '*)'.
      2.  If the last line of text of the Rule does not begin with
      '(*' and end with '*)' then the following line of text shall be
      appended to the text of the Rule:  '(*Was: @*)'.
      3.  After clauses 1. and 2. above have been applied, the '@'
      which appears in the last line of text of the Rule shall be
      replaced with the Number of the Rule which was Amended by the
      Amending Proposal.

Spelling and Grammar Errors

754.  Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning

      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",

      determined by an Auction, this Auction shall be conducted by an
      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and
      may incude a negative number of Points.  This Rule takes

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This

      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor

      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is

      time.  "PL" is the Proposal Limit, which is defined to be 15.

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of

      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of
      that Nomic Week or the previous one.  In any Nomic Week
      in which Foreign Policy activity occurs, the Ambassador
      shall receive a salary of two (2) Points.

      Upon any change in the position of Speaker, the Office
      of Ambassador shall devolve to the new Speaker.  Except
      for this provision, the Office is chosen as described
      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.

      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
      the following legal Declaration:

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means
      not broadcast to the Public Forum.  Further, it shall be

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

========================================

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Rule 767 (Mutable)
Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Rule 779 (Mutable)
Sanity

779.  Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or
      less than once.

Rule 781 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

781.  Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum.  Within 48
      hours of the posting of this Formal Apology, the Squealer must
      either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Apology be accepted,
      or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's Aplology be rejected,
      but not both.  No other Player may submit such a Proposal, and
      the Squealer may submit only one.  If a Proposal to accept the
      Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject the Apology passes,
      then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

      or otherwise changing the account of any Nomic Entity's holding
      of Points or any other form of Currency based on the Vote they

Rule 785 (Mutable)
Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is
      considered to have Abandoned.

      Clerk of the Courts
      Rulekeepor
      Distributor
      <all other Officers in descending Point order>
      <all other Voters in descending Point order>

      When a replacement Speaker is required, all Players who are
      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list
      of succession, out of those who indicated a willingness to
      become Speaker, shall become Speaker.

Rule 789 (Mutable)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This

      There may be no more than PL Proposals up for Vote at any given
      time.  "PL" is the Proposal Limit, which is defined to be 15.

      The Speaker shall enforce this by delaying the distribution of
      Proposals in excess of this number. This Rule takes precedence,
      when permitted, over other Rules which require sooner
      distribution.

      If Proposal "Schemes" exist, then for the purpose of the
      Proposal limit, a Scheme shall count as a single Proposal.

      least PL/2 additional submitted Proposals. However, e may not do
      this until at least 24 hours after the Proposal queue was last
      closed. As soon as this notification appears on the Public
      Forum, Players are prohibited from submitting any more
      Proposals, and the Speaker shall refuse to accept any which are
      inadvertently submitted.

      When the number of Proposals up for Vote has dropped to PL/2 or
      below, the Speaker shall announce that Proposals are once again
      being accepted. After this appears on the Public Forum, Players
      may again submit Proposals.

      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
      shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
      also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC.

      (*Was: 510*)

========================================

Rule 799 (Mutable)
Additional Declarations

799.  Amend Declarations

      There shall be additional legal Declarations which are as
      follows:

         (Award a Patent Title) shall be used if the Proposal does not
            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Appeal by Proposal) shall be used for Proposals which seek
            to overturn a Judgement.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.
      (*Was: 650*)

========================================

Rul 803 (Mutable)
Quantum Marks--0.01

803.  Marks Granularity

      All Marks transfers between Game Entities must be in multiples
      of 0.01 Marks. Furthermore, whenever a quantity of Marks is
      changed, that quantity is immediately adjusted by rounding to
      the nearest .01 Mark.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would permit a
      different granularity of Marks.

========================================

Rule 804 (Mutable)
Mandatory Stock Liquidation at End of Game

804.  Liquidation of Stock at End of Game

      At the end of a Game, all Stocks will be returned to the Bank to
      be Auctioned upon the start of a new Game.

      Each Player that owned Stock (as of the end of the old Game)
      will be compensated to the amount of one half of the Marks paid
      by that Player for eis Stocks.  The Marks for a given Stock
      shall be drawn from the account of the Player to which the Stock
      corresponds.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing ownership
      of Stocks.

========================================

Rule 805 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

805.  Defined Partial Ordering of Actions

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, email correspondence of a purely
      discussionary nature is excluded from the ordering requirement,
      and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.

========================================

Rule 806 (Mutable)
Speaker Performs Duties of Vacant Offices

806.  Provide For Vacant Offices

      While an Office is vacant, and until it is filled as provided in
      other rules, the Speaker shall fulfill the duties of that
      Office.  The Speaker may delegate those duties to a willing
      Player if e desires.

      This Rule applies to Offices in general, and defers to the Rules
      for specific Offices.

========================================

Rule 807 (Mutable)
Non-Rule-Change Proposals

807.  Non-Rule-Change Proposals

      Proposals may be made which do not contain Rule Changes.  The
      permissible forms of Non-Rule-Change Proposals (or NRC
      Proposals), and the Declarations needed to propose them, shall
      be defined in other legislation.

      NRC Proposals are Voted upon and treated exactly like other
      Proposals, and shall be Numbered exactly like other Proposals.
      Upon the Adoption of a NRC Proposal, it shall take effect with
      results as described in the Rule or Rules that define the form
      of the Proposal in question.

========================================

Rule 809 (Mutable)
The Ambassador

809.  The Ambassador:  Conduct of Foreign Policy

      There shall be an Office known as the Ambassador.  The
      Ambassador shall have the sole power to conduct Foreign
      Policy.  Foreign Policy is defined as interacting with
      other Nomic Games in an official capacity, and/or 
      participating on behalf of the Players of this Nomic
      Game in any Central Nomic Game to be created.

      The Ambassador shall report to the Public Forum once a
      Nomic Week on any new Foreign Policy developements of
      that Nomic Week or the previous one.  In any Nomic Week
      in which Foreign Policy activity occurs, the Ambassador
      shall receive a salary of two (2) Points.

      Upon any change in the position of Speaker, the Office
      of Ambassador shall devolve to the new Speaker.  Except
      for this provision, the Office is chosen as described
      in other Rules.

      Proposals may be submitted directing the Ambassador on
      how to conduct a single piece of Foreign Policy business.
      Such Proposals are automatically Sane, and if passed are
      binding upon the Ambassador.  If the Ambassador acts
      contrary to such a Proposal, e may be charged with a 
      Class C Crime.  Such Proposals are submitted with the
      the following legal Declaration:
         (Foreign Policy Directive)

========================================

Rule 815 (Mutable)
Send Stuff Directly to Officers

815.  Proper Distribution

      Let all messages, information, requests, statements, CFJs,
      answers, etc. that Rules indicate are to be sent or delivered to
      a specific Office or Officer be sent directly to them.  

      Instances where a Player breaks this rule are to be ignored by
      said Office or Officer until e receives the message thru means
      not broadcast to the Public Forum.  Further, it shall be
      considered a Class A crime to send such a message to the Public
      Forum without first sending it to the proper Office or Officer.

      It shall be a Class A crime for an Office/r to respond to such a
      message if it was not sent in the proper manner.

========================================

Rule 816 (Mutable)
Title of Originator

816.  Title of Originator

      Let there be a Patent Title known as Originator.  This Patent
      Title shall be given to Chuck.  No other person shall hold
      this Patent Title at any time.

========================================

Rule 822 (Mutable)
No Coercive Proposals

822.  Stop the Insanity

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience are disallowed. For the
      purpose of Rule 106 or its successors, such a proposal is
      considered not to be "proposed in the proper way".

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which would
      otherwise allow such a shameful Proposal to be voted on.

Here are the next set of Proposals in the Proposal Queue.

Have fun,
Speaker jeffrey s.

====================
Proposal 851 (Garth)

One Player, One Vote
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 206 is Amended to read:

Each Player shall have exactly one Vote.

[ Why *shouldn't* the Speaker have the right to Vote?  I can see the
rationale in the Original Set;  there, the Speaker is sort of a super-
Officer, handling all game records.  But as things stand now, the position
is really no different from an Office:  The Speaker is the Officer who
collects and tabulates Votes and distributes Proposals.  A few other
things too, of course, and a few twists on choosing the Office, but
that's mainly it.  Nothing but tradition dictates that the Speaker
cannot Vote.  For that matter, perhaps we should think about paying a
regular Salary, and getting rid of the Marks award.  This would have
the added benefit of bringing Marks closer to being a truly conserved
quantity. ]

=============
Proposal 852 (Oerjan)

Mandatory actions are not crimes
(Creates a Rule)

It is never a Crime for any Player to perform an action which is
required of em by the Rules. This Rule takes precedence over any
Rules defining what is or is not a Crime.

============
Proposal 853 (Oerjan)

Code of honor
(Creates a Rule)

In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.

E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty of
a Class C Crime.

No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.
===================
Proposal 854 (Garth)

The Yes-Man
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be an Entity known as the Yes-Man.  The Yes-Man shall
have one Vote for each Proposal.

As soon as possible after the start of each Nomic Week, the
Yes-Man shall be sold in an Auction for Marks.  The Auctioneer
shall be the owner of the Yes-Man.  If the Auction is not
completed by the end of the Nomic Week, the Yes-Man shall be
considered to have been sold to the current highest bidder.
In any event, ownership of the Yes-Man shall not be transferred
before the end of the Nomic Week.  Any Marks paid for the
Yes-Man shall be placed in the Bank.

While a Player owns the Yes-Man, it shall cast its Vote on each
Proposal in precisely the same manner as its owner.

The first owner of the Yes-Man shall be the Bank, and the Auctioneer
of the first Auction for it shall be the Banker.

=========================
Proposal 855 (Garth)

Marks are Conserved
(Creates a Rule)

Marks are a Conserved Quantity.  The total number of Marks
is Public Information.

[ This is the first step in creating a truly stable Marks
economy.  The next two Proposals will further this aim. ]

=========================
Proposal 856 (Garth)

Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part I
(Creates a Rule)

Any Proposal which introduces a new way to Create or Destroy
a Conserved Quantity shall require at least three times as
many FOR Votes as AGAINST Votes in order to pass.  This
restriction does not apply to Proposals which define new
Conserved Quantities or Create the initial stock of a new
Conserved Quantity.

[ Ensures that no C.Q.'s enter or leave the system without
everybody's consent.  Thanks to Jeffrey S. for the idea of
requiring unanimity rather than an outright ban.]

=========================
Proposal 857 (Garth)

Conserved Quantities Really ARE Conserved, Part II
(Creates a Rule)

Any Player who makes a Proposal which eliminates ways of Creating
or Destroying a Conserved Quantity shall receive 10 Points from the
Point Reserve upon that Proposal being Adopted.  This award shall
not be given for Proposals which eliminate the only Rule describing
a particular Conserved Quantity or which eliminate the Rule that
Creates the initial stock of a Conserved Quantity.

[ This gives an incentive to patch up the ways that C.Q.'s are
currently Created or Destroyed (assuming that Marks are made a
C.Q.) without being dictatorial about it. ]

Subject: OFF: P823-P828 (fwd)

=========================
Proposal 823 (Jeffrey S.)
Marks Conversions
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 732 to read:
At the end of each game let each Player that did not win have eir
points be converted to Marks in a ratio of 50 points to 1 Mark.
The winner's points shall be taken away and e shall not receive
any Mark's compensation for eis points.

Marks for these conversions shall be awarded from the bank as
directed by the Ruleset

[This gives a slight hinderence to a Champion until eis term as
Speaker is over (at which point e is paid).  It would stop the 
addition of Marks to the economy that currently exists.  It 
encourages players to find methods to gain Marks rather than rely 
on the Ruleset to coddle them.]

Results: Passes 5-1-0
======================

Proposal 824 (Jeffrey S.)
Purchase of Points
(Makes a Rule)

Let all Players be able to buy points with eir Marks from the
Bank in a ratio of 20 points to 1 Mark.  Points will be received
from the Point Reserve for such transactions.

For such a transaction to be valid the Player must communicate
to the Banker that a point purchase is desired.  The player must
transfer only whole Mark amounts for such a transfer.  The Banker
will inform the Scorekeepor of transfer and the amount of points 
the Player is to receive from the Point Reserve.  The Scorekeepor
shall make the transaction public knowledge.

[This allows for a two way conversion between Marks and Points.
It allows for the Bank to receive Marks.  It also should meet all
the current legislation on disclosure.  It puts a loss on part of
the transaction that could be filled up by creative enterprise.
When combined with my other Proposal re: Marks it does not encourage
rampant trading to win the game, but does allow for a Player that 
has played for quite some time another method to win the game.]

Results:  Passes 9-5-0
====================

Proposal 825 (Jeffrey S.)
Vote AGAINST Without Recrimination
(Makes a Rule)

Proposals may affect the game when the effect/s is based on votes 
or activities before the passage of said Proposal only if said
Proposal was passed unanimously.

For the purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without 
receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

[This proposal stops walruses, bunnies, pork rinds, and table tops
from running amuck in eNomic, unless /no one objects/.  This means
that we can have fun, but obscure and troublesome Proposals can no
longer bother us for what was done /before/ we passed said Proposal
unless we want it too.  This Proposal closes the loop hole without
requiring a CFJ.  The potential for misuse and more troublesome
CFJs has been reduced because this Proposal addresses only those
Proposals that have a cause-effect relationship which begins before
the passage of said Proposal. (& I challenge Waggie to ensure the
passage of this proposal and still find away around it.-jsd)]

Results:  Passes 10-1-0
====================

Proposal 826 (Jeffrey S.)

Let the past be the same
(Makes a Rule)

Proposals may only affect the state of the game before passage of
said Proposal only if said Proposal receives a unanimous vote.

For the Purpose of this Rule, Proposals that are passed without
receiving any AGAINST votes are considered to be unanimous.

[Closes a loop hole that has been left dangling around.  I first
discovered when thinking about the Pesky Walruses (tm).]

Results:  Withdrawn
========================

PROPOSAL 827 (Waggie)
I Hate Bunnies!
(Creates a Rule)

When this Rule takes effect, each Nomic Entity which, at any
time, owned a Glad Bunny, shall have all of its Marks destroyed,
and shall be forbidden from owning Marks for the following six
full Nomic Weeks.  Each Nomic Entity which, at any time, owned a
Mad Bunny shall have 70 Points given to it for each Mad Bunny it
owned.

Proposals changing the value of an Entity's Score or Currency
Account, or its rights and priveledges in the conduct of the
Game based on whether or not that Entity ever owned a Walrus
are strictly prohibited, and shall not be deemed to have been
properly submitted.

[So there!]

Results:  Fails 3-4-0
===========================

Proposal 828 (Duane)
(Creates a Rule)

eNomic Beauty Contest

	Let there be created a Contest called the eNomic Beauty
	Contest.  Let the be designated a Judge who shall be the
	Speaker.  The Contestants shall be Voters who shall pay 1 Mark
	to the Prize Pot to enter the Contest.

	There shall be one (1) eNomic Beauty Contest held per eNomic
	Game.  The start of registering for the Contest shall start
	exactly one (1) week after the beginning of a new Game and
	shall last for 72 hours.  After the end of this 72 hours, the
	Judge shall notify the Contestants who have signed up to send
	descriptions of themselves or of close friends (Significant
	Others, family members, etc.) to the Judge so that the Judge
	can make a decision.

	After no less than 48 hours and no more than 96 hours the
	Judge shall post to the listserv the first, second, and third
	place winners along with their descriptions.  The first place
	winner shall receive 50% of the Prize Pot, the second place
	winner shall receive 30% of the Prize Pot, and the third place
	winner shall receive 20% of the Prize Pot.  The Judge shall
	receive 2 Marks for services rendered.

Proposal 838 (Jeffrey S.)

Think for Yourself
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 762 to read:
Upon any such occassions that a Player ceases to be a member of a
group, said Players shall receive that part of a group's treasury 
which is defined and allowed by the ordinances of said group.

If a group ceases to exist and the disbursment of the group's
treasury is unspecified the treasury shall belong to the Bank.
Once a group's treasury has been tranfered to the Bank no Nomic
Entity may excercise claim on the contents of said treasury.

[This encorages Players to have a group's ordinances be helpful
and comprehensive rather than cluttering up the Ruleset with
Rules that don't belog there.  If a group cannot reach concensus
and deal with this issue amongst its members I do not think that
the Ruleset should be used to settle its problems.]

Results:  Fails 2-4-1
--------

Proposal 839 (Jeffrey S.)

Office of the Assistant
(Makes a Rule)

Let there be an Office of the Assistant.  Said Office shall be
responsible for collecting those messages which are official in
nature from the Speaker ad Officers.  Messages are to be edited
into a single digest post.

The Assistant shall maintain previous digests and make them 
available upon request to any entity, including those Players on 
Hold.  This Rule shall take precidence over all other Rules 
regarding commuication with Players on Hold.

Results:  Passes 6-4-1
--------

PROPOSAL 840 (KoJen)
The Scamster
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as the "Scamster". This is awarded
to a Player who has shown great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in
the perpretating of Scams. This title is awarded by Proposal and once
awarded is permanent.

A Scamster must pay a one-time fee of 1 Point to the Point Reserve
upon receiving the Title. This fee is not optional, and the Patent
Title may not be declined.

[Justification: Although I do not condone the perpretation of Scams,
as I feel they are a distraction from more pressing issues, such
people deserve recognition. The 1 Point fee is a token amount, but
nonetheless serves as a reminder that Scamster is *not* an honor.]

Results:  Passes 8-3-0
--------

PROPOSAL 841 (KoJen)
The First Scamster
(Awards a Patent Title)

In recognition of several amusing Scams, the patent title of Scamster
is hereby awarded to Dave Wagner.

[Justification: Waggie deserves it more than any other current Player.]

Results:  Passes 7-4-0
--------
PROPOSAL 842 (KoJen)
The Most Titled Player
(creates a Rule)

Let there be a Patent Title known as "Most Titled". This Title is to
be given to the Player who has the largest number of Patent
Titles. The Registrar is charged with keeping track of this and
announcing when the Most Titled Player changes.
Results:  Passes 4-2-0

Submitted for your voting pleasure are the following Proposals.
Please note voting considerations for the last set of Proposals
submitted.

Humbly,  Jeffrey S.

------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 829 (Waggie)
Reward for Good Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 544 to read as follows:

When the Voting Period for a Proposal is over, the Proposer
recieves N  Points, where  N  is calculated as follows.  Let
F  be the number of Votes cast FOR the Proposal, and let  A
be the number of votes cast AGAINST the Proposal.  Then  N
is the greater of  F-A  and  -10  if  F-A  is negative, and
N is the lesser of  F-A and  10  if  F-A  is not negative.
(*Was: 544*)
-------------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 830 (Waggie)
Bodyguards
(Creates a Rule)

Any Player (A) may arrange with another Player (B) for B to
act as A's Bodyguard.  The amount of compensation and duration
of the arrangement may be anything mutually agreable to A and B.
The arrangement takes effect when both A and B have agreed to it
in the Public Forum, and the agreed-upon compensation has been
made.  A Player may have any number of Bodyguards.  A Player may
only act as the Bodyguard for one Player at a time.  It is the
responsibility of the Registrar to keep a record of these Bodyguard
arrangements.  While such an arrangement is in effect, no Coin of the
Group to which B belonged at the time the arrangement was made may
be used as payment for an Act of Mischief directed at A.  This Rule
takes precedence over other Rules which purport to determine when
an Act of Mischief is permissible, and which types of Coin may be
used as Payment for an Act of Mischief.
----------------------------------------
PROPOSAL 831 (Waggie)
Limit on Number of Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 791 to read as follows:

Each Player has the right to submit one Proposal in each Nomic
Week, but it is a priviledge to be allowed to submit more than
one Proposal in each Nomic Week.  Players may freely trade their
right to submit a Proposal in any given Nomic Week for any form
of compensation which they find acceptable.  Such a trade is
effected by a message posted in the Public Forum.

The Vizier of each Group is priviledged to submit up to three
Proposals in each Nomic Week.

[The Speaker does not oppose this proposal.  It is not contested.]
[Speaker's comment:  I am not forbidden or instructed to distribute
only those proposals that are submitted by those Players that follow
this Rule.  ie: Ian can submit 20 proposals and ignore both rights
and priviledges that this Proposal tries to bring about.] 
====================
Proposal 832 (Garth)

The Name of the Game
(Creates a Rule)

This Nomic Game shall be known by the name "phoenix".

[I've proto-proposed this twice and haven't heard any objections,
and some approval, so here it is.]
[Speaker's comment:  I don't like it, I also didn't see reason to
voice my opinion tho.]
===================
Proposal 833 (Garth)

Reward Successful Proposals
(Amends a Rule)

The last sentence of Rule 544 is hereby removed.

The following sentence is appended to Rule 544:

"However, only the Votes of Voters shall be counted for this
determination."

[This patches the infamous loophole in Rule 544.  In addition, it
ensures that Voters will not be penalized (or rewarded) for the
Votes of Groups and the Vototron.]
[Speaker's comment:  Timing is everything. :)  ]
=======================
Proposal 834-837 (Garth)

Overhaul of the Criminal Justice System
(Other)

Rules 600, 605, and 710 are hereby Repealed.

Rule 355 is amended in the following ways:

The following text is added after the first sentence:  "Similarly, if a
Player believes that any Player has commited a Crime, e may invoke 
Judgement on a Statement to that effect.  The term "Criminal Court" is
defined as a Judge of either of the above two types of Statements."

The second to last sentence has the following text added after the word
"Rule":  " or committing the Crime, as applicable."

The last sentence has the following text added after the word "Rule":
" or committing the Crime, as applicable." 

[Streamlines the Criminal Justice system.  Resolves Crimes via a mechanism
already in the Rules, that of Accusation.  Further, all the useful Rules that
happen to refer to a Criminal Court are retained.]

[Speaker's comment:  As this was submitted in a block and was not
seperated in any fashion, I shall be accepting only those votes for
this mess that are all FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.  Any other combination
will be considered to be either AGAINST or ABSTAIN, depending on
something yet to be decided. *sigh*  As there is a CFJ on this issue
currently pending one would hope that it would not be tried again.]

CFJ 119 (Garth)

*Submitted to CotC:  Thu Feb 24 23:01:03 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Alice

*Statement to be Judged:
Scorekeepor KoJen Moved illegally in omitting the Stock Dividends from
eis Score Report.

*Rationale given for CFJ:
Explanation:  Rule 493 states that the Scorekeepor "must abide by all
rules governing scoring".  Further, Rule 542 states that the Scorekeepor
must inform all Players when "any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule
changes".  Rule 463 defines the Score Report, and mandates that the
Scorekeepor make "eir best efforts to determine the correct scores".
Finally, Rule 725 states in no uncertain terms that upon Friday Noon
GMT of each Nomic Week, Stock Dividends are to be transferred between
Players.  Rule 725 thus "govern[s] scoring", and causes a "quantity
of Points" to "change".  Further, in ignoring an entire category of
eis duties, Scorekeepor KoJen cannot be argued to have made eis
"best efforts".  Therefore, the omission of the Stock Dividends was
illegal.  I have appended the text of the relevant Rules for the Judge's
convenience.

*Addendum to CFJ Request:
Request to the Judge:
I request that an Injunction be issued to include an accurate accounting
of the Stock Dividends in the Players' Scores.

Further, I will note that if the Statement is found to be TRUE, a Formal
Apology Injunction is mandatory.

Rule 493 (Mutable)
      There shall exist an Office known as Scorekeeper.

      The Scorekeeper is responsible for maintaining a list of the
      scores of all current players, making such a list available on
      request, and for notifying players in the event of a win on
      points.  He must abide by all rules governing scoring, but in
      cases where the rules are unclear or contradictory is to use his
      best judgement in determining scores.

      Salary:  The salary of the Scorekeeper is two points per week.

      Initial officeholder:  On passage of this proposal the Mighty
      Speaker becomes Scorekeeper.

----------------------------------------
Rule 542 (Mutable)
      Whenever any quantity of Points mentioned in a Rule changes, the
      Designated Scorekeeper shall notify all other players of said
      Point change and the reasons for it.

----------------------------------------
Rule 463 (Mutable)
      At least once in any seven day period, the designated
      scorekeeper shall send the current scores of all Players to all
      Players, making eir best efforts to determine the correct
      scores. If a Player feels that the posted scores are in error,
      e may make a Call for Judgement, stating what e believes to be
      the correct scores. If the resulting Judgement is TRUE, then the
      scores shall be adjusted to the scores set forth in the Call for
      Judgement, modified further by any score changes which took
      place since the time the Call for Judgement was made. If such a
      Call for Judgement is not made within seven days of the posting
      of the scores, then those scores shall be considered to be the
      accurate and actual scores for the Game.


-----------------------------------------
Rule 725 (Mutable)
      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

*CFJ 120 (David Bowen)

*Submitted to be Judged:  Tue Mar  1 14:54:57 1994

*The Judge shall be:  KoJen

*Statement to be judged:
   The Registrar erred in failing to consider the quantum mechanical
uncertainties when he performed his Walrus calculations.

*Rationale for CFJ:
Explanation: Even the Registrar agrees that in the 10^-100 sec lifetime of
the Walruses there is an immense uncertainty in the energy present. This
uncertainty in the energy (10^73 ergs) vastly outweighs the energy of a
Walrus in ground state (10^28 ergs) that any claim that only a single
Walrus was created in the interval is ludicrous.  Almost certainly there were
additional Walrus anti-Walrus pairs created along with more mundane things
like photons, pi mesons, and top quarks and their corresponding antiparticles.

*CFJ 121  (Waggie)

*Submitted to be Judged:  Tue Mar  1 16:07:10 1994

*The Judge shall be:  Chuck

*Statement to be Judged:
The Banker, by refusing to apply the effect of the short-lived
Walrus Rules to the Marks accounts of all Nomic Entities, is in
violation of Rules 101, 450, and 516.  

*Addendum to CFJ:
The Marks accounts of all Nomic Entities must be adjusted in 
accordance with the Walrus Rules and the Walrus Report submitted 
by the Registrar.

*Rationale and further addendum:
[Note:  it is completely intolerable that a public officer should
baldly try to simply ignore the rules.  He might not like my
little scam, but at least I used some style in karking up the Game.
The Banmker is doing no such thing.  When the Judge decides this
to be TRUE, I urge em to submit an Injunction setting the Marks
accounts straight, as well as the Formal Apology stuff!]

*Rationale for Judgement:
Regardless of what other Rules the Banker may have violated in
not applying the Walrus effects correctly, he did *not* violate
Rule 450.  Thus, the statement in this CFJ is false.

Let's review Rule 450, shall we?
=====
Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.
=====

Let's consider two different things: 1) the Marks themselves; and
2) the Banker's record of the Marks.

For each of these we must ask a) does Rule 450 apply?  and b) if so,
did the Banker violate Rule 450 by changing that entity outside
of the Rules?

1)  The Marks themselves.  a)  Does Rule 450 apply to Marks?  Of course.
b)  Did the Banker violate Rule 450 by changing the Marks?  No.  Although
the Banker's record might not correctly reflect the true number of
Marks, the Banker did nothing to change the number of Marks.  Again
(for what seems like the millionth time) I make the distinction between
Platonic (actual) game state and recorded game state.  Suppose, according
to the Rules, Waggie should have 25 Marks, but the Banker's records show
that Waggie only has 10 Marks.  We must keep in mind that in a case
like this, *Waggie has 25 Marks*.  Although the Banker's records
may be incorrect, this does not change the actual game state.  Thus,
Dave Bowen did not violate Rule 450, as he did not alter the number
of Marks of any player outside of the Rules, even if he did
alter his *record* of the number of Marks.

2)  What about the Banker's *records* of the number of Marks owned
by each player?  a)  Rule 450 does not apply to the Banker's records,
as these *do* have an existence outside of Nomic, i.e. either
in electronic form and/or hardcopy form somewhere.  To put it
another way, if we passed a Rule tomorrow ending the meta-game
of Nomic (*iryi* $azam Nomic, for those of you in frc ;),
the Marks would cease to exist along with the game, but the Banker's
records would not.

Thus, I find that Dave Bowen did not violate Rule 450, making the
entire CFJ false.  (Which makes my life easier, since I don't
have to decide whether or not he violated 516 and 101.)

Speaker jeffrey s.

=======================
Proposal 858 (Garth)

Sweepstakes and the Sweepstakes Pots
(Creates a Rule)

A Sweepstakes is a contest of luck or skill in which the Winner or
Winners are awarded Points or Currencies.  The Proposal Lottery is
a Sweepstakes; other Sweepstakes may be defined in other legislation.
Any Player or Nomic Entity which may own and trade Points or Currencies
may participate in any Sweepstakes, unless forbidden in other Rules.

For each Sweepstakes defined in the Rules, let there be an Entity
known as the <name> Pot where <name> is the name of the Sweepstakes in
question.  Pots may own Points and Currencies in exactly the same way
as Players.  The Sweepstakes Officer shall keep track of the amount
of Points and Currencies in each Pot, and shall report on the contents
of each to the Public Forum at least once a Nomic Week.

Sweepstakes are administered by the Sweepstakes Officer, who shall
announce the Winner or Winners of each Sweepstakes and the amount
Won to the Public Forum each time a Sweepstakes is Won.  Upon 
Winning, the Winners have the Points and Currencies in the Pot split
evenly between them unless legislation shall determine otherwise.  If
an even split cannot be made, the excess shall remain in the Pot.

Any random determinations needed to decide the Winner or Winners of a
Sweepstakes shall be made by the Sweepstakes Officer.

[ Creates a mechanism to add new Sweepstakes.  And lest anyone complain
that there are no Sweepstakes other than the Proposal Lottery, just you
wait.  :) ]

====================
Proposal 859 (Garth)

Son of Secret Word Sweepstakes
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a Sweepstakes known as the Secret Word Sweepstakes.

At the beginning of each Nomic Week, 5 Points shall be transferred from

Since Waggie seems to want to turn this into a personality war, I enclose a
copy of the message on which I acted.  Note the Received headers, they show
that this message transferred from math.uwaterloo.ca to cray.com and then
to fig.cray.com.  It went nowhere near any public forum.  Now the copy sent
to nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au may have gone into the public forum, but it
was received in a seperate message and ignored.

Here is my revised Proto-Proposal on Withdrawal.

                     Garth

===========================

Withdrawing Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

If a Player informs the Speaker at least one day before the end of
the Voting Period that e wishes to Withdraw a Proposal that was
submitted by eim, no further Votes on that Proposal shall be 
accepted.  All existing Votes on that Proposal shall be changed to
ABSTAIN, and shall not count as Votes for purposes other than 
determining whether the Proposal in question passed.

Upon Withdrawing the Proposal, the Player shall lose one Point for
each Vote submitted on it, or twice that amount if the Proposal had
not previously been discussed in the Public Forum before being
submitted.  These Points shall be given to the Speaker.  Further,
the Player shall compensate any other Players who placed Points in
the Vototron for that Proposal.

This Rule takes precedence over other Rules governing Votes and
Voting.

As per Rule 815, I recently sent the following to Jeffrey S.
I am reposting it here in the hope that it will encourage him
not to illegally "withdraw" the CFJ.  (Side note: anyone else
think that it's a bad idea to have the Speaker and COTC be
the same person?)

Message sent to Jeffrey S.:


I hereby call for judgement on the following statement:

Speaker Jeffrey S. violated Rule 208 by not distributing the results
of Proposal 826.

Argument:

Jeffrey S. claims to have "withdrawn" proposal 826, and he cites
Rule 116 as giving him permission to do so.  This is *not* permitted
by Rule 116, as such a "withdrawl" is in violation of other Rules.

Rule 106 states that all proposals proposed in the proper way shall
be voted on, while 693 specifies the voting period.  Rule 208 requires
the Speaker to post the result of the vote at the end of that voting
period.  Jeffrey S. did not do this.

There is no evidence that proposal 826 was not proposed in the proper
way.  Thus, it must be voted on for seven days, and at the end
of that time Jeffrey S. must post the results.  He did not do this.

Note that if this judgement is found to be TRUE, the Judge must issue
an Injunction as per Rule 781.  E may also issue the sort of Injunction
specified in Rule 665, and I would urge em to do so.  No doubt
Jeffrey S. (who proposed 826) saw a large number of AGAINST votes
coming in on his proposal, and decided he could avoid the F-A
penalty by withdrawing the proposal--a blatantly illegal action.
This time he has withdrawn his own proposal.  If we let him get
away with it, he may withdraw *your* proposal next time.

Relevant Rules and other Evidence:

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

Rule 693 (Mutable)
Prescribed Voting Period

693.  Voting Period Definitions:

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal shall be seven days,
      beginning at the time that the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

While the Rules would seem to permit the withdrawl of Proposals, it also
would seem to permit Voters to receive points based on how they voted
for withdrawn Proposals before they were withdrawn.

I list the Voters that voted on withdrawn Proposals and will let wiser
heads determine the outcome of this issue.
