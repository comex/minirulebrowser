Steve has called for Judgement.

In compliance with the various rules governing my position I have
randomly selected a Judge.

Judge: Ian <cabelljn@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu>

Statement:

The current scores are in error and should be adjusted as follows:

KoJen: -10
Michael: +5
Stella?: -11

(The numbers following the names represent additions/subtractions
to be made to whatever scores these players have, not their alleged
actual scores).

Argument:

The report of the Speaker to the ScoreKeepor concerning the voting results
on proposals 933-950 and the scores calculated from them is in error.
The Speaker misapplied Rule 833, in that he counted votes cast by the
Abelian Group and by the Vototron when determining the points rewards
due to the players who made proposals 933, 937, and 941-950 inclusive.
Rule 833 allows only votes cast by Voters to count toward these determinations.
If the Abelian Group and Vototron votes are discounted, the points
rewards due to the above 3 players for making their proposals differ
from those calculated by the Speaker as I have outlined. The precise
calculations are contained in a message I have already sent to the Public
Forum and which may be perused by the Judge at eir leisure.

Injunction:
If found true, I request the Judge to issue an Injunction under rule 663
changing the scores as I have outlined.

Note to prospective judges: It is my belief that Barring currently has no
legal force, and that attempts by the CotC to enforce it would technically 
invalidate this CFJ due to faulty judge selection procedures. Therefore I
have not Barred any player. It is my hope, however, that any player whose
score is affected by this CFJ and who is selected as Judge will decline
the honour.

********************

>From the CotC: if someone wishes to see the message that Steve refers
to above, I can supply copies.

Michael.

Chuck has called for Judgement on the Statement below. By the powers
vested in me, etc, etc, I have selected a random candidate to be
Judge.

Judge: Timothy Ferguson <Timothy.Ferguson@jcu.edu.au>

Statement:

Judge Coren's Injunction, in CFJ 158, that Rule 463 be annotated
with the statement in CFJ 158 and the list of relevant Rules, is in
violation of the Rules.

Argument:

Rule 789 permits Injunctions of this sort *only* when the CFJ "alleg[es]
that a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way."  CFJ 158 does not
allege that a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way.  It alleges
that Scorekeepor Stella? violated the Rules.  The arguments which caller
KoJen provided with the CFJ may allege that a Rule should be interpreted
in a certain way, but that is irrelevant here; the CFJ itself makes no
such allegation.

Evidence [CFJ 158, Rule 789, and Rule 663]:

Rule 789 (Mutable)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

789.  Injunction: Interpretation of a Rule

      When a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule should be
      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no
      longer applicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is
      Judged TRUE, the annotation shall be stricken from the rule set.

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

All rise, Court is now in session, Judge Timothy Ferguson presiding over 
the matter of CFJ#162.

I would argue, as a person, rather than as a Judge, that Legally 
Responsible only determines blame for error, it does not act as a bar for 
future corrections of that error.  This opinion is not directly relevant 
to the Judgement, but I ask that players give consideration to this 
opinion before the appeal proccess is invoked.

The section on which I base my Judgement is this one:

> 
>       A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
>       specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
>       must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
>       time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
>       addressed in the corresponding judgement.

The matter to be juded was criminality of the actions of the 
Scorekeeper.  The third section of the injunction was only broadly, not 
strictly, relevant to the case.  I agree that the injunction would 
probably have contributed to the smoother flow of activity in future, but 
it was beyond the power of the judge to alter the rules, in this case.

> 
>       If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does

>       to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the

The entire injunction, rather than the third portion, which was illegal, 
is therefore invalid.

In summary, I judge that the Caller's claim is legally TRUE, even though 
I wish it was not.  As a result of this judgement, the effects of all 
sections of the earlier injunction are void.

Timothy Ferguson,
Presiding Judge.

Each of the CFJ's quoted, and each of the CFJ's which were in the garbled
part of the message which is quoted above which were assigned to us, and
which furthermore are exactly the same except for the number of the CFJ
being referred to, we hereby Judge to be FALSE.

Reasons:

Rules 407 and 662 explicity say that to call for Judgement, the CFJ in
question must allege that a specific Move is illegal, or fit into other
qualifications. The CFJ's which these CFJ's refer to are indeed considered
to be specific Moves, and these CFJ's do indeed call the legality of those
Moves into question. Therefore, the CFJ's being referred to are indeed
legal to make, and therefore should no tbe retracted.

As these are the only Rules which we can find which refer to the subject,
we return our Judgement accordingly. It should also be noted that should
any other Judge find that the Rules are silent or inconsistant on the subject
of finding CFJ's to be illegal, we have just make a CFJ which now becomes
a part of Game Custom, and thus the precedent which we have set is to be
used as a deciding factor in such a situation before other considerations
are made.

Enjoy!

Michael send out CFJ 161 this morning and assigned Ian as Judge.
However, Ian seems to be On Hold.
I therefore assign another Judge.

CotC
=====
CFJ 161 Submitter: STEVE  Judge: JEFFREY

Statement:

The current scores are in error and should be adjusted as follows:

KoJen: -10
Michael: +5
Stella?: -11

(The numbers following the names represent additions/subtractions
to be made to whatever scores these players have, not their alleged
actual scores).

Argument:

The report of the Speaker to the ScoreKeepor concerning the voting results
on proposals 933-950 and the scores calculated from them is in error.
The Speaker misapplied Rule 833, in that he counted votes cast by the
Abelian Group and by the Vototron when determining the points rewards
due to the players who made proposals 933, 937, and 941-950 inclusive.
Rule 833 allows only votes cast by Voters to count toward these determinations.
If the Abelian Group and Vototron votes are discounted, the points
rewards due to the above 3 players for making their proposals differ
from those calculated by the Speaker as I have outlined. The precise
calculations are contained in a message I have already sent to the Public
Forum and which may be perused by the Judge at eir leisure.

Injunction:
If found true, I request the Judge to issue an Injunction under rule 663
changing the scores as I have outlined.

Note to prospective judges: It is my belief that Barring currently has no
legal force, and that attempts by the CotC to enforce it would technically
invalidate this CFJ due to faulty judge selection procedures. Therefore I
have not Barred any player. It is my hope, however, that any player whose
score is affected by this CFJ and who is selected as Judge will decline
the honour.

CFJ  663 Submitter: STEVE  Judge: COREN

Statement:

That if a CFJ includes a statement or allegation that a rule is to
be interpreted in a certain way, and the CFJ is Judged TRUE, then
that is sufficient to mandate Rulekeepor annotation of the rule
under Rule 789, so long as the allegation appears EITHER in the
statement to be Judged, OR in the Arguments supporting a statement
to be Judged.

Arguments:

Rule 789 states that a Judge may issue an Injunction to the RuleKeepor
to annotate a rule "when a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule
should be interpreted in a certain way" (and the CFJ is Judged TRUE
of course). This is ambiguous between the following two interpretations:

(i) that among the allegations a CFJ is held to make we should include
only those which appear explicitly in the statement to be Judged.

(ii) that among the allegations a CFJ is held to make we should include
all those allegations concerning the interpretation of rules which
appear explicitly in the CFJ document, including in particular the
reasons and arguments section.

The rules are silent on which of these interpretations is to be preferred.
I favour the latter, which a Judgement of TRUE will reinforce, on
grounds of (albeit slight) convenience. Consider as a case in point
CFJ 161, which alleges (in the statement) that the scores are incorrect.
It is subsequently seen (in the arguments) that this is due to the
Speaker having misinterpreted (or misapplied) Rule 833. If this CFJ
is Judged TRUE, it seems very natural to me that the correct
interpretation ought to be annotated in the Rules, without a separate
CFJ having to be made. Indeed, a separate CFJ might be dangerous, since
it might be Judged FALSE, leaving a rather confusing situation.

Injunction:

I request of the Judge that if e Judges TRUE that e issue an Injunction
to the Rulekeepor under Rule 789 to annotate Rule 789 accordingly, with the
following list of relevant rules:

Rule 789.
- -------------------------------------------------------------

(Now there's a pretty example of self-reference for you! I reckon this
ought to be Judged TRUE just so we can get the self-referential annotation
in the Ruleset :-)

Steve

Jeffrey gets 5 Points for Speedy Judgment.
(He sent his Judgment to the server *and* to me, unlike Timothy
this morning, who sent it only to the server.
Timothy, I advise you to reread Rule 815 and 408.)

CotC

[Comment of Stella?:
While this Judgment saves me work, in the sense, that I don't have to
redo the scores yet, I disagree strongly with it.

Nowhere in the rules does it say that the submitter has to provide all
the proof for his statement. By asking for the server log, Jeffrey
could have obtained the evidence himself.

I therefore think the Judgment is illegal: the matter can be decided
from the Rules and the log. IMO of course.

Well, I could be nasty and say: Hmm, the Judgment is illegal,
hence Jeffrey didn't send in a Judgment and doesn't get his salary,
before he does so.

But I hate to make waves, twice on one day....

Stella?]

PROTO-PROPOSAL XXX (Chuck)

On/Off Hold Messages directly to all Players
(Amends a Rule)

The first paragraph of Rule 870 is amended to read:

A Player may choose to be placed On Hold at any time by sending
a message indicating such to the Public Forum.  A Player may cease
to be On Hold by sending a message indicating such to the Public
Forum, so long as it has been at least 96 hours since e went On
Hold.

[A player going on/off hold notifies "the Public Forum."
In this way, only one message (public or private) is necessary.]

Alright, let's have some fun.

Cran hereby swear an Oath, for a period of one week beginning now, to
use only the first person singular pronoun "Cran" and its various forms,
instead of the usual English first person singular pronouns, in all messages
to the listserver and any official Nomic mail, except when quoting
another person.

Cran give examples of the various forms of "Cran" below:

Cran made that proposal.
That proposal was made by Cranf.
That is Crans proposal.
The proposal is Cran'l.
Cran was so mad when Cran realized Crans typo, Cran could have kicked
  Cransta!

Chuck (that's Cranf)

I've had an idea kicking around for some time, that I thought I would share.

If people like it, I'll write it up as a Proto-Proposal.

The idea is to have a document known as the Official Nomic Dictionary (or
Glossary, perhaps).

The raison d'etre for the Dictionary is that a LOT of room in the Rules is
taken up by definition of terms.  If these definitions were put elsewhere,
the Ruleset would be a good deal shorter and easier to read.

The Dictionary would have the force of a Rule, taking precedence over all
Mutables.  Creating a definition could be done by simple majority, changing
or deleting one by an Adoption Factor of 2, say.

As an example, see how I could have done my Adoption Factor package if there
were a Dictionary.

Definition 1:  Voting Factor:  The number of Votes in favor of a Proposal,
               divided by the number of Votes opposed.

Definition 2:  Adoption Factor:  The minimum necessary Voting Factor for a
               Proposal to be Adopted.  (See, 'Unanimity')

Definition 3:  Unanimity:  A special case of 'Adoption Factor' (qv.)  It
               consists of an absence of Votes opposed, with at least one
               Vote in favor of a Proposal.

Then the actual Rule is just:

Default Rules for Adopting Proposals
(Creates a Rule)

When the Voting Period for a given Proposal ends, the Speaker shall count
all Votes legally cast.  If the Voting Factor for the Proposal exceeds the
Adoption Factor, the Proposal shall be Adopted.  If the Voting Factor
exactly equals the Adoption Factor, the Speaker shall decide whether the
Proposal shall be Adopted or not.  Otherwise, the Proposal shall fail.

The Adoption Factor for all Proposals shall be 1, unless otherwise 
specified in the Rules.

========================

See?  A 7-line Rule, instead of a 15-20+ line Rule.

Plus, this would encourage us to nail down terms that haven't been.  Note,
that the basic term 'Nomic Entity' is defined *nowhere* in the Rules!

What do you think?

                           Garth

More on the Dictionary idea: The Rule which legislates the dictionary should
specify that terms which appear in Rules and which are defined in the 
dictionary should be specialy marked. Hence we might have:

A Rule is adopted if and only if the #Adoption Factor# exceeds the #Voting
Factor#.

This way, it's easy to see what's in the dictionary and what's not when
trying to understand what a rule means.

This comes quite close.
I wanted to proof that the CotC has the power to make a Player of eis
choice Speaker. I dislike the fact that Officers have so much raw power.

As it goes against my sense of fair Play to put the work involved on the
back of another Player, I asked Lance to transfer the CotC office to me
temporarily. Instead he prefered Michael (can't blame him....).

Michael needed about 40 Points more than the CFJ's assigned to him.
That's why I transfered the Points. (In advance, mind you!)

The attributions were, in fact, random as they should. I calculated
in advance how many CFJ's I would need so that a statistical fluctuation
in disfavour of Michael wouldn't kill his win.
Here are the number of CFJ's per person (all Active Players apart from
`CFJ submitter' Stella?):

ALICE      29
BOWEN      32
CHUCK      38
COREN      36
FNORD      35
GARTH      34
GREI       43
JEFFREY    40
MICHAEL    36
NICOL      37
SETH       35
STEVE      39
TIMOTHY    34
WES        32

You can see that Michael doesn't have the most CFJ's: in fact five
Players have more than him.

Thank you for the expression of confidence!

Greetings, from VAVAVAVOOM!

In the spirit in which this Group was formed, I present you with the
full, complete text of our Ordinances; there are no hidden rules,
policies, or calories!.  As the Statement of Intent in paragraph 1 should
make clear, the group exists for the sole purpose of being a transparent
mechanism for allowing those Players who do not feel an affiliation with
the stated agenda of any other Group to gain the second vote which
membership in a Group allows. 

If you are Unaffiliated, join this Group!  It costs you nothing, and gets 
you that vote.  If you belong to another Group, feel free to drop it and 
join us - why should you lose that vote just because you don't agree with 
your Group?  <g>

Our Ordinances follow.

Ordinancekeepor Coren

*****

Name: VAVAVAVOOM!

Initial Members: Chuck
                 Coren
                 Timothy Ferguson

Initial Set of Ordinances:

1.   VAVAVAVOOM! (Various Agorans, Via A Vizier, All Voting On
     Ordinary Measures) exists mainly for those who would otherwise
     not wish to join a Group, but still want the advantage of the
     extra vote which membership in a Group entails.  However,
     any Player is welcome to join the Group.

2.   Any Player may become a member of this Group by sending such a
     request to the Vizier.  Whenever the Membership of the Group
     changes, the Vizier shall inform all Members.

3.   If there is only one Member of the Group not on Hold, that
     Member shall be both Vizier and Ordinancekeepor.  If there is
     more than one Member not On Hold, than the Vizier shall be the
     first Member on the list below not On Hold, and the
     Ordinancekeepor shall be the second such Member.

     Chuck
     Coren
     Timothy Ferguson

4.   Each Member of the Group shall control one of the Group's votes
     on each Proposal.  In order to cast eir vote, the Member shall
     inform the Vizier how e wishes the Vote to be cast within the
     first four days of the voting period on a Proposal.  The Vizier
     shall then cast the Group's votes in accordance with the wishes of
     the Members.  If any Member does not indicate within the first
     four days of the voting period of a Proposal how they wish a Vote
     to be cast, then one of the Group's Votes shall remain uncast for
     that Member.

5.   Any proposed ordinance change (POC) requires a three-fourths
     majority of all Members voting to take effect, except that
     a change in the ordering of the list of Members in Ordinance 3
     requires only a simple majority vote.

6.   All POC's also require a quorum of 2 Members.

7.   At any time the list in Ordinance 3 may include only Group Members,
     and must include all Group Members.  Each Member's name must
     be listed exactly once.  POC's which would create
     inconsistency with this rule are improper and shall not take
     effect.

8.   In order to make a POC, it must be distributed to all Members.
     Votes on POC's must also be sent to all Members.  The Voting
     Period on a POC shall be one week; but it shall end earlier if
     enough YES or NO votes are cast to ensure a certain result.
     POC's that are passed take effect immediately at the end of the
     Voting Period.

9.   Certain changes are made to the Ordinances automatically,
     without need for a POC, vote, or quorum.  These are:
     a) When a new Member joins the Group, eir name shall be
        added to the end of the list in Ordinance 3.
     b) When a Member leaves the Group, eir name shall be deleted
        from the list in Ordinance 3.
     c) A Member may have eir name moved to the end of the list
        in Ordinance 3 by sending such a request to all Members.
        However, if this would cause the Vizier to change, the Member
        must give all other Members at least 3 days warning before
        doing so.

10.  As the group acts only as an agent for the players, any player
     who causes a loss from the group treasury must fully compensate the
     group for that loss, as soon as they are able.  If the treasury
     gains from the actions of a player, these gains must immediately be
     passed on to the player.  A player who leaves the group while e is
     either owed by or owes to the group will have the balance of his
     account with the group applied to eir share of the Treasury.

CFJ  664 Submitter: CHUCK  Judge: STELLA?

Statement:
"The item distributed by the Speaker as "Proposal 953" has no
effect on the Ruleset."

Arguments:

Rule 637 requires an amendment which inserts words to specify
where those words are inserted into the Rule.  Proposal 953 does
not do this.  Thus, proposal 953 is not properly proposed.  By
Rule 637, it should not have been voted on.  But too late: it has
been voted on.

Cran still argue that it has no effect.  Rule 106 states that
"All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
number of votes and Quorum is achieved."  ICO (In Crans Opinion)
"They" refers to "All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way."
Proposal 953 is not such a Rule Change.  Thus, Rule 106 does not
mandate its effect on the Ruleset.  Cran can find no other Rule
would mandate the adoption of an improperly proposed proposal;
thus, by Rule 116, which prohibits changing of the Rules except
when specifically permitted, proposal 953 does not affect the Ruleset.

Note: Cran do not allege, either in the CFJ or the argument above,
either that "Proposal 953" is a proposal or that "Proposal 953"
is not a Proposal.  ICO the CFJ should be judged TRUE either way;
if it is a Proposal, the argument above applies; if it is not a Proposal
it should be clear that it does not affect the Ruleset.


Evidence: ["Proposal 953", Rule 637, Rule 106, Rule 116]

PROPOSAL 953 (Ian)
Clean Up Vototron Rules I
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 574 to include the following paragraph:

      The Speaker is not allowed to make use of the Vototron.

Rule 637 (Mutable)
Form of Amendments

637.  Method of Amendment

      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or
      appended (if any). If a Proposal attempts to Ammend a Rule
      without following these guidelines, it shall not be considered
      to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

CFJ  665 Submitter: STEVE  Judge: GARTH

BARRED: KoJen, Michael, Stella? (This is legal since the passage of 951.)

Statement:
"The current scores are in error and should be adjusted as follows:

KoJen: -10
Michael: +5
Stella?: -11

(The numbers following the names represent additions/subtractions
to be made to whatever scores these players have, not their alleged
actual scores)."

Argument:

The report of the Speaker to the ScoreKeepor concerning the voting results
on proposals 933-950 and the scores calculated from them is in error.
The Speaker misapplied Rule 833, in that he counted votes cast by the
Abelian Group and by the Vototron when determining the points rewards
due to the players who made proposals 933, 937, and 941-950 inclusive.
Rule 833 allows only votes cast by Voters to count toward these determinations.
If the Abelian Group and Vototron votes are discounted, the points
rewards due to the above 3 players for making their proposals differ
from those calculated by the Speaker as I have outlined. The precise
calculations follow. First, Speaker Bowen's report:

Fiends, Romans, Agoramaniacs...

Lend me your eyes...

I, Timothy, Lord Ferguson, Grim Repealer, have discovered an eager, 
pupating Nomaniac here at my university.  He wishes to be known as the 
Scorekeeper, but failing that, I'd call him Paul.


Would the Registrar please register him?

Would the Vizier of VAVAVAVOOM! please send him our ordinances?

Would whoever has the phone book please send him them?

Would the Ambassador send me a couple of points, so that I can then 
extend the invitation of the Ambassador for him to join the game?

I'd better let him write some sort of request for registration to the 
appropriate authorities now, but if the Ambassador sends me a couple of 
points in the next 24 hours, he'll include a little message saying I was 
acting as the Ambassador's agent, so that the Ambassador still is given 
six(?) points...

Is this my first Scam, oh learned and devious fellow players?

Timothy.

	Dear Fellows (who/what ever you are),
		My name is Panayiotis Panayi, however due to the lack of 
Classical Greek speakers amoungst you (I presume few of you if any have 
fluency in this or even Old Testament Greek, nor even Modern Greek or yea 
even Cypriot (a Dialect of Greek)), please call me Mephistopheles.  As 
the more alert of you, or even those of you who are not as yet intellectually
or linguistically challenged, may have deduced from my E-Mail address, I 
am a law student...

Timothy Interrupts:

I've asked Paul (or, sorry, Mephistopheles) aboard to help with a 
collation of the legal system.  It will be something similar to what I 
did with the proposals rules.

	After beating Tim off my computer with my tobacco pipe, I now 
resume my letter... Yes...a law student in my final and honours year, 
specialising in Constitutional Law.  I hope I may be a useful member to 
this list (to myself at least or to any paying client//// friends).  As I 
usually charge hideous fees for letters sent and as I am not being paid 
for this one, I will end here.
		Yours Umberimae Fidae,
		Mephistopheles. 

   			ps

	Please do not under any circumstances refer to me under any of my 
relatives names or any cross cultural mythos demons.  By the By, I do a 
great deal in Contract Law especially Master - Servant or as we like to 
call them these days Employer - Employee relations.

Now that the Cat is away, the Mouse would like to dance on the table.

I proto-propose in the interest of circulating Marks:

PROTO-PROPOSAL     (Stella?)
The Marxist
(Amends a Rule)

Amend Rule 736 by adding at its end:
736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

No Player shall ever hold the Marxist title (even if attributed
anonymously) for a accumulated period longer than four weeks. E shall
take all necessary steps to prevent this from happening.

If a Player violates this rule, the Banker will take all but five
Marks away from this Player and distribute said Marks in equal parts
over all active Players.

Greetings,
Stella?

I would argue, as a person, rather than as a Judge, that Legally
Responsible only determines blame for error, it does not act as a bar for
future corrections of that error.  This opinion is not directly relevant
to the Judgement, but I ask that players give consideration to this
opinion before the appeal proccess is invoked.

The Inncunction to ammend is, in this case, outside that area in which
the Judge has authority.  He has been requested to adjudicate on the play
of the Scorekepper, not on the action of the rule.

Date: Tue, 26 Jul 1994 14:36:28 +1000 (EST)
From: Mr S L Gardner <gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au>

I have been asked to judge the following CFJs, submitted by Stella?. Each
claims that a CFJ, with a number one less than its own, was made illegally
and shall be retracted. I formally accept my appointments as Judge. Here
are my Judgements:

CFJ 164: FALSE
CFJ 170: FALSE
CFJ 175: FALSE
CFJ 188: FALSE
CFJ 198: FALSE
CFJ 219: FALSE
CFJ 264: FALSE
CFJ 267: FALSE
CFJ 271: FALSE
CFJ 312: FALSE
CFJ 313: FALSE

CFJ 357: FALSE
CFJ 364: FALSE
CFJ 398: FALSE

CFJ 455: FALSE
CFJ 462: FALSE
CFJ 478: FALSE
CFJ 538: FALSE
CFJ 554: FALSE
CFJ 577: FALSE
CFJ 590: FALSE
CFJ 592: FALSE
CFJ 595: FALSE
CFJ 613: FALSE
CFJ 620: FALSE
CFJ 646: FALSE

Reasons:

I can find nothing in the Rules which makes the making of these CFJs
illegal. Hence I judge that they should not (and shall not) be retracted.

Steve

From: Timothy Ferguson <Timothy.Ferguson@jcu.edu.au>

In the many, many, many, many matters that required judgement this
morning, I find that the matters are FALSE.  My reasoning is that
Judgements are to be considered to be legal, unless a reason is given why
they should not be considered so.

Therefore, without any reason as to why this repeal is necessary, the
matters are considered false.  Were they to have arrived individually,
perhaps I would have declared the matters undecided and asked for further
submissions.  As they appear to have been a rather obvious attempt to
draw the game closer to its conclusion by giving vast numbers of points
to each active player, I consider them a waste of time.  Irequest that
the person repsonsible not act in such a bandwidth wasting way again.

I will support rules to limit the ability of players to call for Judgement.

On an entirely different matter, I congratulate the new Speaker.

Timothy Ferguson.

Chuck provided me with a puzzler: he Judged all CFJ's (including
the ones that were not his), apart from a dozen or so that he declined.
Thanks to my editor, I arrive at:

Stella? receives 5 Points for the speedy Judgment of CFJ 664.

CotC

======================================
CFJ 664 Submitter: CHUCK  Judge: STELLA?

Statement:
"The item distributed by the Speaker as "Proposal 953" has no
effect on the Ruleset."

Judgment: FALSE

Argument:

Chuck's arguments can be summarized as:
An amendment which inserts words in a Rule has to specify *where*
those words are inserted, by Rule 637. Exhibit A -the lines of text,
that appeared on our screens labeled as Proposal 953- did not do so.
Therefore, if Exhibit A was ment to be a Proposal, it was obviously
not proposed in the proper way and should never have been distributed
and voted upon.

However, even so, it still has effect on the Rule Set!

The reason is Exhibit B, the Proposal distributed as 954.
I quote:

>PROPOSAL 954 (Ian)
>Clean Up Vototron Rules II
>(Repeals a Rule)
>
>If the Proposal titled "Clean Up the Vototron Rules I" passed
>then Repeal Rule 688.

If there would have been a proposal titled "Clean Up the Vototron
Rules I" and if it would have passed, then Exhibit B (which passed)
would not have to appear in the Rule set.

However, we know now that CUPtVR I doesn't exist, which implies
that 954 has to stay in the Rule set, until the time that such
a Proposal shall pass.

Summarizing: although Exhibit A does not change the Rules, its
improperness does have effect on the Rule Set and the statement is
FALSE.

References:
>Rule 637 (Mutable)
>Form of Amendments
>
>637.  Method of Amendment
>
>      If a Proposal seeks to Amend or Repeal a Rule, that Proposal
>      must refer to that Rule either by that Rule's number or by its
>      Title as given in the latest distributed Current Rule Set.
>      If a Proposal seeks to Amend a Rule, that Proposal must
>      explicitly state how in one of two ways: Either the Proposal
>      must restate the entire Rule, or the Proposal must quote the
>      phrases or words to be deleted (if any) and the phrases or words
>      to be inserted (as well as the location of such insertion) or
>      appended (if any). If a Proposal attempts to Ammend a Rule
>      without following these guidelines, it shall not be considered
>      to have been properly submitted, and shall not be Voted upon.

The auction for stock for all players is now open.  In response to
discussion on the list, I'm instituting a new procedure for the auction.
1) Every Player may submit a single Bid Message directly to the Banker.
   Bid Messages must be received within 80 hours of the sending of this
   announcement.
2) Each Bid Message shall consist of a list of individual bids ordered by
   Bidders preference. Individual bids larger than a Player's Bank account
   will be ignored, but the total of the individual bids may exceed the
   Bank balance.  In this case, the preference order will be used to settle
   bids.
3) As usual, bids must be in units of 0.01 Marks.
4) To ensure fairness, the Banker will not be participating in the Auction.

If you have questions, post them to the list and I will attempt to answer
them.

Stella? has expressed his displeasure with Jeffrey S.'s judgement
of UNDECIDED on CFJ 161.  This judgement seems to based solely on
the fact that the caller did not include all relevant information
with eir arguments.

Cran agree fully with Stella? that the ultimate responsibility
for finding relelvant information on a CFJ lies with the Judge.
Although it is considered polite for the caller to include all
relevant information, that does not absolve the Judge of finding
such information.  Should a Judge ignore a Rule relevant to a CFJ
merely because the caller did not provide the text of the Rule?
Absolutely not.

(Cran think it likely that there are others who agree with Cranf and
Stella?, although Cran do not know this for a fact.)

The question then remains, what to do about it?  A Rule to prohibit
this sort of thing would be difficult, at best, to word without
excluding proper judgements of UNDECIDED (the obvious solutions,
it seems to Cranf, would be too easy to get around).  If Honour
existed, this would no doubt be seen as a disHonourable act.  But
Honour does not yet exist.

Therefore, let Cranf suggest another kind of pressure:

Cran hereby swear an Oath that Cran will Bar Jeffrey S. from all CFJ's
which Cran submit from now until October 1, 1994.

Cran strongly urges other Players who share Crans disgust to make
a similar Oath.

Chuck

I am happy to introduce a prospective player to the game, currently
going by the name of Mephistopheles.  At this time e has placed demands
upon the Office of Ambassador that I shall not meet, but as he has
entered our domain to some extent I thought it best to introduce him.

Timothy has made a statement which indicated that he should receive
credit for for the recruitment of this potential Player.  As you can see
by the attached announcement, Mefisto has refused the credit claimed by
Timothy.

As Ambassador, I am unwilling to give Mefisto his desired 6 points, but 
I am personally willing to give 2.  Are any other players willing to give 
some points that he might be assausaged.

I would point out that he is willing to consider offers from various
groups that might desire him as a member.  I do not foresee that Albeian
will be expecially desirious, but I do not speak for the entire group,
and more significantly, it is not the only other group in Agora.

Humbly, jeffrey s.

Coren declined to be Judge for CFJ 663.
He looses two points, of which one goes to the CotC
The new Judge is Chuck.

CotC
====
CFJ  663 Submitter: STEVE  Judge: CHUCK

Statement:

That if a CFJ includes a statement or allegation that a rule is to
be interpreted in a certain way, and the CFJ is Judged TRUE, then
that is sufficient to mandate Rulekeepor annotation of the rule
under Rule 789, so long as the allegation appears EITHER in the
statement to be Judged, OR in the Arguments supporting a statement
to be Judged.

Arguments:

Rule 789 states that a Judge may issue an Injunction to the RuleKeepor
to annotate a rule "when a player makes a CFJ alleging that a Rule
should be interpreted in a certain way" (and the CFJ is Judged TRUE
of course). This is ambiguous between the following two interpretations:

(i) that among the allegations a CFJ is held to make we should include
only those which appear explicitly in the statement to be Judged.

(ii) that among the allegations a CFJ is held to make we should include
all those allegations concerning the interpretation of rules which
appear explicitly in the CFJ document, including in particular the
reasons and arguments section.

The rules are silent on which of these interpretations is to be preferred.
I favour the latter, which a Judgement of TRUE will reinforce, on
grounds of (albeit slight) convenience. Consider as a case in point
CFJ 161, which alleges (in the statement) that the scores are incorrect.
It is subsequently seen (in the arguments) that this is due to the
Speaker having misinterpreted (or misapplied) Rule 833. If this CFJ
is Judged TRUE, it seems very natural to me that the correct
interpretation ought to be annotated in the Rules, without a separate
CFJ having to be made. Indeed, a separate CFJ might be dangerous, since
it might be Judged FALSE, leaving a rather confusing situation.

Injunction:

I request of the Judge that if e Judges TRUE that e issue an Injunction
to the Rulekeepor under Rule 789 to annotate Rule 789 accordingly, with the
following list of relevant rules:

Rule 789.
- -------------------------------------------------------------

(Now there's a pretty example of self-reference for you! I reckon this
ought to be Judged TRUE just so we can get the self-referential annotation
in the Ruleset :-)

CFJ  666 Submitter: STELLA? Judge: WES

Statement:
"The distribution by Speaker David Bowen of the item labeled
`Proposal 953' was illegal.
The following adjustments to the Game State should be made:
-Ian's gain of 9 Points on this Proposal (+6 (F-A) +1 (short) +2 (proto)
shall be discarded;
-Ian's loss of 1 Point for the submission of 954, while 953 was up for
Vote, shall be discarded (as well as the resulting P.R. gain);
-All Proposals presently up for vote, as well as 954-960 shall have their
number decreased by one;
-Idem, for the Rules that resulted when some of these Proposals were or
shall be adopted;
-The debt of the Bank to Ian shall reflect his correct score."

Arguments:
Rule 637 requires an amendment which inserts words to specify
where those words are inserted into the Rule.  Ian's Proposal 953 does
not do this.  Thus, proposal 953 was not properly submitted by Ian,
and therefore not a proposed Rule Change in the sense of Rule 107.
Consequently, its distribution as Proposal 953 was illegal.

I don't think this is really a problem. I can't find any legal problem with
ratifying a new rule something like this:

PROPOSAL XXX
<All legal stuff here>

 1. All rules that are currently Immutable shall be hereby transmuted to
Mutable status.

 2. All rules, with the exception of Rule 101 and Rule 869, shall hereby be
repealed.

 3. Rule 000 shall hereby be enacted. (The text of Rule 000 follows.)


Rule 000:

 A Constitutional Majority shall be defined as two-thirds of the currently
registered Nomic Players. The game of Nomic under which this rule exists is
declared to be in a state of Constitutional Convention. This state shall
exist for a period of five weeks, unless at any time a Consitutional Majority
of players publicly declare that they favor an extension of 1 week. In that
case, the game shall be in the state of Consitutional Convention for an
additional week. The state may be extended by such declarations indefinitely.
 When the state of Constitutional Convention ends...
  ...if a new Ruleset exists and has been approved by a Consitutional
Majority, then the most recently approved new Ruleset shall take effect. Any
new Ruleset must explicitly tell how to determine the status of each player
with regard to any points, marks, or other information when the Convention is
over.
  ...if no new Ruleset has been approved, the state of the game shall be
reset to EXACTLY the state at which it was before Proposal XXX was ratified.

 During the Constitutional Convention, a new Ruleset shall be created. This
ruleset shall have NO power until it is ratified by a Consitutional Majority
and the Convention ends. This ruleset can be changed in any way by a simple
majority vote. These changes may refer to rules in the Old Ruleset, defined
as the ruleset before Proposal XXX was ratified. Rules in the (new) ruleset
shall be numbered in the following way:

Range         Topic

1000's General Rules (Game Name, etc.)
2000's Rules (Creating, Amending, etc.)
3000's Currencies (Marks, Points, whatever)

Other ranges can be created as needed, but any range should be relatively
specific.

-------------- (end of proposal)

Of course this is just my idea for numbering, any other scheme could be
implemented...

Subject: CFJ decisions

Decision:
I have determined that the following CFJs should be ruled FALSE.


Rationale:
They meet the requirement for proper CFJs as stated by the rules,
even though they do not follow a game tradition of a rationale to
support the statement.  Further, recent moves of a similiar nature
have been decided FALSE.

A Paradox CFJ. Wow! I didn't know they still existed.

CotC

====
CFJ667 Submitter: WES  Judge: STEVE

Statement:
"We claim a Win by Paradox, as per Rule 413. We claim that for us to send
a message to the listserv containing the word "Freakish" at any time
during the week following the Judgement of this Call for Judgement is
equally Legan and Illegal."

Our Arguments are as follows:

We have made an Oath to perform the aforementioned action, and another Oath
not to perform the aforementioned action. Both of these Oaths were sent to
Stella? in the same message as this Call for Judgement, and both Oaths
refer to the week following this Call for Judgement.

Rule 853, paragraph two, states: "If someone makes an Oath, e must do that
which e has sworn to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so."

As we have sworn to perform the aforementioned action, and have also sworn
NOT to perform the aforementioned action, and Rule 853 therefore requires
us to both perform, and not to perform this action, that the action is
therefore equally legal and illegal.

Therefore, we hereby claim that we shall Win by Paradox according to
Rule 413.

We would also suggest that the Judge consider that Rule 853 is the Rule
which is responsible for creating this Paradox, and point out that such
a determination would result in all Rules and explicit Game Custom to
be reset to immediately before Rule 853, NOT ending the Game. Although
Scores would be reset to 0, and all Proposals currently being Voted upon
would be discarded, Marks accounts, Titles, and other Game Entities should
stay as they are currently.


Enjoy!

For all X in the range 1 to 10000

{
        I hereby accept my role as judge for CFJ X.

        I hereby judge CFJ X False.

        As explanation of my judgement on this individual matter I offer
        the fact that I have been in contact with extraterrestrial beings
        from the pleiades who have insisted vehemently that were I to
        judge cfj X true it might mean the end of life as I know it ---
        I make my judgement in abject fear and urge my fellow earth

Cran judge this Statement FALSE.

While it is never explicitly stated in the Rules that Arguments
submitted by the caller of a CFJ have no legal force, it is clear--
both from elements implicit in the Rules and from Game Custom--
that those Arguments do not have any legal force.

1)  The Clerk of the Courts is *not* *even* *required* to distribute
such Arguments with a CFJ.  Rule 407 mandates only that the COTC
distribute the Statement and the identities of the Caller and Judge.

[Do not confuse these with the "Reasons and Arguments" of the *Judge*,
which are required to be distributed with the Judgement; and the
Rules explicitly state that these have no legal force.]

2)  Rule 451 clearly implies that a CFJ is to be Judged according
to the Statement alone.  Indeed, in the past CFJ's have been judged
TRUE even though the arguments supplied were incorrect; or they have
been judged FALSE do to a subtlety in wording, even when the arguments
presented were correct.

>From these Cran infer that, although it is never explicitly stated in
the Rules, it is both implicitly stated in the Rules *and* it is Game
Custom that arguments presented by the caller of the CFJ do not
form part of the CFJ itself.  Thus, an Injunction of the type
described in Rule 789 may be issued *only* when the Statement in
a CFJ alleges a certain interpretation of a Rule.

[Not to mention the pragmatic argument Cran pointed out before;
a Caller might allege an interpretation of the Rules in eir
Arguments which has nothing to do with the Statement.]

=====================

-The report does not yet take into account the issues that are `sub rosa'
notably the F-A question and the 953 question.
-Due to the game being won by Michael, Players start with zero scores,
and the P.R. is reset.
-A new player joined with an rather long nickname that my program
mercifully cuts to MEPH.

Why Wes' situation is *not* a paradox (well sort of)
Brought to you by the same folks who got you out of the Black
Repeals by twisted logic :)

Although Cran has not seen the actual Oaths, Cran gather
they are something like this:

1) Wes swears to post a message to the listserv with the word "freakish"
in the next week.

2) Wes swears not to post a message with the word "freakish" to the
listserv anytime within the next week.

Let's look at Rule 853:

Rule 853 (Mutable)
Oaths

853.  Code of honor

      In order to make an Oath, a Player must send a message
      to at least one other Player, stating the fact that they
      are making an Oath, and what the Oath is.

      If someone makes an Oath, e must do that which e has sworn
      to do, as long as it is legal for em to do so.
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      E who defies this has broken this Rule, and shall also be guilty
      of a Class C Crime.

      No rule may force someone to make an Oath;
      this rule takes precedence over all rules that attempt to do so.


Thus, we see that some Oaths are not binding; this is the case when
the Oath would require a player to perform an illegal action.  So
we have the question: are these two Oaths binding?

There are four possible cases:

Case A: Both Oaths are binding.  This is the paradox Wes presents in
his arguments.  But he ignores the three other cases.

Case B: Neither Oath is binding.  In this case it would be legal
for Wes to post said message, or not to post it.  But then both
Oaths require him to perform a *legal* action, and thus both Oaths
are binding.  Reductio ad absurdium.

Case C: Oath 1 is binding, but not Oath 2.  Wes is required to post
said message.  Oath 2 would require him not to post said message,
but then he would be breaking Oath 1 and in violation of Rule 853.
Since Oath 2 requires him to perform an illegal action, Oath 2
is not binding.  This case is internally consistent.

Case D: Oath 2 is binding, but not Oath 1.  Wes is forbidden to post
said message.  Oath 1 would require him to post said message, but
then he would be breaking Oath 2 and in violation of Rule 853.  Since
Oath 1 requires him to perform an illegal action, Oath 1 is not
binding.  This case is also internally consistent.

So Cases C and D are both non-paradoxical.  Which is it?  The answer is
clearly *not* that Wes gets to choose, which, because in that case,
it would be legal either to post or not to post, which is actually case
B.  The Rules are silent on this matter, as is Game Custom (this situation
never having arisen before).  So Cran would think that the Judge must
choose one or the other.

I did not notice this recent change; my apologies.

However, it does not change my stand, because your plan still calls for a 
"Success Pool", and I firmly do not believe that Honour should be able to 
be possessed by *anything* other than players, nor should any action 
within the game (excepting winning) call for a transfer of Honour.  
Honour should be for Player's expressing their pleasure or displeasure 
with the style of other Players, *only*.

You are measuring skill in the game in turns of completing one's stated 
Goals.  If you *must* implement this, let the reward (or punishment) for 
it be in terms of our measure of skill - points.

I swear an Oath that I will vote AGAINST any form of this proposal which 
involves the use or mandated transfer of Honour.

If Wes' Paradox CFJ is found TRUE, I will propose the following:

PROTOPROPOSAL XXX (Coren) (Protoproposed 7/28/94)
(Amends a Rule)
Defines precedence of Oaths

        Code of honour shall be amended as follows:

        The paragraph "If two or more Oaths conflict with each
        other, the Oath which was made earliest, as determined
        by the timestamps of the messages containing those Oaths,
        has precedence.  If more than one Oath is made in the
        same message, they shall be considered to be seperated
        by infinetesimal increments of time, and to have been
        made in the same order as they appeared in that message."
        shall be inserted between the third and final paragraphs.

[The reasons behind this one should be obvious.  Any comments on
whether there are any loopholes in my wording?  Also, Is this proto
in the mandated format?]

Here's a proto-Proposal to have the Vototron take Marks rather than Points.

Wasn't 574 Amended?  What's its Number now?


                       Garth

=====================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

The Vototron
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 574 is Amended in the following particulars:

All instances of the phrase 'Point Reserve' are replaced with the word
'Bank'.

All remaining instances of the string 'Point' are replaced with the
string 'Mark'.

[ Puts the Vototron on a Marks basis. ]

Protosproposal: Hardware (Timothy)
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a new nomic enity, called Military hardware, in units called 
legions.

Hardware is conserved, but new hardware is added each week, at the rate 
of two legions.

Hardware is auctioned as soon as it is created.

Players or groups may declare war, but only groups may be attacked in war.

Should a player or group declare war, thier legions shall be compared to 
those of the Victim.

If they are higher, both the attacking and defending legions are 
destroyed and the winner gains possession of 75% of the Treasury of the 
Group attacked.

When this rule comes into effect, there shall be two legions up for 
auction, and each group will have three legions.

Here's the Semimutables, one more time before I send them in.

Do people favor this, or Steve's more sweeping scheme?  I rather like
his, though he thinks a more incremental approach is desirable...

Nevertheless, this one will be difficult to Repeal afterward, being
Immutable.

=========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

Semimutable Rules
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be a class of Mutable Rules known as Semimutable Rules.
Proposals to Amend or Repeal Semimutable Rules shall have a base
Adoption Factor of 3.  All Semimutable Rules shall be marked as
such in any copies of the Ruleset mandated by the Rules.

Any Immutable Rule that is Transmuted to Mutable shall automatically
be Semimutable.

Rules may be made Semimutable (or non-Semimutable) by Proposal, as
delineated in other Rules.  However, Proposals to remove
Semimutability must have an Adoption Factor of at least 3.

======================

Proposal yyy (Garth)

Semimutable Rules
(Transmutes a Rule)

The previous Proposal, if Adopted, is hereby Transmuted into an
Immutable Rule.

Here's a few Proto-Proposal for two kinds of Decrees, to transfer Currencies and 
Points.  Should prove useful for correcting Scorekeeping errors, rewarding
people (or penalizing them), and for things like Creating new stocks of
Currencies and Destroying the Walrus Marks, which otherwise need Rules.

                          Garth

===========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

Transfer and Alteration of Currencies
(Creates a Rule)

Currencies may be Created, Destroyed, and/or be transferred between
Players and Nomic Entities, by means of a Decree.

Any amount of any Currency may be affected by such a Decree, and 
more than one Currency can be affected.  Further, the accounts of
any number of Players and Nomic Entities may be changed.

However, any such Decree that Creates or Destroys a Conserved 
Quantity shall have an Adoption Factor of 3.

This type of Decree need not be recorded, and is submitted with
the legal Declaration:

(Alters Currencies)

===========================

THE CURRENT RULESET

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.
 
========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.

Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,

      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.
      
      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.
      
      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

      for a length of time equal to the longest possible voting period
      on a proposal. At the end of this time, he is deregistered.
 
      During the time between forfeiting and being deregistered, the
      player may not vote or make a proposal.  The player
      automatically refuses any selection for judgement, or any other
      voluntary appointed duties.
 
      If, at any time during this period, the player announces that
      they have changed their mind about forfeiting, then these
      restrictions are instantly revoked, and the deregistration does

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this

          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.

      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.

      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed

      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in

      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement

      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the

      where X is the name of the Player.

      The Dividend on Stock X shall be 2 Points or 5% of the Points of
      Player X on Friday Noon GMT (whatever is more).
      The Dividend shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT to the
      Player (or Players) who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

936.  Proposal Discouragement, not Limit

      When a player submits a Proposal to the Speaker, e shall lose 1
      point for each Proposal proposed by em which either is currently
      up for Vote, or has been sent to the Speaker but not yet
      distributed.

      The Speaker is responsible for reporting this point change to
      the Scorekeepor, and the Speaker shall report it no later than
      the time at which the proposal is distributed.

      For the purposes of this Rule, multiple proposals in the same
      message shall be considered to have been sent to the Speaker
      separated by infinitesimal increments of time.

      If at any time after the adoption of this Rule there exists a
      Nomic entity known as the Point Sucker:
        --the "1 point" in the first paragraph shall be amended to
          "0.1 Marks"
        --the "Scorekeepor" in the second paragraph shall be amended

Rule 937 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

937.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Scorekeepor who
      calculates the dividends earned. However The Banker must notify
      the Scorekeepor of changes in the Stock ownership.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

Rule 938 (Mutable)
Ambassador Should Find More Players

938.  Find More Players

      The Ambassador is hereby directed to obtain new Players for
      Agora Nomic. For each new Player who joins at the invitation of
      the Ambassador and remains an Active Player for a full Game, the
      Ambassador receives 6 Points. The Ambassador is encouraged to
      share this bounty with the new Player. Responsibility for
      notifying the Scorekeepor is given to the Ambassador, who must
      make the notification within the next Game following the first
      full Game for which the new Player is registered. The new Player
      must mention that e was invited by the Ambassador before the end
      of the first full Game; this must be made to the public forum,
      or to the Registrar.

Rule 939 (Mutable)
Score Changes from True CFJ's

939.  More Point Changes Requested By Others

      Responsibility for detecting and reporting score changes
      resulting from a CFJ being judged TRUE is given to the Clerk of
      the Courts, who must notify the Scorekeepor as soon as possible,
      and no later than three days following the decision of the CFJ.

========================================

Rule 941 (Mutable)
Punishments for Crimes

941.  Punishment for Crimes

      If a Player is found Guilty of a Crime because a Criminal Court
      has indicated so, e shall lose Points as follows according to
      the Class of Crime of which e is Guilty of: Class A = 2;
      Class B = 5; Class C = 8; Class D = 15. If a Player is found
      Guilty of a Crime because that Player publicly admitted such, e
      shall lose Points as follows according to the Class of Crime
      which e is Guilty of: Class A = 1; Class B = 3; Class C = 5;
      Class D = 10.

      Responsibility for notifying the Scorekeepor of these penalties
      is given to the Clerk of the Courts, who must notify the
      Scorekeepor as soon as possible following the publication of the
      judgement finding em guilty; preferably at the same time as this
      publication, and absolutely no later than one Week.
      (*Was: 608*)

========================================

Rule 942 (Mutable)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

942.  Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, then a new Speaker is selected
      according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no such rules are
      defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
      becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in
      this case, and Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues
      until a Player Wins, at which time a new Game is begun and the
      Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker shall make
      reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials:
      proposal queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not
      possible, then the new Speaker shall request that these be
      resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is replaced in this
      manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
      where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the
      Game; this is the Scorekeepor's responsibility.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental
      illegal actions. The Judge of the CFJ *must* take these
      extremely tight standards into account, and the accused Speaker
      *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

========================================

Rule 947 (Mutable)
Bonus for Repeal

947.  Reduce the complexity

      When the number of Rules is larger than 100 any proposal that
      proposes to Repeal a Rule will earn its submitter a bonus of
      5 Points on adoption.

Rule 951 (Mutable)
Selecting a Judge

951.  Fix up Barring 

      Upon receipt of a Call For Judgement (CFJ), the Clerk of the
      Courts (CotC) shall randomly appoint a Player to be Judge
      excluding those on hold, barred from Judging said CFJ, calling
      for judgement, whose move is under judgement in said CFJ, or
      have declined appointment on this CFJ.

      Players may decline to serve on a particular case by notifying
      the CotC within 72 hours of appointment.  The declining Player
      shall not be eligible to serve as Judge for this CFJ and shall
      also lose two points, one of which shall be given to the CotC. 

      Upon receiving notice of a Player declining to serve the CotC
      shall randomly appoint a new Judge from eligible Player.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

955. Default Rules for Adopting Proposals

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker.  Let the
      number of Votes in favor of a Proposal divided by the number of
      Votes opposed to that Proposal be known as the Voting Factor for
      that Proposal.  If the Voting Factor exceeds the mandated
      Adoption Factor for a given Proposal, then that Proposal shall
      be Adopted.  If the Voting Factor exactly equals the required
      Adoption Factor, then the Speaker shall decide whether the
      Proposal shall be Adopted, or if the Proposal shall fail.

      The Adoption Factor for all Proposals shall be 1, unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules.  An Adoption Factor of
      unanimity is a special case:  It is defined as an absence of
      Votes in opposition, with at least one Vote in favor.

      then that Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker
      shall declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the
      Proposal.  A Contested Proposal shall have its Adoption Factor
      doubled.

Rule 957 (Mutable)
YES=FOR; NO=AGAINST; Anything else=ABSTAIN

957.  Legislative Custom

      Votes of FOR or YES are to be considered Votes in favor of a

      opposed to a Proposal.  Other Votes are not to be considered
      as in favor or opposition.

Rule 963 (Mutable)
Kudos and Honour

963.  Honour

      Let there be an entity called the Kudo (plural: Kudos).
      The amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eis Honour.

      Initially every Player holds 20 Kudos. New Players shall start
      with 20 Kudos as well. No Player shall have less than zero
      Kudos. No Player shall have a  non-integral number of Kudos.
      The number of Kudos held by each Player shall be kept track of
      by the Herald (an Officer) and published at least weekly.

      No more than once per Nomic week each Player may send a message
      to the Herald requesting the transfer of exactly one Kudo from
      one Player of eis choice to another Player of eis choice. The
      requesting Player may not eimself be the receiving Player.

      A Player who holds zero Kudos shall be known and addressed as
      `Honourless Worm' and shall address Players with more Honour as
      `Your Honour'.

      A Player who holds more than fourty Kudos shall be known and
      addressed as `Mighty Samourai' and may address Players with less
      Honour in any way e sees fit.

I don't know that it would be so much work.  I'd be willing to try
such a thing voluntarily for a while, to see if it would be practical.
Give me until next week, however, as I'm switching countries on
Wednesday.

I don't think it's really all that close to the Assistant's job either,
since the Assistant effectively archives official business so that it's
available verbatim for those who request it.  This new position would
be useful for those who go away for a week or two and want to catch up
without reading their 300+ messages, or simply as a reminder for active
Players.

    Player X will receive 5% of the sale price or 0.02 Marks,
    whichever is greater, from the selling Player.

Stock Reform III: Make Stocks yield Marks
(Ammends a Rule)
 
    Rule 931 is ammended in its entirety to read:
 
    "Let there be for each Player a Currency called X Stock,
    where X is the name of the Player.
 
    The Dividend on each share of X Stock shall be 0.05 Marks or
    2.0% of the Marks of Player X (whichever is greater) rounded to
    the nearest 0.01 Mark, calculated on Friday at Noon GMT.  The
    Dividend on each share shall be transfered on Friday Noon GMT

PROTO-PROPOSAL (Lance)
Stock Reform IV: Auction Procedure for Stocks
(Creates A Rule)

    The Auction of Stocks shall be done in the fashion of a Dutch
    Auction, described here.

    The Auctioneer shall announce the Auction as specified in other
    Rules, and proceed with the Auction as specified below.  E
    shall also announce that e will accept bids for a period of 1
    week from the Date: of the announcement.

    E shall then accept sealed bids for each share of Stock being
    Auctioned from each Player.

    If the Auctioneer wishes to bid, e must do so before processing
    bids from any other Player.

    At the end of the bidding period, the Auctioneer shall reveal
    the bids and dispose of the Stock(s) at Auction in the
    following manner.

    E shall dispose of the Stock(s) in order of highest bid to
    lowest bid.  For each share of X Stock, the Player or Players
    with the highest bid shall receive the share, and pay to Player
    X Marks equalling the next highest bid for that share + 0.01
    Marks.  If the high bidder does not hold enough Marks to pay
    for the share, the share shall be sold to the next highest
    bidder.

[ This is known as a Dutch Auction, and is used by the
  U.S. Treasury Dept. to auction off treasury bonds. ]

PROTO-PROPOSAL (Lance)
Stock Reform V: Issuing Additional Shares of Stock
(Creates A Rule)
 
    Once per Nomic Week, Player X, where X is any active Player,
    may transfer 1 Mark to the Bank and request that an addition
    share of X Stock be created and placed on Auction by the
    Auctioneer.

    The new share of X Stock is then Auctioned off according to
    the Rules governing Auctions of Stock.

[ This allows a Player to issue addition Stock in eimself in
  order to raise capital funds.]

PROTO-PROPOSAL (Lance)
Stock Reform VI: Redeeming a Share of Stock
(Creates a Rule)
 
     When Player X, where X is any active Player, owns a share of
     Stock X and there is more than 1 share of Stock X, e may
     redeem that share by notifying the Banker that he wishes to
     do so.  The Banker shall then transfer 1 Mark to Player X
     and make a public announcement that the share of Stock X
     owned by Player X has been redeemed.

The Paradox war, take II:

CFJ668  Submitter: CHUCK  Judge: COREN
Barred: Wes, Jeffrey S.

Statement:
"Rule 413 is entirely void."

Relevant Rules: 413, 105, 110, 111, 116

Cran request that the Judge, if e Judges this TRUE, issue an Injunction
of the type described in Rule 789.

Argument:

Cran here present not one but *two* arguments why 413 is "entirely
void;" Cran note to the Judge that if e determines that *either*
of these are correct, e must Judge TRUE; but the Injunction requested
is only appropriate if the *first* argument is correct, because the
list of relevant Rules above are those that apply to the first argument.

Argument #1:

Rule 413 may require that the Rules revert to the state they were in
at an earlier point in time.  This would most likely cause the effective
repeal of some Rules, possibly including the transmutation and/or
repealing of currently Immutable Rules (especially 895).

Rule 116 states that Rules may be changed only as specified in
the Rules.  Rule 105 lists types of Rule Changes.  While Rule 105
is most commonly applied to proposals, *it also limits any Rule
Changes which may take place*--including those enacted by
another Rule, as opposed to one enacted by an adopted proposal.
I.e. neither a proposal nor a Rule may change the Rules by any method
except those listed in Rule 105.

Thus, if 413 would cause an Immutable Rule to be repealed, this could
not be accomplished in a single step, but the Rule would first be
transmuted to Mutable and then repealed.

So we see that in either case--if 413 causes an immutable to be transmuted
or repealed--there is a transmutation of an immutable involved.

However, Rule 413 nowhere explicitly *states* that Rules shall be
transmuted; it is only implied that such would take place in the
reversion of the Rules to an earlier state.  This is in direct conflict
with Rule 110, which states, "Transmutation shall not be implied..."
By Rule 111, governing conflicts between immutable and mutable Rules,
413 is entirely void.

Argument #2:

If by some stretch of the imagination the above argument is incorrect,
Rule 413 is still "entirely void."  Rule 112 says that other Rules
may declare a winner only in two cases: 1) a win by points; or 2) a win
when play cannot continue.

Rule 413 attempts to enact a win by paradox, which clearly is not
a win on points.  However, it also describes how, if the Judge
declares a proposal X, play can continue.  Thus, Rule 413 attempts
to declare a winner on a basis other than points when play can still
continue.  This is in conflict with Immutable Rule 112.  By Rule
111, governing conflicts between Mutable and Immutable Rules, Rule 413
is entirely void.

Evidence: [Rules 413, 105, 110, 111, 116, 112]

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.

This is more flexible than the original, and just plain snappier,

the Precedence Rules with Mutability Indices in mind?

                     Garth

=========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

The Mutability Index
(Creates a Rule)

All Mutable Rules shall have associated with them a number known as
the Mutability Index.  The Mutability Index must be a finite number
greater than or equal to one;  unless otherwise specified by the
Rules, it shall be one in all cases.  Mutability Indices other than
one shall be indicated in all official copies of the Ruleset.

The base Adoption Factor for Proposals to Amend or Repeal a Mutable
Rule shall be equal to the Mutability Index of that Rule, and may
not be lower than that value.

Proposals to Enact Mutable Rules or Transmute Immutable Rules to 
Mutable may specify the Mutability Index of the new Mutable Rule.

The Mutability Index of a Rule may be changed by Proposal; however,
such Proposals shall have a minimum Adoption Factor equal to the
original Mutability Index of the Rule.

This Rule shall have a Mutability Index of 3; upon being Enacted,
this sentence shall be deleted from the text of this Rule.

Let there be a new nomic enitity called the Machine, which produces units 
of Hardware, the Nomic term for military units.

The Machine produces two legions, ground based units, per week, which are 
auctioned immediately.

If any group assails another group, then the number of attacking legions 
is compared to the number of defending legions.  The two groups determine 
wether to use all of thier legions in the war.  The side with the most 
legions wins the war.  The side with the least legions loses the war.  
Casualties are 100% on the losing side, of those legions commited to 
battle.  Casualties on the winning side equal casualties on the losing side.

If a group wins a war, they gain 75% of the treasury of the losing group.

There are forms of Upgraded Hardware, which are produced by paying half 
of the cost of a legion, to transform a legion already owned.

Armoured legions:  Which are counted as two legions apiece when 
determining the forces on either side.

Home defence legions:  Which count for triple only in defence, and may 
not attack.

Sabotuers:  If a sabotuer is sent to attack a group then it prevents one 
of the group's votes being cast on a given proposal.  The group is not 
aware of this until after the vote is finished.  This can be prevented by 
having a patrolling sabotuer.  If this is the case, the two sabotuers 
kill each other.  This whole sub-rule is administerd by the Speaker.

Coup Leader:  A coup leader transfers the ownership of one piece of 
hardware from the group it is attacking on its owners.  Coup leaders may 
not be used defensively.

Kamakazie:  A kamakazie kills five legions, but is itself destroyed 
and so cannot plunder an opposing group.

Here's something like what I had in mind. I think that instead of proposing
this as an official Office, I will just try doing it for a few weeks and see
how it goes. For right now, anyway, I'll do it as a free service. Please make
any suggestions or critiques or whatever you feel is appropriate.   

============================== The Digest, 7/30/94
==============================

* Coren swore an oath that e will vote against any form of a Goal proposal
which involves the use or mandated transfer of Honour.

* The debate is going on about Wes' claim to a win by paradox. Several people
have stated the opinion that, by Game Custom, the two oaths were made an
infintesimal amount of time apart, and that therefore only the first o
ath is binding. Wes disagrees.

* The newly created office of Herald is vacant. The Electioneer will be
conducting an election to fill the position.

* The 'Nomic Dictionary' idea continues to be batted around. There is some
debate over how much should go in the dictionary and how much should go in
the rules.

* Garth judged all of his CFJ's FALSE, including the 'scammy' ones along with
Steve's request for point changes. He called for appeal, since he was not
aware that he had been selected for Steve's CFJ.

* Chuck alleges in CFJ #668 that Rule 413 is entirely void. He presents two
arguments. The first revolves around the idea that Rule 413 would change the
Ruleset in a way forbidden by Rule 105. The second argument: Rule 112 says
that other Rules can declare a winner only by points or when play can't
continue. Rule 413 allows a player to make a win not based on points but with
play continuing. Coren is Judge.

* Coren proto-Proposed an Amendment to the Oath rule to define a precedence
of Oaths.

* ChrisM became a new Player.

* A position of 'Digester' has been suggested. Its function would be to
summarize each week's proceedings and debates and post a digest summary.

* Lance is Off Hold.

* Timothy proto-Proposed a new Entity called Military hardware. His
proto-Proposal states that any player or group may declare War on a Group.
The Hardware of the attacker and victim would be compared, and if the
Attacker's are higher then the Attacker gets 75% of the victim's treasury. A
few other suggestions have been made, including different kinds of Hardware
and elements of Chance. Wes seem especially excited about this, as they have
said several times.

* Garth proto-Proposed an amendment to the Vototron rule which would change
the currency accepted by the Vototron to Marks, instead of Points.

* Garth proto-Proposed a class of rules called Semimutables, which would have
to have an Adoption Factor of 3 to be Amended or Repealed. 

* Garth reposted the 'Semimutables' proto but in a new form. Each Rule would
have a Mutability index, which would serve as its necessary Adoption Factor
for repeal or amendment.

* Garth also proto-Proposed a new Rule for the transfer and alteration of
currencies by Decree.

* David Bowen proto-Proposed several amendments dealing with stock reform.

* Garth would like to know why people didn't approve his Limbo proposal.

A revamping of Mutability Indices.  The ability to change the Index
of a Rule is defined as a new Rule Change.  Unfortunately, this also
requires a Proposal to Amend 891 - yet it seems silly to define it as
an NRC Proposal.

Do you think that the abbreviations are a bit rampant in the first
Proposal?  They sure save a lot of space, but...

Oh, and is (Mutates a Rule) too cutesy?  I kinda liked it. :)

                     Garth

=========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

The Mutability Index
(Creates a Rule)

All Mutable Rules shall have associated with them a number known as
the Mutability Index.  The Mutability Index (MI) must be either a
finite number greater than or equal to one or Unanimity;  unless
otherwise specified by the Rules, it shall be one in all cases.
Mutability Indices other than one shall be indicated in all official
copies of the Ruleset.

The base Adoption Factor (AF) for Proposals to Amend or Repeal a
Mutable Rule shall be equal to the MI of that Rule, and the final AF
shall not be lower than that value.

Proposals to Enact Mutable Rules or Transmute Immutable Rules to 
Mutable may specify the Mutability Index of the new Mutable Rule.
However, such a Proposal to Enact shall have an AF equal to the 
Proposed MI.

=========================

Proposal yyy (Garth)

Changing Mutability Indices
(Creates a Rule)

The Mutability Index of a Rule may be changed by Proposal; however,
such Proposals shall have a base Adoption Factor equal to the
higher of the two Mutability Indices.

This type of Proposal is a Rule Change, and is submitted with the
following legal Declaration:

(Mutates a Rule)

=========================

Proposal zzz (Garth)

Only 5 Types of Rule Changes
(Amends a Rule)

Rule 891 has the following line added immediately beneath the line containing
the text: (Transmutes a Rule)

     (Mutates a Rule)

Here are three proto-Proposals to get the Dictionary off the ground!

                     Garth

==========================

Proposal xxx (Garth)

The Nomic Dictionary
(Creates a Rule)

Let there be an Official Document called the Dictionary,
to be maintained by the Rulekeepor.

The Dictionary shall contain lists of Defined Terms in
alphabetical order, along with their Definiitions.  The
Dictionary entry for a Defined Term may also include a
list of accepted synonyms of the Term, if any.

A Defined Term is a word or phrase with special significance
to the Game of Agora Nomic;  and the Definition of such a 
Term is a description of said significance.  Upon the entry
of the Terms 'Defined Term' and 'Definition' into the
Dictionary, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

The Definition of a Defined Term shall indicate the existence
of the Term and its attributes, if any.  It shall not include
any of the Term's abilities within the Game;  and any purported
Definition which does so shall be null and void.

Definitions shall have the force of Rules, and shall take
precedence over all Mutable Rules.  All instances of Defined
Terms in the Rules shall be capitalized.

====================

Proposal yyy (Garth)

Changing the Dictionary
(Creates a Rule)

Dictionary entries may be added, deleted, or altered by Proposal.
Any number of entries may be so affected by a single Proposal;
however, any Proposal which deletes the entry for a term in use
in the Rules shall have an Adoption Factor of Unanimity.

Entries to the Dictionary shall have the form:

Defined Term:  Definition, with subsequent lines being indented
     five spaces.  (List of accepted synonyms, if any.)

This type of Proposal is submitted with the following legal
Declaration:

(Changes the Dictionary)

[ I'm not sure if this should be a Rule Change or an NRC Proposal.
When I've figured it out, I'll add the info to the Proposal. ]

=========================

Proposal zzz (Garth)

Two Needed Definitions
(Changes the Dictionary)

The following entries shall be added to the Dictionary:

Defined Term:  A word or phrase with special significance to the
     Game of Agora Nomic.  Defined Terms appear in the Dictionary.
     (Term)

Definition:  A description of the special significance of a
     Term.

[ Naturally, this one would have to be made after the other two pass. ]

All of the following were submitted by Timothy.

They are also all repeals, and they were submitted with the
appropriate declarations, so in the interests of space, I will present
them in a more compact form. (The rules require that proposals be
submitted in such and such a form, but I believe that I am free to
distribute them in a more convenient fashion.) Anyway:

965: repeal 597
966: repeal 912
967: repeal 455
968: repeal 637
969: repeal 659

The voting period is a week. 

I hope to distribute another batch of five proposals this afternoon. 

Michael.
