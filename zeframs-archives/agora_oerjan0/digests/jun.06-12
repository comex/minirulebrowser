Bowen's win on May 5 depends on the existence of the Black Repeals
as Proposals that may be voted upon.
However they were thoroughly destroyed by CFJ 143 and the subsequent
Appeal rejection by Justice Garth and Justic Lance.
The Injunction to CFJ 143 obliges me (I think) to disregard my own
submissions and all of its consequences.
Hence no 330 Points for Stella?
Therefore Stella? doesn't win a Game, the scores are not reset and
the votes on the Black Repeals do not count. The latter means that
Bowen (who did vote) does not get the Points and doesn't win either.
>

I think not, at least not yet.

>Thoroghly confused now,

Me too. Do people agree that the above interpretation is correct?

>Still Speaker Garth, though not for much longer.

Right.

====
Other problems I have:
- are David N., Alice and Seth still registered? CFJ 149 would make me
think differently;
the question is important because it reduces the number of Players
*and* therefore the limit to win. (Surprisingly it would be yet another
Player who passes this lowered barrier.)

- when David N. submitted 907 without title I did not score the
class B fine against him, because 1) no Criminal Court convicted him
2) he hadn't confessed to the Crime.
However, Judge Nicol says in his arguments going with CFJ 150 that he did
confess to the Crime and that he was penalized.
The latter is not true, but do I have to interpret this statement as a
confession?????

Greetings,
Ronald

Given the current state of Speakership, I thought it appropriate to
re-protopropose the following mechanism for dealing with such situations:


protoPROPOSAL xxx (KoJen) (protoproposed 6/7/94)

Replacement of Impossible Speaker
(creates a rule)

If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play impossible by eir
actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not appealed within the allowed time,
then a new Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or if no
such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with the highest Score
becomes the Speaker.  This does not force the Game to be over in this case, and
Scores are not reset to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which
time a new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the Speaker. The new Speaker
shall make reasonable effort to obtain the former Speaker's materials: proposal
queue, voting records, etc., but if this is not possible, then the new Speaker
shall request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker is
replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N Points immediately,
where N is the number of Points required for a Player to Win the Game.

"Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic behavior, a
complete lack of interest in the Game, or uncooperativeness of the highest
order. It does *not* include normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by
past Speakers for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution, resetting of
scores, or the commission of Crimes or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into account, and the
accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity to defend eirself.

This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and takes
precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent this class of
Judgement.

[Justification: Someday we may have a Speaker so detrimental to the
Game that e must be replaced. We haven't had anything like this
yet. And we must not discourage individuality and leadership in our
Speakers by restricting them to excess; I don't want a Speaker
replaced due to simple unpopularity. To prevent "impossible behavior"
being used for strategic purposes, an extremely heavy penalty is
assessed.]


(To Garth: please don't assume that this proposal applies to you. It does
not. You certainly haven't demonstrated "overwhelmingly psychotic
behavior". However, I realize that other things may be going on in your Real
Life which makes it impossible to perform your Speakership duties in the
formerly excellent manner in which we are all accustomed. As it is difficult to
do much without a Speaker, I once again call upon you to either resign
Speakership or to designate a temporary spokesperson with the authority to
participate on your behalf, until such time as you are able to participate more
fully. We look forward to your eventual return.)

The Statement:

    "The Banker must auction the Stocks as we entered at least

**********************

The Judgement:

Ian judges this statement to be TRUE.

Arguments:

It seems clear that at least one game ended and at least one new one has
been started. Even if the Speakorship hasn't been transferred yet, our
scores have been set to zero, which is the way it is supposed to go. The
Bankor must auction the Stocks.

   While Ian's reasoning was correct based on the information available at
the time, the Scorekeepor has corrected his report since then.  Anyone care
to join me in an Appeal.

----------
The Statement:

    "The Banker must auction the Stocks as we entered at least
     one new Game since April 26."


**********************

The Judgement:

Ian judges this statement to be TRUE.

Arguments:

It seems clear that at least one game ended and at least one new one has
been started. Even if the Speakorship hasn't been transferred yet, our
scores have been set to zero, which is the way it is supposed to go. The
Bankor must auction the Stocks.

Status: OR

THE CURRENT RULESET
Part 1 of 6 

Rules are listed as follows, where NNN represents the Rule number:

========================================

Rule NNN (Immutable or Mutable)
My Own Unofficial Title

NNN.  Semi-Official Rule Title, If There Is One

      Text of Rule

Annotation: Some Rules are annotated as required by Rule 789.
These annotations "shall guide the interpretation
of that Rule."
Relevant Rules: Such annotations include a list of relevant Rules.

[Note: Some Rules are annotated by me to clarify their interpretation.
Unlike the official annotations, these are enclosed in brackets.
These annotations have no legal force in and of themselves.]

========================================



========================================

Rule 101 (Immutable)
Obey the Rules

101.

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

========================================

Rule 102 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Rules

102.

      Initially Rules in the 100's are Immutable and Rules in the
      200's are Mutable.  Rules subsequently Enacted or Transmuted
      (that is, changed from Immutable to Mutable or vice versa) may
      be Immutable or Mutable regardless of their Numbers, and Rules
      in the Initial Set may be Transmuted regardless of their Numbers.

========================================

Rule 103 (Immutable)
The Speaker and Voters

103.

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

========================================

Rule 104 (Immutable)
First Speaker

104.

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

========================================

Rule 105 (Immutable)
What Is a Rule Change?

105.

      A Rule Change is any of the following:  (1) the enactment,
      repeal, or amendment of a mutable Rule; or (2) the transmutation
      of an immutable Rule into a mutable Rule or vice versa.
        (Note:  This definition implies that, at least initially, all
      new Rules are Mutable; Immutable Rules, as long as they are
      Immutable, may not be Amended or Repealed; Mutable Rules, as long
      as they are Mutable, may be Amended or Repealed; any Rule of any
      status may be Transmuted; no Rule is absolutely immune to change.)

========================================

Rule 106 (Immutable)
Adopting Proposed Rule Changes

106.

      All Rule Changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on.
      They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required
      number of votes and Quorum is achieved.

========================================

Rule 107 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

107.

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

========================================

Rule 108 (Immutable)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

108.

      No Rule Change may take effect earlier than the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording
      explicitly states otherwise.  No rule change may have retroactive
      application.

========================================

Rule 109 (Immutable)
Rule Numbers

109.

      The Speaker shall give each proposed Rule Change a Number for
      reference.  The numbers shall begin with 301, and each Rule
      Change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next
      successive integer, whether or not the Proposal is adopted.
        If a Rule is Repealed and Reenacted, it receives the Number of
      the Proposal to Reenact it.  If a Rule is Amended or Transmuted,
      it receives the Number of the Proposal to Amend or Transmute it.
 
========================================

Rule 110 (Immutable)
Transmutation of Rules

110.

      Rule Changes that Transmute Immutable Rules into Mutable Rules
      may be adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among Votes
      legally cast.  Transmutation shall not be implied, but must be
      stated explicitly in a Proposal to take effect.

========================================

Rule 111 (Immutable)
Immutable/Mutable Conflicts

111.

      In a conflict between a Mutable and an Immutable Rule, the
      immutable Rule takes precedence and the Mutable Rule shall be
      entirely void.  For the purposes of this Rule a Proposal to
      Transmute an Immutable Rule does not "conflict" with that
      Immutable Rule.
 
========================================

Rule 112 (Immutable)
Winning Must Be by Points

112.

      The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered
      from achieving n points to any other state of affairs.  The
      magnitude of n and the means of earning points may be changed,
      and Rules that establish a Winner when play cannot continue may
      be Enacted and (while they are mutable) be Amended or Repealed.
 
========================================

Rule 113 (Immutable)
Players May Always Forfeit

113.

      A Player always has the option to forfeit the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse than
      losing, in the judgment of the Player to incur it, may be
      imposed.

========================================

Rule 114 (Immutable)
At Least One Mutable Rule

114.

      There must always be at least one Mutable Rule.  The adoption of
      Rule Changes must never become completely inpermissible.

========================================

Rule 115 (Immutable)
Rule Changes Which Change Rule-Changing Rules Allowed

115.

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

========================================

Rule 116 (Immutable)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

116.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly or
      implicitly permits it.

========================================

Rule 206 (Mutable)
One Voter, One Vote

206.

      Each Voter has exactly one Vote.  The Speaker may not Vote.

========================================

Rule 208 (Mutable)
End of the Voting Period

208.

      At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a Proposal, the
      Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that Proposal. If
      the Speaker's consent may be required for a Proposal to be
      adopted then the Speaker should indicate at that time whether or
      not e gives eir consent.  If the Speaker does not explicitly
      indicate that e refuses to consent to the Proposal, it shall be
      assumed that e consents.

========================================

Rule 212 (Mutable)
Resolving Rule Conflicts

212.

      If two or more Mutable Rules conflict with one another, or if
      two or more Immutable Rules conflict with one another, then the
      Rule with the lowest ordinal Number takes precedence.
        If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of rule) or takes
      precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.
        If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

========================================

Rule 217 (Mutable)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

217.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider Game Custom and the
      Spirit of the Game before applying other standards.

========================================

Rule 312 (Mutable)
A Point for Voting

312.

      If a Voter votes, he gets one (1) point at the end of the Voting
      Period.

========================================

Rule 376 (Mutable)
When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?

376.  Time that a rule change takes effect:

      An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the
      completion of the vote that adopted it.
      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

========================================

Rule 388 (Mutable)
Game Status When a New Game Begins

388.  Starting a new Game:

      Whenever a new game of Nomic is begun, the status of the new
      Game when it begins shall be the same as the status of the old
      Game when it ended, in all respects where the Rules do not
      decide otherwise.

========================================

Rule 399 (Mutable)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

399.  The Office of the Rulekeepor:

      Let there be an Officer known as the Rulekeepor.
      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of the current
      Rules, and post this list to all Players at least once a week.

      So long as the Rulekeepor is in Office, the Speaker is not
      required to maintain or distribute the Rules.

========================================

Rule 402 (Mutable)
Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker

402.  Transfer of Power of the Mighty Speaker:

      When one Mighty Speaker is yielding his Office to another, the
      following procedure shall be followed:
      
       1) The Present Mighty Speaker shall forward copies of all
          necessary materials for the performance of his Office to the
          Prospective Mighty Speaker.
       2) The Prospective Mighty Speaker shall acknowledge the receipt
          of said materials.
       3) The Present Mighty Speaker shall post a message to the
          listserv announcing the official transfer of power, which
          occurs at the "Date:" of the Present Mighty Speaker's
          posting.
      
      The Present Mighty Speaker remains in Office until the successful
      completion of step 3.

========================================

Rule 404 (Mutable)
Legality of Proposals

404.  Legality of Proposals:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

========================================

Rule 407 (Mutable)
Invoking Judgement

407.  Clerk of the Courts, Part II: Invoking Judgement:

      If Players disagree about the legality of a Move or the
      interpretation or application of a Rule, then a Player may
      invoke Judgement by submitting a Statement for Judgement to the
      Clerk of the Courts.  Disagreement, for the purposes of this
      Rule, may be created by the insistence of any Player.  When
      Judgement is invoked, the Clerk of the Courts must, as soon as
      possible, select a Judge as described in the Rules.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must then distribute the Statement to be judged,
      along with the identity of the Judge, to all Players.

========================================

Rule 408 (Mutable)
Accepting Judge-ship

408.  Clerk of the Courts, Part III: Accepting Judge-ship:

      After the Clerk of the Courts has distributed the Statement to
      be judged and the identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week
      in which to deliver a legal Judgement.  If the Judge fails to
      deliver a Judgement within this time, e is penalized 10 points
      and a new Judge is selected.  A Judgement is delivered by
      submitting that Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts, who must
      then distribute that Judgement to all Players as soon as
      possible.

========================================

Rule 413 (Mutable)
Winning by Paradox

413.  Winning By Paradox:

      If the Rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or
      if the legality of some action cannot be determined with
      finality, or if some action appears equally legal and illegal,
      then a player may Call For Judgement on a Statement to that
      effect.  If the Statement is judged TRUE, then the same Judge
      who judged the Statement TRUE must declare the most recent
      passed Proposal X such that the Statement was not TRUE before
      the passage of Proposal X, or declare that there is no such
      Proposal.  (Until the Judge does this, the Judgment is not
      valid.)  If the Judgement of TRUE is not overruled, then the
      Player who called for Judgement is declared the Winner of the
      game.
      
      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared that
      there is no such Proposal X, the game is ended, with no
      provisions for restarting it.

      When a Game ends by this manner and the Judge has declared such
      a Proposal X, the following actions are taken:
         - all Players remain active,
         - all Proposals curently being Voted upon are removed from
           consideration for Voting,
         - the scores for all Players are set to 0 (zero),
         - the Rules and explicit game custom are reverted to the
           state they were in before Proposal X was passed,
         - a Benevolent Speaker for the next Game is chosen:
              -If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the
               Benevolent Speaker, and the old Benevolent Speaker
               becomes a Voter,
              -If there is more than one Winner, the Benevolent
               Speaker randomly selects one of the Winners, who
               becomes the new Benevolent Speaker, and the old
               Benevolent Speaker becomes a Voter,
         - and a new Game is begun.

========================================

Rule 415 (Mutable)
How To Submit a Proposal

415.  "How a Proposal is Submitted":

      A Proposal by a Voter shall be made by submitting it to the
      Mighty Speaker. As soon as possible after receiving the
      Proposal, the Mighty Speaker shall assign the Proposal a Number
      and distribute the Proposal along with its number to all
      Players.

      The Mighty Speaker may also make Proposals. The Mighty Speaker
      must process all pending Voter-submitted Proposals first, and
      may then Process Proposals of the Mighty Speaker, assigning
      these Proposals a number and distributing them in the same
      fashion as any other Proposal.

========================================

Rule 417 (Mutable)
The Nomic Archivist

417.  Establishment of the Office of Archivist:

      That there be established an office known as the Nomic
      Archivist, which shall be governed by the default Rules
      concerning official posts. The initial duties of the Nomic
      Archivist shall be to record the passage and failure of
      Proposals, to maintain a "historical record" (defined below)
      of the Ruleset, to maintain a list of Judgements and their case
      histories, and to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.
      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as
      they see fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited
      from the historical material. Where the material being stored
      does not already admit a classification method, the Archivist
      is free to design one themselves.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the nomic
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

      The duties required of the Archivist may be changed with their
      consent and at the request of the Office's controlling body
      (whatsoever that may be). Initially, the controlling body of
      this Office shall be all Players, and any request to change the
      duties must therefore be supported by a majority of Players
      "speaking" to the request.  Naturally, default Rules for
      Offices may establish a different controlling body for this
      Office.

      The salary of the Archivist office shall be determined by its
      controlling body. Initially, its salary shall be 5 points and
      one coin of the office-holder's group per week.
      
      The initial office-holder for this post shall be Michael
      Norrish.

========================================

Rule 434 (Mutable)
Game May Be Won By CFJ

434.  Judgement Required to Win (and Timing of Win):

      If a Player believes that he has won the Game, he may submit a
      CFJ to that effect.  If it is returned with the Judgement TRUE
      (and that Judgement is not Appealed), then he has won the Game
      as of the delivery of that Judgement.  If the Judgement is TRUE,
      but is Appealed, but is sustained (and no Proposal to reverse
      the verdict is made), then he has won the Game as of the
      delivery of the Appeal verdict.  If such a verdict is sustained,
      challenged by Proposal, but the Proposal does not pass, he has
      won the Game as of the completion of the Vote on that Proposal.

      Judgement on a CFJ to win the Game may *not* be delivered until
      at least 72 hours after its official announcement, in order to
      give time for the Judge to accept input from the community.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      the exact moment at which a Game is won.

[Note: Implicit Game Custom dictates that, despite the title,
this rule does not *require* a CFJ in order to win the game.]

========================================

Rule 450 (Mutable)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

450.  Game Entities may not be Arbitrarily Changed:

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists only
      within the context of the current Game of Nomic, such as Points,
      Votes, etc. may *not* be changed by any action other than those
      specified by the Rules.

========================================

Rule 451 (Mutable)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

451.  Timing of CFJ Results:

      When a CFJ makes a Statement about the current state of the
      Game, the result of that CFJ shall be TRUE if and only if the
      Judge feels that that Statement was correct at the time that the
      CFJ was *issued*. Any changes that have happened in the time
      between the issuing of the CFJ and its delivery must be figured
      in to find the correct current state.

========================================

Rule 452 (Mutable)
Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker

452.  Prohibition of Electioneering by the Mighty Speaker:

      The Speaker may not use eis knowledge of the current status of a
      vote on a Proposal in an attempt to influence the result of the
      Vote on that Proposal. Violations of this Rule shall be
      considered a Class C Crime.

========================================

Rule 455 (Mutable)
Penalty for Improper or Lacking Declarations

455.  Further Declaration Rules:

      Any Player who submits a Proposal which does not include a
      Declaration, as described in other legislation, shall be guilty

610.  Default Rules for Currencies I: What is a Currency?

      Marks and Coins are Currencies.  Each type of Coin is a separate

      The number of each type of Currency owned by each player or

      which specifies a Recordkeepor for that Currency, then the
      Banker shall be the Recordkeepor for that Currency.

      This rule applies to Currencies in general, and thus defers to

========================================

Rule 724 (Mutable)
Winning the Game

724.  Requirements for Winning

      The Winner is the first Voter to achieve sufficiently many
      Points.  The minimum number of Points required for Player X to
      win is 10*N*(1+G/6), where N is the number of Players currently
      registered in the Game, and G is the number of Games which
      Player X has already won.  If more than one Voter achieves this
      condition simultaneously, then all such Voters win.  When a Game
      ends in this manner:
        - If there is only one Winner, that Voter becomes the new
          Speaker and the old Speaker becomes a Voter.
        - If there is more than one Winner, the Voter with the highest Point 
          total becomes the new Speaker.  If more than one Voter is
          tied for the highest score, the old Speaker randomly selects
          one of them to become the new Speaker.  The old Speaker
          becomes a voter.
        - All Player's scores are reset to 0.
        - A new Game is begun.  All Rules and Proposals retain the
          status they had at the end of the old Game.

========================================

Rule 725 (Mutable)
Stocks

725.  Timing of Stock point transfer.

      Let there be for each Player one Currency called X Stock,
      where X is the name of the Player.

      On Friday Noon GMT 5% of the Points of Player X (with a minimum
      of two Points) shall be transfered to the Player (or Players)
      who holds Stock X.

      At the passing of this Proposal the Bank has possession of all
      Stocks.  During the following week the Banker shall collect the
      bids in Marks.  Those bids have to be made by the Players
      (either alone or acting together on the same Stock) in a message
      to the server.  No bid shall be made, which can not be covered
      by the Marks in  he bidders Bank account (to be verified by the
      Banker.)

      After one week each of the Stocks shall be transfered from the
      Bank to the highest bidder. If two or more bids for Stock X are
      exactly equal, the Stock shall go to player X (if one of the
      highest bidders), or to the Player with the lowest score.

      If a given Stock X is bought by Player X, the Marks of the bid
      shall be transfered from Player X to the Bank.
      If a given Stock X is bought by another Player (or Players) then
      Player X, the Marks of the bid shall go from this Player(s) to
      Player X.

      The Banker shall keep track of the Stocks held by each Player.

========================================

Rule 726 (Mutable)

      enter part-way through a Game in progress shall be given the
      average of the scores of all active Players scores, not
      including those scores, which happen to be negative.
      Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as explicitly
      stated in the Rules.

========================================

Rule 728 (Mutable)
Destruction of and Compensation for Stocks of Leaving Players

728.  Stocks of leaving Players I

      When Player X leaves the game, Stock X shall be destroyed.
      If Stock X was held at that time by another Player, this Player
      shall be compensated with half the price in Marks that this
      Player paid for the Stock X.
      These Marks shall come from the account of Player X, *before*
      those shall be destroyed, as required by other Rules.
      If there are not enough Marks available, the deficit shall be
      paid by the Bank.

Rule 736 (Mutable)
The Marxist

736.  The Marxist

      Let there be the Patent Title known as "Marxist", which is
      awarded to the Player with the most Marks, or if tied, to the
      Players with the most Marks. Only the current richest Player
      or Players may hold this title.

      The determination and announcement of assignment and revoking
      of the Title is made by the Banker, who must use the most
      accurate means of determining this available to eim, and must
      make the announcement as soon as possible after becoming aware
      of a change in holder of the Title.

      However: To respect some Players' wish for privacy, and in
      view of the secret nature of Marks accounts, a prospective
      Marxist must first be asked if e wants the Title. If not, then
      instead of announcing, "Player x is granted the Patent Title of
      'Marxist', e announces, "Patent Title of 'Marxist' is granted
       to an anonymous Player".

      Destroyed as explicitly stated by the Rules. If a Conserved
      Quantity is given to an Entity, and no Rule states where that
      Conserved Quantity is to be taken from, then the transfer shall
      not take place. If a Conserved Quantity is taken from an Entity,
      and no Rule states where that Conserved Quantity is to be
      transfered to, then the Conserved Quantity shall be transfered
      to the Bank.

      who owns that Entry shall receive 1 Point per Entry by any other
      Player into the Lottery. For purposes of this Rule, a week

      ends with '*)' then the characters '/@' shall be inserted
      immediately before the final '*)'.
      2.  If the last line of text of the Rule does not begin with
      '(*' and end with '*)' then the following line of text shall be

      be awarded automatically, without need for a Proposal.

      If a Player Wins a Game despite a handicap factor X, then that
      Player shall instead receive the Patent Title "Champion*X",

      Player to Win, over the Points required for an unhandicapped
      Player to Win.

      Auctioneer, who shall be the Banker, the Banker's chosen willing
      delegate, or any other player as specified in other rules.
 
      Once the identity of the Auctioneer is determined, the Auction
      begins with the Auctioneer making an announcement to the game
      forum stating what  Nomic entity is up for Auction, and that e
      is accepting bids.
 
      Players who wish to participate in the Auction then must
      indicate their interest by sending a bid to the Auctioneer.
 
      The list of players who have indicated an interest is not
      secret, and if it is not included as part of the Auctioneer's
      Announcements the Auctioneer must share it on demand.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

761.  Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal: Adjusting for Abstentions

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Speaker. If a
      Proposal is not Contested, and there are more FOR votes cast
      then AGAINST votes, then that Proposal shall take effect.  If
      such a Proposal has an equal number of FOR and AGAINST Votes,
      then the Speaker shall decide whether the Proposal shall be
      Adopted, or if that Proposal shall fail. If the Proposal is
      Contested, and the number of FOR votes cast is at least twice
      the number of AGAINST votes cast, then that Proposal shall take
      effect.

      If a Rule will change the actions required of or forbidden to
      the Speaker, and the Speaker opposed the Proposal, then that
      Proposal shall be considered Contested. The Speaker shall
      declare if e opposes the Proposal when e distributes the

      Treasury as specified in the Y Ordinances.  If the Y Ordinances
      are silent on this issue, or if Group Y has ceased to exist,
      then 1/N times the contents of the Y Treasury, rounded
      downwards, shall be transferred to Player X, where N is the
      number of Members of Group Y immediately before Player X ceased
      to be a Member of Group Y.  This transfer is not taxable, and

Rule 764 (Mutable)
Mischief

764.  Mischief

      Any Player or Group X may perform an Act of Mischief directed
      at any Player or Group Y.  The permissible forms of Mischief
      are defined in other Rules; such definitions must include a 
      positive Price in Coins, or the form of Mischief is not
      permissible.  This Rule explicitly takes precedence over all
      other Rules which purport to determine which forms of Mischief
      are permissible.

      To cause an Act of Mischief,  X  sends to the Public Forum a
      message containing:
      - the Name of the object, Y;
      - the effect of the Act of Mischief;
      - the Number of the Rule which permits the form of Mischief;
      - indication of which Coins in X's account will be used as
      payment for the Act of Mischief.  Coins of Group Y, or the
      Group to which Player Y belongs, may not be used as payment.  

      The effect of the Act of Mischief is applied immediately upon 
      publication of the above message in the Forum.  An additional
      effect of this Act of Mischief is that
      - for each Coin of Group Z spent as payment above, two Points
      are removed from the Z Treasury;
      - the Coins used as payment above are removed from X's account
      and destroyed.

Rule 766 (Mutable)
Groups

766.  Amend Rule 714.

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two Offices
      are created known as the <name> Vizier, and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group.
      These Offices may never be empty, and the <name> Vizier and
      <name> Ordinancekeepor must both be a member of <name> Group.
      The <name> Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the
      Membership or the Ordinancekeepor of the <name> group changes.
      When the <name> Vizier changes, the new Vizier shall inform the
      Registrar of the change.
      The <name> Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and current
      record of the Ordinances of the <name> Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

      6.  The <name> Coins are a form of Currency which is created
      synchronously with the registration of the Group.  The <name>
      Group may create <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be
      placed in the <name> Treasury.  The <name> Group may destroy
      <name> Coins as it sees fit; these must be removed from the
      <name> Treasury.

Votes for Groups

767.  Amend Rule 646.

      If a Group has N Members then it has N Votes for each
      Proposal in addition to those of its Membership.  The
      Ordinances of a Group may determine how and when the Group
      casts its Votes; if the Ordinances are silent on this issue
      then the Group may not cast its Votes.  The Votes of the
      Group are cast when the Vizier sends a message to the Speaker
      to that effect during the Voting Period and this action is
      legitimate insofar as the Ordinances are concerned.

Sanity

      When a Player submits a Proposal, e may pay one Mark to the Bank
      (if e has at least one Mark) and impose Sanity on that Proposal.
      E must inform both the Banker and the Speaker when doing so.
      A Proposal which has Sanity imposed upon it is known as a Sane
      Proposal.  The Speaker shall, when e distributes a Sane
      Proposal, inform the Players that it is a Sane Proposal.

      No non-Voter Nomic entity may Vote on a Sane Proposal.  Each
      Voter shall have exactly one Vote on a Sane Proposal, and
      each Voter's Vote shall be counted exactly once on a Sane
      Proposal.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule allowing a non-Voter
      Nomic entity to Vote; over any rule which gives any Voter
      more or less than one Vote on a proposal; and over any
      rule which would cause any Voter's Vote to be counted more or

Abandonment of Speakerhood

785.  Improve Speaker Succession I

      If the Speaker has abandoned eir post, another new, Temporary
      Speaker is selected according to the "Rules of Succession", or
      if no such rules are defined, the other Player not on hold with
      the highest Score becomes the temporary Speaker.  This does not
      force the Game to be over in this case, and Scores are not reset
      to 0. The Game continues until a Player Wins, at which time a
      new Game is begun and the Winner becomes the real Speaker. The
      Temporary Speaker shall make reasonable effort to obtain the
      former Speaker's materials: proposal queue, voting records, etc.
      but if this is not possible, then the Temporary Speaker shall
      request that these be resubmitted by the Players. If a Speaker
      is replaced in this manner, e has eir score set to minus 2N
      Points immediately, where N is the number of Points required for
      a Player to Win the Game.

      Abandonment is determined as follows: If any Player suspects
      that the Speaker has Abandoned, e sends a message to all Players
      calling on the Speaker to announce eir presence.  The Speaker
      must reply to all Players within one week; if e does not, e is

      willing to become Speaker shall indicate such in a message, sent
      within three days of the Abandonment or resignation of the
      Speaker.  The old Speaker may not send such a message.  This
      message shall be sent to the Speaker, in the case of a Speaker
      voluntarily giving up his position; or to the first Player who
      called for the Speaker to announce his presence, in the case of
      an Abandoned Speaker.

      After three days, the Player ranking highest on the list

      interpreted in a certain way, e shall also submit a list of
      Rules relevant to that CFJ, which must include the Rule in
      question.  If the statement is Judged TRUE, the Judge may
      include with the Judgement an Injuction requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement in the CFJ
      and the list of relevant Rules.

      The annotation shall remain only until one of the Rules
      in the list of relevant Rules is amended, repealed, or
      transmuted; or until a CFJ determines that the injunction no
      longer applies, as described below.  While it remains, it shall
      guide the application of that Rule.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances which led to the
      Judgement no longer prevail and the annotation is therefore no

        -The following exception takes precedence over previous Rules 
         concerning Judgement: Neither Accusing nor Accused Player may
         act as Judge for the Accusation; in any case where this would
         occur, a random Voter, neither Accuser nor Accused, shall be
         Judge.
      If the Statement is judged TRUE, the Accused Player has been
      found Guilty of breaking the Rule or committing the Crime, as
      applicable.  If the Statement is judged FALSE, the Accused
      Player has been found Not Guilty of breaking the Rule or

903.  Point Changes Automatically Applied by the Scorekeepor, Part 1 

      Classes of Point changes which the Scorekeepor is Legally
      Responsible for detecting and tabulating without a specific
      request by another Player include, but are not necessarily
      limited to the following:

      * Salaries which consist of a fixed Point award per Week.

      * Transfers of Points specifically requested by the owner of the
      Points in a message received by the Scorekeepor.

      * Transfers of Points from a Group Treasury specifically
      requested by the Vizier of that Group in a message received by
      the Scorekeepor; however, the Vizier is legally responsible for
      ensuring that such a Point transfer is consistent with eir
      Group's Ordinances.

      * Point changes resulting from end of Game adjustments.

      * Point rounding, taxation and "Welfare", if mandated by other
      Rules.

      Game.

      * Point changes resulting from dissolution of a Group.

      * Point changes resulting from a premature transfer of
      Speakership.

      The Scorekeepor is Legally Responsible for ensuring that the
      above Point changes are performed according to all Rules.

      Additional classes of Point changes which are the Scorekeepor's
      Legal Responsibility may be defined by other Rules.

========================================

Rule 905 (Mutable)
No Point Changes if No One Reports Them

905.  Point Changes With Legal Responsibility Unspecified

      If a Rule mandates a change in Points, but no Rules exist which
      define the Player Legally Responsible for detecting and
      reporting the change to the Scorekeepor, then the Point change
      is cancelled.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing
      changes in Points, to the extent permitted.

========================================

Rule 906 (Mutable)
Who's Responsible for Point Changes

906.  Point Changes Requested By Other Players, Part 1

      The Legal Responsibility for detecting the following classes of
      Point changes and reporting them to the Scorekeepor is bestowed
      upon another Player:

      * All Point changes directly related to the submission of
      Proposals: responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no
      later than the message announcing the voting results.

      * All Point changes directly related to voting on Proposals:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from Vototron contributions:
      responsibility of Speaker, who must report these no later than
      the message announcing the voting results.

      * All point changes resulting from fees for judgements, salaries
      and penalties given to judges: responsibility of Clerk of the
      Courts, who must report these as soon as possible, and no later
      than the message announcing the outcome of the judgement.

      * Electioneer per-position-filled salary: responsibility of
      Electioneer to notify Scorekeepor within one Week.

      * Point changes regarding the "Squealer/Ninny" Rule: If the
      Ninny must lose Points, the responsibility lies with the
      Squealer for informing the Scorekeepor as soon as possible.

      * Marks interest: responsibility of Banker to nofify Scorekeepor
      as soon as possible following the mandated interst payment.

      * Proposal lottery: responsibility of Sweepstakes Officer, who
      must notify Scorekeepor as soon as possible after the drawing.

      * Ambassador salary: responsibility of Ambassador for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      payment is earned.

      * Stock dividends: responsibility of the Banker for notifying
      Scorekeepor no later than one Week following the time the
      dividends are earned.

      The Scorekeepor notification must be via the public forum or, if
      individually subscribable distribution lists are implemented,
      must be made on a distribution list which is potentially
      available to anyone who wishes to subscribe to it.  This
      paragraph takes precendence over other Rules which would require
      a private Scorekeepor notification. The notification need not be
      on a separate message, as long as the Scorekeepor is mentioned,
      and the message is on a list which is received by the
      Scorekeepor.

      Other classes of Point changes whose legal responsibilty for
      reporting is other than the Scorekeepor may be defined by other
      Rules.

========================================

Rule 907 (Mutable)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

907.

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action "as
      soon as possible", e is required to perform this action before
      performing any other actions which have a less strictly defined
      time requirement.  However, activity of a purely discussionary
      nature is excluded from the ordering requirement, and may be
      conducted at any time.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which stipulate a
      less stringent ordering requirement for the performance of these
      actions.
      (*Was: 805*)

========================================

Rule 908 (Mutable)
Formal Apologies

908.  Time Requirement for Formal Apologies

      If a Player (herein called the Squealer) makes a Call For
      Judgement alleging that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has
      acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in violation
      of one or more Rules, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the
      Judge must issue an Injunction that the Ninny submit a Formal
      Apology.  This Injunction may also include a list of up to ten
      Prescribed Words.  By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at
      least 200 words, containing all of the Prescribed Words,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement, and posted in the Public Forum within 72
      hours of the posting of the Injunction to the Public Forum.
      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall lose 10
      points.  Within 72 hours of the posting of this Formal Apology,
      the Squealer must either submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Apology be accepted, or submit a Proposal that the Ninny's
      Aplology be rejected, but not both.  No other Player may submit
      such a Proposal, and the Squealer may submit only one.  If a
      Proposal to accept the Apology fails, or if a Proposal to reject
      the Apology passes, then the Ninny loses 5 Points.

Rule 910
Appeals and the Justiciar

910.  The Justices and the Justiciar

      Let there be three Players known as the Justices, and an Office
      known as the Justiciar.  The Justiciar shall not receive a
      weekly salary.  The Speaker and the Clerk of the Courts are
      ineligible to be Justiciar.

      The positions of Justice shall be held by the Speaker, the Clerk
      of the Courts, and the Justiciar;  or by their representatives
      as detailed in this Rule.

      The Justices shall have the duty to Judge Statements that have
      been Appealed.  They shall receive the same compensation as
      Judges for each Statement so Judged.

      The Speaker and Clerk may delegate their duties as Justices to
      other willing Players if they desire.  They must do so if a
      Player would otherwise hold more than one position of Justice.

      Any Justice must so delegate eir duties for a particular case
      if e made the original CFJ, if e was the Judge of the original
      CFJ, or if e was Accused by that CFJ of breaking a Rule or
      committing a Crime.

      If no Player is willing to receive the duties of Justice for a
      case, the Clerk of the Courts shall select one randomly.

========================================

Rule 911 (Mutable)
Appealing Judgement

911.  Appealing Judgement

      A Judgement may be Appealed upon the insistence of any three
      Players to the Public Forum.

      If a Judgement is successfully Appealed, the Justices shall each
      Judge the Statement as if they were Judges.  They may confer
      with each other on the case before delivering Judgement if they
      desire.  If a Justice should fail to return Judgement in the
      allotted time, e shall be fined three Points for each day by
      which e missed the deadline.  This fine shall be levied by the
      Scorekeepor.

      If a majority of the Justices' Judgements agree, the Statement
      shall be considered to have been Judged accordingly.  Otherwise,
      it shall be considered to have been ruled UNDECIDED.  The
      Justices' reasoning and arguments shall be recorded with the
      original CFJ.

      Once a Judgement has been made, the Justices may make
      Injunctions just as may Judges, provided a majority of them
      agree.

      The decision of the Justices is final; no further Appeal of that
      Statement may be made.

      If the decision of the original Judge of the Statement is
      changed by the Justices, the Judge shall return the compensation
      e received to the Point Reserve.

      follows:

            Enact a Rule, but awards an existing Patent Title to a
            person.
         (Run for Office) shall be used if a Proposal seeks to place a
            Player in Office, according to the Rules for Offices.

      Judgement must satisfy one or more of the following conditions:

          - clearly allege that a specific Move is illegal;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule is illegal or lacking
            in legal force, in whole or in part;
          - clearly allege that a specific Rule ought to be
            interpreted in a certain way.
          - clearly allege that the current published game state is
            incorrect, and in what respects.

      A CFJ which does not satisfy at least one of the above
      conditions shall be deemed invalid and shall not be accepted for

========================================

Rule 663 (Mutable)
Injunctions--General

663.  General Rules For Injunctions

      There shall be an entity known as an Injunction, which may
      accompany certain Judgements of TRUE or FALSE as provided in the
      rules. An Injunction is a statement or series of statements
      specifying an action or actions which must take place. If a
      Judgement is is accompanied by an Injunction, that Injunction
      must be published with the Judgement. All players must abide by
      the Injunction beginning no later than 72 hours after its
      publication unless one of the following conditions then apply:
        - The Judgement which the Injunction accompanies is undergoing
          appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of the appeal
          process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but a proposal
          has been published which would overturn that decision if
          passed, and said proposal has not failed.
        - The validity of the Injunction itself is questioned by a
          pending CFJ.
        - A Judgement upholding the validity of the Injunction is
          undergoing appeal, currently UNDECIDED as a consequence of
          the appeal process, or, has been appealed and SUSTAINED, but
          a proposal has been published which would overturn that
          decision if passed, and said proposal has not failed.

      A Judgement may not be accompanied by an Injunction unless it is
      specifically permitted elsewhere in the rules. An Injunction
      must be completely consistent with all rules in effect at the
      time of issuance, and must be completely relevant to the matter
      addressed in the corresponding judgement.

      If any Player believes that an Injunction or any part of it does
      not meet the criteria for a valid Injunction, e may submit a CFJ
      to that effect. If the resulting Judgement supports the
      contention that the criteria are not met, the Injunction shall
      be considered illegal and shall have no legal force.

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing Injunctions.

========================================

Rule 664 (Mutable)
Illegal Injuctions are Crimes

      Judgement supports the allegation, the Judge may include with
      the Judgement an Injunction specifying that the move is to be
      retracted, and any resulting adjustments to the published game
      state. The adjustments to the game state must have been
      unambiguously specified within the CFJ, and these adjustments
      must only undo actions which were a direct or indirect result of
      that Move.

========================================

Rule 669 (Mutable)

      asked if e wants the Office, and if not, a new one shall be
      selected in the same manner.

      If any agreement among Players includes any transfer of Points
      between two Players then each such transfer shall be in
      accordance with the above.  But this Rule shall not be construed
      as having any bearing on the legality or legal enforceability of
      any terms of said agreement which do not involve such a
      transfer.

      All Nomic Entities shall abide by the above limits whenever
      Points are traded.  If a Nomic Entity must trade Points by the
      current Rules but would end up breaking the above limits, then
      the Nomic Entity trades the maximum amount possible without
      breaking any of the above limits.  This Rule shall have
      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the Trading of
      Points.

698.  Lack of Eligible Judges

      If there are no other Players Eligible to be chosen as Judge for

      precedence over all other Rules pertaining to the selection of

Rule 713 (Mutable)
Welfare

713.  Welfare Reform

      There shall be a quantity known as the Poverty Line, which shall
      be equal to 20% of the average score of all Active Players. If
      any active Player's score is less than the Poverty Line at the
      beginning of the Nomic Week, then each such active Player's
      score shall be increased to the Poverty Line by transferring
      points from the Point Reserve, provided there are sufficient
      points therein to cover all such transfers.

      Registrar a message (known as the Application) containing a list
      of the set X of Players, all of whom must be unaffiliated with
      any other Group; and a name for the proposed Group.  The
      Application may also contain an Initial Set of Ordinances
      for the Group.

      When the Registrar receives Applications from three Players in
      X, having identical information (as described above), all within
      a week of each other, than the Group shall be registered, with
      the given Name and Initial Set of Ordinances (if one was
      included), and the three Players who sent Applications as
      Members of that Group.  The Registrar shall then post in the
      Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along with its Name
      and Membership.

      A player may resign from a Group of which e is a Member, at any
      time, by sending such a message to the Registrar and the Vizier
      of that Group.  This rule takes precedence over all other rules
      concerning Groups.

========================================

Rule 719 (Mutable)
Joining a Group

719.  How to Join a Group

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a
      Group at any time after Registration of the Group only as
      specified in that Group's Ordinances, so long as they do not
      conflict with the rules.  However, other rules may establish
      other restrictions on Group Membership, and no Player shall
      become a Member of a Group without eir sending such a request to
      the Vizier of that Group.

      A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

      Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify:

      1.   how the Ordinances of that Group may be changed, or that
      they may not be changed.  If the Ordinances do not so specify,
      then the Ordinances shall be changed only upon unanimous
      agreement of all Members of that Group.

      2.  the Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member
      of that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify,
      the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that Group
      was received first by the Registrar, if e is still a Member of
      that Group.

      3.  the Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the
      Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances do
      not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be its
      Ordinancekeepor.

      4.  How the Points or Currencies in the Group's Treasury shall
      be spent, so long as it does not conflict with the Rules.  A
      Group may spend Points or Currencies in the same manner as a
      Player.  When Points or Currencies are to be spent from the
      Group's Treasury, the Vizier of that Group shall inform the
      Scorekeepor or Recordkeepor for the Currency, as is appropriate.

Call For Judgement 151

The Judge is Dave Bowen

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Thu, 09 Jun 94 10:03:29 SET

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Thu Jun  9 09:06:44 EDT 1994

The Judgement:  

Scorekeepor:    

====================

The Statement:

"Player Seth, while not being On Hold, failed to post a message to the
listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ during the 14
consecutive calendar days from April 30 up to including May 14.
Therefore (Rule 460) he is deemed to have left the Game and shall be
considered to be removed from the list of Players from May 15 onwards."

Argument: As may be checking from the server logs, Seth did not post
any message in the given period. Nor did he vote, as there were no
proposals up for vote during that period. Nor did he issue a CFJ or
submit a proposal. Hence, according to Rule 460 he should be
deregistered.

Reference:
460.  Deregistration of Inactive Players

      A Player not On Hold who fails to post a message to the
      listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ for 14
      consecutive calendar days is deemed to have left the Game and
      shall be removed from the list of Players. If the former Player
      re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the same score as when
      e left and e shall not be considered a new Player. Otherwise, e
      shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

The Appeal:

Scorekeepor:


**********************

The Statement:

    "The Banker must auction the Stocks as we entered at least
     one new Game since April 26."


**********************

The Judgement:

Ian judges this statement to be TRUE.

Arguments:

It seems clear that at least one game ended and at least one new one has
been started. Even if the Speakorship hasn't been transferred yet, our
scores have been set to zero, which is the way it is supposed to go. The
Bankor must auction the Stocks.

**********************
**********************

Appeal Arguments:

Dave Bowen:

   While Ian's reasoning was correct based on the information available at
the time, the Scorekeepor has corrected his report since then.  Anyone care
to join me in an Appeal.

Ian:

After I sent that in, I got Stella?'s updated score list and realized my error.

Stella?:

As for the Appeal.
As the Appeal on CFJ 143 was rejected, the statement of this CFJ can
only be TRUE if a game ended for other reasons than reasons related
to the submission (which might have implied Stella? to win a game)
and voting (which might have implied David B. to win a game) of the
Black Repeals.

As this was not the case IMO the Judge of CFJ 146 erred and therefore
I follow David B. in his Appeal.

NOTES:  Player Alice has informed me that she is supposed to be on

**********************

The Statement:

      "Dave Bowen won a Game on May 5 GMT"

**********************

The Judgement:

I accept judgeship, and decide FALSE.

Reason: CFJ 143 has ruled that Stella?'s Black Proposals were invalid, and
called for undoing of all their effects. Thus, Bowen (nor anyone else) received
no Points for voting on these, and therefore did not achieve the number of
Points for a Win.

It seems that neither Stella? nor Bowen has won the games I thought
they had, and thus I have retracted one Champion title from each.
Otherwise, I am expecting that I may be on Hol(i)d(ay) in the near future,
and thus I am interested in candidates to take over the posts of
Distributor, Assistant (preferably one Player for these two as I've
discovered the usefulness of combining them) and Registrar.
Also I would be interested in PROSIRUP members to take over
the Offices of Vizier and Ordinancekeepor.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

Call For Judgement 151

The Judge is Dave Bowen

Caller:         Stella?
Date:           Thu, 09 Jun 94 10:03:29 SET

Barred Players: NONE

Judge:          Dave Bowen
Date Assigned:  Thu Jun  9 09:06:44 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Thu, 09 Jun 1994 09:01:55 -0500

The Judgement:  TRUE

Scorekeepor:    Dave Bowen receives 5 points for Speedy Judgement.


====================

The Statement:

"Player Seth, while not being On Hold, failed to post a message to the
listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ during the 14
consecutive calendar days from April 30 up to including May 14.
Therefore (Rule 460) he is deemed to have left the Game and shall be
considered to be removed from the list of Players from May 15 onwards."

Argument: As may be checking from the server logs, Seth did not post
any message in the given period. Nor did he vote, as there were no
proposals up for vote during that period. Nor did he issue a CFJ or
submit a proposal. Hence, according to Rule 460 he should be
deregistered.

Reference:
460.  Deregistration of Inactive Players

      A Player not On Hold who fails to post a message to the
      listserv, cast a Vote, or submit a Proposal or CFJ for 14
      consecutive calendar days is deemed to have left the Game and
      shall be removed from the list of Players. If the former Player
      re-enters the same Game, it shall be with the same score as when
      e left and e shall not be considered a new Player. Otherwise, e
      shall enter on the same terms as a new Player.

====================

The Judgement: TRUE

Explanation:  As I noted in my ruling on CFJ 149, I could find no evidence
              Seth's posting, voting, proposing or calling for judgement
              in the interval in question.  Nor could the submitter of this
              proposal.  The Registrar does not list Seth as being on Hold.
              Therefore, he must be deemed to have left the game in accordance
              with Rule 460.

Player Chuck is most correct on this issue.  I have misread the Rules

CFJs.

Mighty Speaker, and fellow Agoramaniacs,

I am ON HOLD as of today.

I am certain I will think of and my computer you often while I backpack in 
the Grand Canyon.

NOT.  :)

I will be back after June 19th.

Coren

Hello David!  And since my friend David is playing, and since my mail is now
caught up, I hereby formally ask to be re-instated to the game, with apologies
