Swann's financial status is as follows:

1.2 VTs, 2 P-Notes, 3 Indulgences.
Bank owes em 6 Payment Orders of 0.2 VTs each.
No other debts or credits.
No Will.

Therefore I submit the following plan:

1) Vacate all Payment Orders naming the Bank as payor and Swann as payee.
2) Transfer 1.2 VTs from Swann to the Bank.
3) Transfer 2 P-Notes from Swann to the Bank.
4) Transfer 3 Indulgences from Swann to the Bank.
5) Announce that Swann's Probate is completed.
