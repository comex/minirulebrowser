Rule 1533 is infected and amended.  It now reads:


Rule 1533/8 (Power=1)
Application to Create an Organization

      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create
      an Organization (ACO).  A valid ACO, in order to have effect
      upon Execution, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      An valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      being sent to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be Executed.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Hi,

The operating system on yoyo was updated over the weekend.  During the
installation, a new copy of sendmail (from the CD) was installed on the
machine.  That wasn't set up properly and as a result some mail
(especially majordomo ones since there was no majordomo.cf file too!)
bounced.

It should all be working now.  Please let me know if you receive any
more bounced messages.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

  Leon Troeth

I haven't seen any sign of an appeal on Vlad's
recent dismissal of CFJ 935.  I also haven't seen
any response to my question about how dismissed
CFJs are to be treated wrt game custom.

So I will assume, for the purposes of my upcoming
reports, the following:

1)  CFJ 935 is complete and all POs that I had
previously listed as in dispute are now valid.

2)  Vlad's reasoning wrt to CFJ 935 is now a part
of game custom.

This would mean that Indulgences and P-Notes were
not destroyed at all by the passage of the PC
proposal.  My reports will now reflect this fact. 
If anybody still disagrees, please feel free to
submit additional CFJs (or to appeal CFJ 935, if
there is still time).

-- Crito

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

I am of the opinion (and I do not think I am alone in this) that a Judge's
reasoning does not necessarily enter into Game Custom (and in fact the Rules
attach no particular importance to a Judge's reasoning).

I Claim the above to be in error, in that the legality of all Payment Orders
in Indulgences resulting from the commission of Infractions is currently in
dispute, as as such as of the date reported, and more appropriately, as of the
date of this supposed Payment Order, there is no valid cause for the above
report of an Infraction; further, in that the legality of reporting Infractions 
simultaneously with executing Payment Orders corresponding to penalties 
incurred thereunder is itself dubious.

Well, this seems to bring Blots into question, but I didn't read it as bringing
POs into question.  But maybe I am misunderstanding the implications of 937. 
Please enlighten me if this is the case.  8)

I thought this might be the case, but no one responded to my question about it
before this.  Also, there is nothing else in the verdict of CFJ 935 that I can
use to apply to my reports in determining their accurate status, so I choose to
focus on the "not necessarily" in your statement - meaning nothing prevents me
from using the Judge's reasoning.  Feel free to make other CFJs better worded
than mine was in resolving this issue.

Morendil,

My apologies, but I cannot find my copy of CFJ 937 (I probably deleted it by
mistake).  Could you please forward me a copy of that.  I would like to
consider it carefully before responding to your Claim of Error.

Thanks,

<snip>

First, I would like to thank Morendil for eir prompt response in providing me
with a copy of the relevant CFJ after I had so carelessly deleted it from my
files.  Thank you, Morendil.

The text of the CFJ states, to paraphrase, no one is currently required to
report a change in Blots.  The question for me is, does this CFJ cause
Indulgence POs to be put in dispute?  Without a careful look at the rules, and
application of some judicial reasoning, my answer would be "no".  The fact that
no one has to report a change in Blots, in and of itself, says nothing about
whether the Blot is valid (undisputed).

So I am forced to apply judicial reasoning even to determine whether any POs
are in dispute.  There seems to be precedent which would allow me to dismiss
this claim out of hand for just this reason.  However, my only example of this
is Scott, and I don't know how much one Player's opinion counts toward game
custom.  Therefore I will take this one step further.

If a True verdict would definitely invalidate the Indulgence POs (or a False
verdict for that matter), then I would be inclined to say, yes, the POs are in
dispute.  However, I note there are at least two rules in question here, R1504
and R1435.  Only if these rules are judged to be in conflict could there be a
possibility that POs would be invalid, as I see it.  There is a possible
judicial interpretation which would make the CFJ statement True, but leave
Indulgence POs intact as they stand.  Since the CFJ statement makes no mention
of a conflict between these or any other Rules, it is at best ambiguous whether
any POs are in dispute.  Since it is the province of the Courts, not
Recordkeepors, to resolve ambiguities, I hereby deny this claim.

As to the question of issuing the PO at the same time as the reporting of the
infraction, there are plenty of examples, even in the Rules, of messages
containing sequential actions considered to be separated by infinitesimal
amounts of time.  Reporting an Infraction and issuing a PO in the same message
is just such a sequence.  Forcing the Infraction reporter to send separate
messages for reporting and issuing a PO is a needless encumbrance.
