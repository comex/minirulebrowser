Don't we have some similar Judgement?

I think it's still unsettled whether "madee available" in R.1513 means
made available as a matter of law, or made available as a matter of
fact.  I tend to favor the latter, and interpret R.1513's requirement
so that a document has been "made available" to a person if it has
been sent to that person, or posted in a public place (i.e. the Public
Forum).  I believe some people favor the former, and interpret
R.1513's requirement so that a document has been "made available" if
the Rules establish a requirement for the publication or transmission
of that document either upon request or periodically.

I am even more concerned about the first requirement of the second
paragraph, however.  "No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player
to perform or not perform an action unless the information of which
actions can be required of em by that Entity have been previously
provided to that Player."  What, exactly, does this mean?  It might
very well be vacuous.  Rule 1513 specifies that such non-Rule entities
have whatever Power is given them by the Rules.  The required
information must therefore appear somewhere in the Rules, and the
Rules are provided to every Player.

It's kind of tempting to argue that a document that is available
on request, and which is required to be so, is available as a matter
of fact, and not merely as a matter of law. Is that reasonable, or
am I conceptually confused?

This is nomic, remember?  All of those requirements to be

Ok, so they could be eliminated. If that were to happen we would
definitly need regulations as in 1513 for The Rules, too. But as it
is, we don't need them, and we don't have them. 1513 is about
non-rules entities.

>Can we repeal R1494, please?

I never actually got a Welcome Message as described in R1494, and as a result I
did not have any idea that I was required to be subscribed to the yoyo backup
list, or how to subscribe.  I ended up missing a lot of mail when teleport went
down.  Fortunately, Vanyel does a great job maintaining the archives.  8)

I think R1494 is a good idea - a list of all lists and how to subscribe them is
a nice courtesy for new players, especially ones that are not so e-mail savvy.

Well, the first runs into problems in the event that
other rules cause the patrts of a message to have their effect at
a later time than when they are sent.  The second, I think,
is just a different form of legal fiction.  (As other rules
may implicitly establish certain other times when they acquire
legal significance.

Does it matter if the Player knows it is available upon request?
Consider the following situation: I induce a friend to send messages
to the game the result in his registration and performance of game
actions. However, he has never heard of Nomic or Agora, and has no
conception of the import of his actions, but only does it at my bidding.
Have the Rules been "made available" to him? I would suggest not.

Well, a consistent set of timing Rules, or use of precedence
for such a rule as the one above, ought to prevent any need for 
legal fiction in this case.
