I don't think this is quite sufficient, because it doesn't deal with
another grey area in the Holiday Rules, namely what we might call
"pseudo-requirements" such as voting. Players are not required to vote,
so there is a sense in which voting is not an action which a Player is
required to perform before a given time. On the other hand, a Player who
wishes to vote is required to do so before the end of the Voting Period,
and so in another sense is required to act before a given a time - if e
wishes to cast a vote. One could sensibly interpret the word
"requirement" in either way.

I'm pretty sure that this issue has been before the Courts before, but
once again my memory fails me and I have no idea which CFJ it was, nor
what decision was made. Can anyone help me out here?

I've no doubt at all that you can produce a copy of the message. That is
not in dispute. But I still think that doesn't show that the message was
sent to you, or that you received it.

We can dismiss Kelly's argument that sending oneself a message is a
"nullity" (as she puts it). To take a familiar example, sending oneself
a message through the ordinary post has legal consequences which writing
the exact same message down and simply putting it in your desk drawer
does not have. The same is true of email, at least as far as Agoran law
is concerned (RL law I don't know about.) The attachment of headers by
whatever systems the message passes through on its way back to you have
legal and evidential significance.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal #3956 by harvel, AI=1
Issues

Amend R.1764 by inserting at the beginning of its text the 
ONE-delimited text; by replacing section (a) with the TWO-delimited
text; by replacing section (c) with the THREE-delimited text; and
by replacing each occurrence in section (d) of 'Proposal, Election or 
Referendum' with 'Issue'.


ONE
	There are three classes of Issues: Proposals, Elections, and
	Referenda.
ONE

TWO
	(a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
	    Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the 
	    prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.
TWO

THREE
	(c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of voting for
	    that particular Issue is permanently set to the prevailing mode
	    for that class of Issue.
THREE


Amend R.1715 by replacing its entire text with the FOUR-delimited text.

FOUR
	A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on an Issue by sending a
	message to that effect to the Issue's Vote Collector.  Solely for
	the purpose of determining Quorum, this Player is considered to have
	voted on that Issue.  If e also casts a Vote on that Issue, e is 
	counted only once toward Quorum.
FOUR


Amend R.1717 by replacing the FIVE-delimited text with the SIX-delimited
text.


FIVE
      At any time during the Voting Period of a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by stating
      so in the Public Forum. If that does not happen, it is not a
      Senate Vote.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Votes. If an
      Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum by the time it becomes a Senate Vote,
      eir votes are cancelled.
FIVE

SIX
	At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue, the Speaker
	may make it a Senate Vote, by stating so in a Public Forum.  An
	Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

	Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
	Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
	cancelled.
SIX


Amend R.879 by inserting at the end of R.879's text the SEVEN-delimited
text.

SEVEN
	Other Rules may provide an explicit method whereby a Player who has
	not voted on a Proposal may be considered, for the purposes of Quorum,
	to have voted on that Proposal.
SEVEN

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #3957 by Wes, AI=1
Discarding the Chaff

Repeal Rule 1643.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #3958 by Murphy, AI=1
Fix Rule 1886

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal #3959 by Steve, AI=1
Fix Debt Voting

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1824 (Debt Voting) be amended to read:

      If, at the beginning of the week, there is at least one Overdue
      Payment Order billing the Payor for Voting upon Proposals, then
      the Payor commits the Infraction of Debt Voting. This Infraction
      shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens, and shall
      bear the penalty of the denial of Voting Privileges for a period
      of two weeks.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1823 (Combining Payment Orders) be
amended by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for Voting
      upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with Payment
      Orders executed for any other purpose.

with text which reads:

      Payment Orders executed for the purpose of billing the Payor for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

My reasoning was that Wes *should have* published in such a way that e
violated neither R1023 nor R1769. E could, but e did not.

Someone else can, if they want to.  As Rulekeepor, I have treated the
Assessor's Report of Dec. 28 as a valid and correct one, and have recorded
Dec. 28 1999 as the date of the Rule Changes effected by the Proposals
assessed in that report.

Subject: RE: Dead Contests


I resign as Contestmaster of "A Tournament of Prediction", which should
dissolve it.  I don't think it needs to undergo Probate.

The past several months have shown an alarming dearth of controversial
Proposals, which made this Contest pretty useless anyway.

Here are potential Regulations for a much more general Contest.  Would
anyone be interested?

      1.  The name of this Contest is "Casino Morongo".

      2.  The first Contestmaster is Murphy.

      3.  The Contestmaster may transfer that position to another
          consenting Player by announcing it in the Public Forum.

      4.  There is no entry fee.

      5.  Chips are a Currency.  The MUQ of Chips is 1.  The
          Recordkeepor of Chips is the Contestmaster.

          The Contestmaster shall act as necessary to make the
          Rules of Agora recognize Chips as a Currency.

      6.  Once per month, the Contestmaster may announce a set of
          exchange rates between Chips and one or more other
          Currencies.  The Contest shall buy or sell Chips upon
          Contestant request, according to the latest exchange
          rates.  A Currency with no exchange rate may not be used
          to buy or sell Chips in this way.

      7.  The Contestmaster may announce a Betting Topic in the
          Public Forum.  A Betting Topic has these components:

            a) Time Limit:  A future point in time.
            b) Event:  An event that may occur by the Time Limit.
            c) Odds:  A payoff ratio (e.g. 2.5 to 1).

      8.  Between a Betting Topic's Announcement Time and Time Limit,
          a Contestant may bet a number of eir Chips on that Topic, by
          transferring them to the Contest for that sole purpose.

      9.  When a Betting Topic's Event occurs between its Announcement
          Time and Time Limit, for each Contestant who bet on that
          Topic, the Contest shall pay that Contestant an amount of
          Chips equal to eir bet times the Odds.  For instance, with
          Odds of 2.5 to 1, a Contestant betting 12 Chips would be
          paid 30 Chips.

     10.  Upon the dissolution of this Contest, all its Currency shall
          be transferred to the Contestmaster, who shall continue to
          buy or sell Chips according to the latest exchange rates (as
          if e were acting on behalf of the Contest) as long as any
          entity other than emself possesses Chips.

          The Contestmaster shall act as necessary to give the Contest
          a Will to this effect.

     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 46, ISSUE 6
     Millennium edition
     January 2, 1900


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Discarding the Chaff" by Wes - Proposal 3957 adopted 12/27
  Repeal Rule 1643 (Statements of Policy).

"Fix Debt Voting" by Steve - Proposal 3959 adopted 12/27
  Reword Rules 1823 and 1824 to state that Voting POs are to bill for
    Votes, not pay for Votes.

"Fix Rule 1886" by Murphy - Proposal 3958 adopted 12/27
  Replace "pay" with "pay out to" in Rule 1886 (Returning to Life).

"Issues" by harvel - Proposal 3956 adopted 12/27
  An Issue is a Proposal, Election, or Referendum.  This new term is
    used to simplify some Rules.
  Rule 879 (Quorum) explicitly allows other Rules to define ways for
    Players to count towards Proposal Quorum without Voting.

[There is an outstanding claim that the Voting Periods of these
 Proposals is extended till 1/1 due to the Christmas Holiday.  This
 will probably not prevent their eventual adoption, though.]

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Clean Up Probate.  Again." by Murphy
  Conditions for entering Probate are bulleted.
  Payment Orders don't trigger Probate unless outstanding.
  Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans), long obsolete, is repealed.

"Oligarchs" by Michael
  There are six Oligarchs:  one at level 3, two at level 2, and three
    at level 1.
  Each Oligarch has Proposal Votes equal to eir level.  No one else may
    Vote on Proposals.
  Each month:
    The level 3 Oligarch is removed.
    A level 2 Oligarch is promoted by level 1 vote.
    A level 1 Oligarch is promoted by the new level 3 Oligarch.
    An Auction or Election fills the now-vacant level 1 Oligarch spot.
  The Speaker may declare a Proposal Open (everyone may vote on it),
    but may never be an Oligarch.

"CFJ Streamlining" by Wes
  A CFJ's Deliberation Period explicitly begins with the CotC's
    announcement of a Judge.
  A Player fined for Judging Late becomes ineligible to Judge further
    CFJs, till e requests otherwise in the PF.
  A Player is fined for Judging a Bit Late even if e Judges or dismisses
    the CFJ before the CotC can apply the fine.
  A Judge ceases to be assigned to a CFJ if e becomes ineligible for
    any reason.
  Failing to grant or deny a Motion within a week is grounds for the CotC
    to Recuse and assign a new Judge.
  A Motion for a closed case whose Judge is no longer an Active Player
    is assigned to a new Judge.

"Wins, Wins, Wins" by Wes
  Points are a Currency, transferred only when the Rules explicitly allow
    or require that Points be Awarded or Penalized.
  Points are transferred only if someone points out the relevant event
    and Rule within 7 days.
  Having at least 200 Points is a Win Condition, upon which all Points
    are destroyed and all Point POs are vacated.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1190 "The Private Payment Order executed in this message is
          executed for the purpose of paying for votes, within the
          meaning given to that phrase by the Judgement (sustained on
          Appeal) in CFJ 1183."
         12/25  Called by Steve
         12/26  Assigned to Michael
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve intends to continue
           executing such Private Payment Orders until Wes pays for eir
           vote on Proposal 3857.  This can be interpreted (in at least
           a couple of ways) as having the indirect purpose of making
           Wes pay for that Vote, and CFJ 1183 sets precedent that Rule
           1824 recognizes indirect purposes.

CFJ 1192 "Clerk of the Courts Wes violated Rule 1769 when he
[TRUE]    distributed the Official Judgement of CFJ 1183 on December
          26, 1999, during the Christmas Holiday designated by Rule
          1870."
         12/26     Called by Kelly
         12/27-30  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's commentary (summary):  ASAP means "within 7 days", and
           a Holiday is never longer than 7 days, so it is always
           possible to do something according to the usual definition
           of ASAP without doing it during a Holiday.
         Reporter's commentary:  That doesn't mean it's easy.  If
           something occurs one hour before a 7-day Holiday, and you
           must react to it ASAP but not during a Holiday, then you can
           only react to it during that one-hour time period between
           the event and the start of the Holiday.  I wonder what
           Lindrum would have to say about this.

Right.  The vote is exactly the same, either way.

ASAP means within one week, not within less than that time.  There are
very good reasons for that and a holiday should be no reason to give
players less time in which to carry out their duties.

The backup lists are agora (tue) and nomic (yoyo) on egroups.

Rule 1023 contains this sentence:

to be doing by, if not preventing, then penalizing actions during the
Holiday.

"should be" != "is".  I agree that it's grossly unfair to Wes, but I, for one,
find Palnatoke's logic to be sound.

Unfortunately, this message was originally captured by the
agora@win.tue.nl spam filter as being from someone who is not on the
list. I will soon be introducing some measures to overcome this problem
(I can make a list of non-subscribed addresses that are allowed to post).
I would advise Wes to re-sent it by that time, as I am not sure whether
this counts as a posting to the PF by Wes.

    Clerk of the Courts Wes violated Rule 1769 when he distributed 
    the Official Judgement of CFJ 1183 on December 26, 1999, during 
    the Christmas Holiday designated by Rule 1870.

======================================================================

Motion 1192.1 by Kelly:

    I also move the Judge of the CFJ to require Wes to submit a 
    Formal Apology for this Offense, per Rule 908.

Granted by Palnatoke

    I further grant motion 1192.1. Wes must submit a Formal Apology.
    The Apology must contain these Prescribed Words:

    art, Bethlehem, comfortable, dilemma, erudite, flag, gremlin, 
    Herodotus, I, journal

======================================================================

Called by:           Kelly

======================================================================

Evidence attached by the Caller:

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

Wes had to distribute the Judgement 'ASAP', which is the same as 
within 7 days. Since a Holiday *cannot* have a duration of more than 
7 days, Wes *could have* made the distribution within the bounds of 
both Rule 1769 and Rule 1023.

Another message that originally came from Wes, but was not accepted
because he is subscribed as magika@ipns.com instead of magika@aracnet.com.


We hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1192. The seven day period to which
Palnatoke refers in eir Judgement ended before the end of the Holiday,
due to the fact that it began shortly before the Holiday. 

We also call for the Appeal of the Judicial Order 1192.1 for the same
reasons on the grounds that it is highly innappropriate to impose a
penalty upon one who has not broken a valid Rule.

Actually, he tried to, but failed because he was not subscribed at that

Apparently you were not unsubscribed from the backup list agora@win.tue.nl.
That one is not normally used, but is now because the main lists seem to
not be working any more. I have now unsubscribed you.

The following addresses are subscribed to agora@win.tue.nl, but are not
able to receive email at the time. I will not at this time unsubscribe
them (except for magika@ipns.com which has clearly been superseded by
magika@aracnet.com) because they might be addresses down for the Christmas
holidays or because of a millennium bug. However, I would like to be
informed if any of you recognizes one of these addresses as now being
defunct (e.g. your own prior address).

By R1924:

I pay out 1 Indulgence to elJefe and Lee. The Bank pays these.
I order Crito to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank.

By my reading of R1924 (specifically "Only for those three months past,
/ Have been held b'eir master last", which I interpret as "Only those
Zombies owned by their current master for all of the past quarter"),
since Oerjan came to life before the end of the quarter, I don't get
billed. Thoughts?

It's a good thing no one has done an all-poetry nomic ;)

 Deposits will be credited to an account by the timestamp of the message
 containing the Transfer Order; withdrawls will be debited by the
timestamp
 of the message containing the withdrawl notice.

 Other Services:

    * Transfer N units of an ABC and N Denaria to the Bank, and the Bank
      will transfer N units of another ABC back.

    * Transfer 1.05*N units of an ABC, and the Bank will transfer N

      your account as a withdrawl or loan. You may specify restrictions
      (e.g. "Use only currency deposited to pay them; do not issue
loans").

Another message that originally did not get through because of being
from a non-subscriber. For the time being I will solve this by subscribing
these people by hand. Again note that it is not clear whether or not
this has been sent to the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I see that my last two messages did not get through.

So, pursuant to the vacated Voting POs, I hereby issue the following:

The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Elysion 4 +VTs.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Elysion 4 +VTs.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay harvel 1 +VT.
The +VT Bank is ordered to pay Wes 1 +VT.

The +VT Bank pays these.

I just got nailed with a bunch of Agora mail, so I thought I'd write in and
say hi.  I psuedo-intentionally leave myself subscribe to the backup lists
for just this effect.  I hope everyone out there has had a good year or two
(can't remember how long it's been since I actually involved myself with
Agora).  I'm currently a Systems Admin for an ISP in NW Montana, USA (being
a Montanan by birth) and am enjoying myself.

I don't have enough time to handle Agora though, so I think I'll have to get
by with a few random messages every now and then.

ciao

lee@schawk.com is indeed receiving email from this list, agoralee should
be to, but may be dropped if you like.

There was a minor glitch this morning but otherwise both accounts receive
mail fine.

The cleveland freenet (supported by CWRU) closed it's doors some time this
year; it was not Y2K compliant, and it was not deemed worth the cost to
bring it up to par.  I am not 100% certain if this means that freenet access
is eliminated, or if email might continue to forward correctly, but if mail
is bouncing I'd wager that you can remove the address.

Yow ! What the heck is wrong with the lists at gecko ? I assume the 
matter has been discussed before (and, probably, at length) but 
unfortunately RL constraints have been keeping me from doing much 
more than skimming the occasional Agora-related mail. Thanks in 
advance to anyone who'll take the trouble to keep me posted...

AFAIK I'm still subscribed to all primary, secondary, backup and last-
resort lists under one email address or another, btw.

That's an argument about how the law should be, not about how it is. It
is entirely possible, even though undesirable, that the law should be
unjust.

The question of the relationship between Rules 1023 and 1769 is
actually surprisingly subtle, because the precedence claims they make
with respect to each other are quite complicated and specific. R1769
claims precedence over all Rules which specify deadlines by which
actions must be performed, while R1023 *defers* to Rules which impose
*earlier* latest times than it does, and *takes precedence* over Rules
which define *later* latest times than it does.

When two Rules are in conflict, the effects of the lower precedence
Rule are annulled *to the extent of the conflict*. Now, R1023 takes
precedence over R1769 insofar as that Rule attempts to define a *later*
latest time. This means that the provisions in R1769 which attempt to
extend the time available to the CotC to publish Judgements to 24 hours
after the end of the Holiday are ineffective.

But insofar as R1769 effectively imposes an earlier latest time on the
CotC, ie the beginning of the Holiday, by prohibiting em from
publishing during the Holiday, R1023 defers to R1769 ("Other Rules may
impose earlier latest times.") Of course, R1769 does not explicitly say
that that is what it is trying to do, but nevertheless it is a logical
interpretation of the combined action of the two Rules.

The regrettable effect for Wes is that the period during which he could
legally publish the decision in CFJ 1183 was much shorter than seven
days. Undoubtedly that is unfair, but it's also the best sense I can
make of the Rules in question.
