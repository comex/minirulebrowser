Double bah.

PROTO-PROPOSAL

Rule 1513 shall be amended, by appending the following text:

      For the purpose of this Rule, a body of text shall be considered
      to have been made available to a Player if:

      a) the body of text in question has been posted to the Public
         Forum, but only if the Player in question was registered at
         the time the body of text in question was posted; 

      b) the body of text in question has been directly transmitted to
         that Player by any means and for any reason such that that
         Player can reasonably be expected to have received it; or

      c) the body of text in question is the Ruleset.

I'm very much against your redefining of 'made aware of'. The Rule does not
look at a presence of an obligion of making aware, but only of an actual making
aware ('making available' in the literal text). So any action that makes it
known to Players counts, not just one that happens to be prescribed by the rules.

Scott,

It struck me that you may have already issued
Transfer Orders to satisfy the Payment Orders from
the weekly Indulgence Lottery but they were lost
in the yoyo debacle.  If that's the case, could
you please send me a copy.  It doesn't look like
the lost messages are going to show up.  I still
haven't received the last message I sent to yoyo
just before it crashed.

Regards,
Crito

I actually did not issue them, because of the yoyo problem.  It
appears that everything has stabilized, and I plan on bringing
everything back up to speed this evening.

I think we need some way to deal with problems like this.  As it is,
our timing rules are far too inflexible.

BTW, is everyone subscribed to agora@win.tue.nl now?

I'm not attempting to redefine the phrase, Suber forbid - I think it has not
yet come to have a precise definition yet. I want to observe, though, that
'make available' does not imply 'is received', and that for the purpose of
obtaining a reasonably strong interpretation of that phrase it will very
probably come to mean something close to 'an obligation to publish' rather than
'an actual act of publication'.

For instance, I posit that were a Player to register now, and become a member
of the Misanthropists, e would immediately be subject to all obligations
arising from that SLC, even if there were some delay in actually sending the
text of the SLC to em.

I disagree.  I think "made aware" must necessary involve an actual act
of publication.  Whether or not that publication is one required by
the Rules, or one which is purely optional may or may not be an issue,
but I cannot consider a Player to have been "made aware" of the text
of a document without that document having been published or otherwise
communicated to em.

I disagree.  But I wouldn't admit a Player into a Group without first
transmitting a copy of the Group's Ordinances to that Player. :)

Um, it's not "aware", it's "available".

Hm, yes.  (What I get for posting tired.)

Still, I think for something to have been "made available", it has to
have been published.

Ha! That's no excuse: It's not even past midnight at your place! :-)

Greetings,

always fail - nowadays the problem is getting up while it still is
morning.)

PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Internomic Encouragement Act

Let the following rule be created:
(Title: Awards for InterNomic Proposals)

     A Player who submits an InterNomic Proposal shall receive the 
     following awards based upon the results of that InterNomic 
     Proposal.  The Ambassador shall pay out these awards as soon as 
     possible after e announces the results of the InterNomic Proposal.

       i) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, and Agora did 
          not vote FOR it, there is no award.
      ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora did 
          vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
     iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award 
          shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

     In addition, if the adoption of the InterNomic Proposal directly 
     results in Agora receiving enough InterNomic points to win a game 
     of InterNomic, the Player who submitted that InterNomic Proposal 
     shall Win the Game (of Agora).

{Comment: I thought it might be a good idea to recognize the players who
          make a contribution to Internomic, esp. if Agora wins Internomic.}
