No, and there's no record of any messages being trapped by
majordomo@gecko, either.

Here's another rejected mail. The problem is that Steve is subscribed
as gardner@aurora.cc.monash.edu.au, but has sent these mails as
gardner@silas-1.cc.monash.edu.au. Steve, provided that it is a valid
email address, subscribing as gardner@cc.monash.edu.au instead would
work.

This is an interesting case. Ordinarily we would accept reproduction of
the original message, as above, as sufficient to show that the message
was effective at the itme it was originally sent. If we do that in this
case, however, then more than a week has already passed since the
Election began, without there having been a Nomination, so the Election
would have had no result.

Nor can the above message be counted as initiating the Election anew,
since Speaker Murphy made it conditional on his not having done so
before, which, if the above argument is correct, he would have done.
