Minor Crisis

Below is a message I sent to agora-business on Friday, but I have not seen it
yet.  I'm going to try this backup list and see if things come through it.  The
Kudo transfer below is presented as backup to the original transfer - it is not
meant as an additional transfer.

In preparing the R-O-M selection this week, I finally noticed this was
published by Assessor Steve on May 08, 1998:

>Create a Rule with this text:

>      Upon the creation of this Rule:
>        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
>        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
>            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
>        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
>            that Player's possession.

>      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

Interestingly, nobody else seems to have noticed this either, when looking at
the latest Accountor and P-Note reports, since nobody made a COE on them. 
Needless to say, there were severe consequences as a result of this Rule being
created.  I am about to publish a corrected Accountor and P-Note report, plus
an amended Proposal Queue (only one priority change was affected).  This
constitutes a COE on the latest of those three reports.

Please note the failed Transfer Orders that may affect you.  Unfortunately
Chancellor Michael is going to have to mint some VTs and re-issue quite a few
TOs because of my inattention.  For this I apologize profusely and hereby
transfer a Kudo FROM myself for failing to take proper cognizance of the
effects of proposal passages TO Michael as compensation for the extra work I've
caused em.  Steve, you should also note that your promised rewards for the
P-Notes paid by other Players for your "Levers" proposal were wiped out.
