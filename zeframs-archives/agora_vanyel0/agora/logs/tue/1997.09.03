I would think there could be some clause regarding ignorance of the rules
here... R1513 was proposed (I believe) to prevent people from being bound
by rules which other players had the right to keep from them.  I would
suggest that it would be a good idea to amend the registration rule to say
that you may only register when you have recieved a copy of the current
ruleset, and that the act of registering implies that you have recieved the
current ruleset (thereby being bound by it).

Of course, it could be argued that if she registered, she obviously had
access to the ruleset, or else she wouldn't know how to register.  (i.e.
send a message to the public forum requesting it).

I have a question regarding how specifically the rules are worded.  Being
new here, I'm uncertain how picky people are, so I'm asking :)

If I have a rule which says:
-----
A player may be blown to smithereens.  A player is considered blown up when
he sends a message to the public forum declaring such.
-----

Does that mean that no player may be blown to smithereens?

I'll say first that the Rule contains the phrase "is considered",
which is a discouraged phrase of uncertain meaning.

In my opinion, 1 and 2 are illegal, 3 and 4 are legal.  In 2 the rule
was made available to you; you just chose not to read it.  I think
it's proper to consider a text as made available to a person if a copy
of it "enters your technical domain of control", the standard Oerjan
set for receipt of messages; or, if a copy is posted to the Public
Forum, since there seems to be a legal presumption that any post sent
to the PF is thereby being sent to each player.  Game Custom (case
law) is quite clear that actually reading a message is not necessary
to satisfy a requirement for receipt.

For no good reason, I might add.

I consider the wording of the second sentence quite clear.  It states
that when a Player states that e has been blown to smithereens, for
the purpose of the Rules, e shall be apprehended as having been thus
affected, even though in reality e has not.  A "legal fiction", if you
will.

I am not certain what the first sentence does, if anything.

I would be against.

On the point of historical detail, I proposed 1513 (or what later became 1513,
IIRC this provision was initially inserted in an amendment to the now-defunct
1538) in reaction to the infamous Mousetrap Scam, where a faction of Players 
scamming the newly-crafted Organization Rules attempted to forcibly enroll 
every Player into the Compact of a new Organization, without apparently being 
bound, or initially willing, to publish that Compact.

It seemed aberrant to me that a Player should be bound to abide by a text that
could be kept from em, thus the 'made available' wording. There was in my
opinion no need that a Player actually have read the relevant text, because our
Welcome Wagon, the Agora FAQ, etc. supposedly make it clear that when you
register you're required to obey the Rules, and thus if a Player is worried
about any SLC or other binding text e is supposed to first request those from
the appropriate Officers. If e plays without doing so, e is still bound by all
our rules and other subordinate instruments.

It is _sufficient_ for a text to be binding on a Player that there exist a
requirement that that text should be delivered to that Player, on demand or
without eir demand. I tentatively argued that it was required, but this is, I 
think, a matter for the Courts - and not, at that, a particularly urgent one.

BTW, are you the same Erick Robertson that was very briefly a Player during
the above-mentioned Mousetrap episode, specifically, IIRC, from Oct. 31 to Nov.
1 of 1995 ?

I think this one isn't very hard: Rule 101 takes precedence over Rule 1513,
so Rule 1513 does not deprive the Ruleset of its functionality.

>>
At the risk of brining this up again, let me throw out a few scenarios and
let me know what happens...
<<

I think that as far as proper rules are concerned, it _should_ work
like this (I'm not claiming it does right now):

Rules are binding for every player (101), so it is illegal to do
things that are against the rules. The rules are published often
enough, and if someone has technical difficulties receiving the rule
sets, e will also have the same difficulties playing in the first
place. 

If someone just starts playing without ever reading the rules (as in
Steve's example), well, tough luck if something goes wrong. Especially
for someone who knows the general concept of nomics (including rules
like 101!) it should be the obvious strategy not to make game moves
that might be illegal withoug checking the rules first - or run the
risk of making mistakes and face the consequences. And in fact, that
is what people usually do, anyway (hi, Vir!).

All the complications about making documents binding only if they are
available are introduced in 1513 only concerning _non-rule_ entities
that may require players to do things. Of course that's a different
matter, because they are not systematically archived and distributed
as the rules are, so special clauses like those in 1513 are needed.

So my answer to Vir's question is: if A, B, C and D are actually
_rules_ and not the kind of non-rule entities of 1513, all actions 1-4
are illegal. Or at least that's how it should be.

Umm.  Maybe I contributed more to your confusion rather than alleviating it.8(
POI014 and POI041 have both already been satisfied by your other (previously)
delayed Transfer Orders.  It's POI051 that you have to worry about now.  Even
though I know what you wanted to do, I think I will have to wait for you to
send a message specific to that PO before I can consider you to have submitted
another delayed TO.  Sorry.

You know, I wanted to do that, but it struck me that the Payment Orders
executed at the beginning of the report are not actually Payment Orders until
the report has been sent.  In order for me to accurately report them in the
Payment Orders section, they have to have already been sent to the PF, and I
have to have received the copy back in order to put the correct time stamp on
it in the list.  I'd rather not have to send separate messages and have to wait
for the first one to arrive before being able to send the second.

Hmm, I suppose I could list the "pending" POs with a disclaimer.

What some officers have done in the past in similar situations
is to simply list the time as "as of this message"--you might
consider doing that.

Thanks Lee for bringing some debate spirit into this!
(And for correcting the spelling on the subject line!)

I have been wondering about this "let's have some rules" issue for a while
now.
Suppose (hypothtically!) that there was no issue of mess, pizza parties,
noise, sleeping students on the couches.

Suppose all we have is wonderfully behaved group of 10 undergrads sitting there
having a quiet conversation about their cs15/16/169 u-name-it project,
TA-ing experience or party.

Would grad students still walk in and join the chat or would they walk away?
I have the feeling most of us would go to another place (e.g office or
some restaurant) to have lunch in solitude or with our reliable office mates...

If I am totally off base and grad students would join in as long as there are no
smells and no sleeping on the couches, I'm wondering what are possible
effective methods of enforcing such order and cleanliness.
If there is such a method I'd surely like to see it applied to TGIF,
departmental kitchens and the labs...

Hagit.

Yes, that's I good idea.  I'll probably use some sort of abbreviation for "as

But, it is further objected, the text of the Rule is available by asking
Chuck to e-mail her a copy - in fact, she could have done so before
joining.  Is that enough to satisfy R1513?  What if Jill had no idea
that the text of the Rule was available in this way - say, the only Nomic
she's played before was Blind Nomic?

That argument would fail.  The following conversation has occurred more
than once in the past:

<Watcher discovers the location of the mailing lists>
  Watcher:  How do I register to play?
Registrar:  By sending a message to this list saying that you want to.
  Watcher:  Oh, okay.  I want to register to play.
Registrar:  Okay, you're registered.

It seems that "as of this message" is accepted as an unambiguous timestamp.

I mentioned this to Hagit, but forgot to cc...

As a recent undergrad, I know that there are considerate and
inconsiderate undergrads.  It's pretty difficult to limit a
facility to only the considerate ones, obviously.  What strikes
me is that the undergrads rarely organize events for themselves,
and never organize events for undergrads and grads, even though
there exists a department budget for the DUG.  Natasha Gelfand
and Dan Price are interested in getting the DUG going again, so
maybe that is a good place for undergrads to take their concerns,
and use some of that money to improve undergraduate life in the
department.  Wouldn't you all feel better about undergrads coming
to TGIF, working in labs, etc, if the DUG sponsored some
undergrad/grad events as well?  I think I would.

Yes, I am... (unfortunately)  That was the wrong time for a new player to
pop in.  There was a lot of frustration and aggrivation and very high
traffic on the lists.  I decided then it was something I did not want to

Oh, it's never unfortunate to be who one is, I hope. :)

I don't know if this brief episode made it into Swann's Mousetrap Thesis, btw.
So you are on the verge of giving in to a (nearly) two-year itch, hmm ? ;)

The norm seems to be barely controlled chaos.  What varies is the
nature of the chaos. :)

An exception to what? To the provision that Players may not be bound
by texts that have not been made available to them?

It occurs to me that in the case of the Ruleset, R1513 may conflict
with R101. After all, doesn't R101 say that Jill has to abide by all
the Rules then in effect, period? Can R1513 attempt to restrict the
application of R101 without conflicting with it?

There are a number of things you might mean by that question. Players are
persons, and persons, unfortunately, can be blown to smithereens. So the
answer to your question is, in one sense, 'no, it doesn't mean that
Players cannot be blown to smithereens. This action is not prohibited
or regulated by the Rules at present, and so is already permitted by
R116. So your first sentence adds nothing to the current legislative
situation with regards to blowing Players to smithereens.

Assuming that "blown up" and "blown to smithereens" are synonymous,
the second sentence establishes the possibility of creating a legal
fiction to the effect that a Player has been blown to smithereens.
Of course, without other provisions in the Rules to say what the
legal effects of being blown to smithereens are (eg there might be
another Rule which says that you can't vote if you've been blown to 
smithereens), this possibility is something of an unengaged gear in
the Ruleset. It's also worth noting that in this case, the legal
fiction so created is so far from representing the truth of the
matter (since, the fiction to the contrary, no-one has actually been
blown to smithereens), that the phrase 'blown to smithereens' is really
doing no work other than to serve as a place-holder; we could as well
have replaced 'blown to smithereens' with 'come to have property X'
(and now you imagine that our other Rule says that you can't vote
if you have property X).

It's hard to remember, Vlad, exactly which debates you were around for
and which occurred while you were away, but I think you may find that
the attitude to legal deeming is more relaxed now than it has been in
the past. I think that now even former hardline opponents of legal
deeming like Chuck and Michael grudgingly admit that, appropriately
used in its its proper context, the use of legal deeming is acceptable
(I would go further and say that it's often indispensible).

The bext examples of the use of legal deeming in the Ruleset are,
in my opinion, R1668, R1715 and especially R880. I deliberately
don't include R1431, since Murphy elegantly demonstrated that the
Rule in that case could have been formulated as well without the use
of legal deeming.
