I suggested a day or two ago - I think it got lost in transit - that the
marks be replaced with multiple lists, with each Player appearing on at most
one list.  (Active List = Players recently On Hold.  Reserve List = other
Players.  Each week, the Registrar moves up to two Players onto the Duty
List, posts it - triggering a duty for all Players on it - then moves all
Players from the Duty List onto the Completed List.  Whenever all Players
are on the Completed List, they are moved onto the Active / Reserve List as
appropriate.)
