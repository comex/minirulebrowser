I disagree. In my opinion a Judge's reasoning does become part of Game Custom,
unless there is an appeal or a Concurring/Dissenting opinion in which another
conclusion is reached. It is not as deeply entrenched as the actual judgement,
though.

Scott's opinions on the fundamentals of the game are quite often in direct
conflict with game custom. He seems to have a policy of changing the game
fundamentals by arguing that they are meaningless and thus already void,
rather than by making clearcut Proposals.

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reaons and arguments:

Morendil's argument is in two parts: first he argues that the Herald
is not required to keep track of changes in Blots resulting from the
commission of Infractions; then he argues that no other Player is
required to keep track of such changes in Blots.

Let us take the second - and by far the trickier - of these arguments
first, and consider a specific example, that of the Infraction of
Failure to Report, defined in R1686. Morendil argues that the
Registrar is not required to report changes in Blots resulting from
the commission of this Infraction. There is a sense, not discussed by
Morendil, in which this is trivially true: no Rule actually requires
the Registrar to report the commission of the Infraction at all!
Strictly speaking, the Registrar has discretionary power not to report
the commission of this Infraction even if e is aware that the
Infraction has been committed. E is merely authorized to do so.

We should be wary, however, of drawing general conclusions from a
specific case such as this, for the Rules are not consistently
formulated in this respect.  So, while Tardiness (R1023) and
Dereliction of Duty (R1644) are treated like Failure to Report in that
a Player or group of Players are authorized but not required to report
the commission of the Infraction when it occurs, it could be argued
that in the case of Delayed COE Response (R1431), the Player who
posted the original Claim of Error *is* required to report the
incursion of a Blot penalty (the Rule says that the penalty is "to be
reported", which plausibly can be read as imposing a requirement to
report), and similar remarks apply to the Infraction of Excess
Proposing (R1065), and to other Infractions defined in the Rules.

Morendil's statement is, however, very general, claiming that "No
Player is currently required to report a change in Blots resulting
from the commission of an Infraction." The strategy we need then is
either to concentrate on Infractions like Delayed COE Response, or
just to assume in the case of Infractions like Failure to Report that
the Registrar does in fact report the commission of the Infraction,
and see what follows.

Well, what does follow? Regarding Delayed COE Response, we have this
statement from R1431:

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim.

Rule 1435 states:

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot. When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive. This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

while Rule 1504 states:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.

Question: what happens if I legally report the commission of the
Infraction of Delayed COE Response by posting to the PF: "Jill has
committed the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, and gains 1 Blot."?
In particular, does this message constitute the execution of a Payment
Order for 1 Indulgence from Jill to the Bank? Given the identification
of Blots with Payment Orders for Indulgences in R1435, I think the
answer is 'yes'.

It is crucial to note that the question here is *not* whether the
simple reporting of the commission of the Infraction (without
mentioning the Blot penalty) constitutes the execution of a PO for
Indulgences. On that question, I agree with Morendil that these are
not identical. But that observation is of no use to us here, because
here we are concerned with changes in Blots. If I post the PF merely
that "Jill has committed the Infraction of Delayed COE Response.",
then I have not yet done all that R1431 requires me to do, since I am
also required to report that Jill has earned a 1 Blot penalty. This is
important because Morendil's argument relies at this point on the
claim that, in general, all that a Player who is required to report
the commission of an Infraction is required to do is report the
commission of the Infraction, and no more. But in at least one case -
Delayed COE Response - we find a counterexample to that claim. Merely
reporting the Infraction is not enough; I have to report the Blot
penalty also. In fact, even in a case like Failure to Report, where
the relevant Rule (1686) makes no specific mention of a Blot penalty,
the reference to a penalty "the same as...for a Class D crime" is
enough to ensure, via R1504, that if the Registrar does report the
commission of the Infraction, then e is required to execute a PO for
Indulgences, and hence report a change in Blots. So, after extensive
argumentation, we can see that the second part of Morendil's argument
fails.

[It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence of R1504 states that "Penalties for
Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal report". But the
legal report of what: the penalties or the infractions? If infractions
is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension with itself, since it
immediately goes on to imply (along with other Rules, eg R1599) that
the application of the penalty can be later than the report of the
Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that penalties for Infractions
are applied at the time the penalty is reported, which can be later
than the time the Infraction is reported.]

Turning now to the first part of Morendil's argument, we can see much
more straightforwardly that it too fails. Morendil argues that the
Herald is not required to report changes in Blots.

The responsibilities of Recordkeepors with respect to their Currencies
are set out in Rules 1578 and 1596:

1578: The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to maintain a record
      of the amounts of that Currency held by the various entities
      which possess units of that Currency.

1596: Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.

Regarding the relationship between Indulgences and Blots, the Rules
are reasonably clear. "A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence," says R1435,
"the payee of which is the Bank, is called a Blot." This seems pretty
straightforward.  Blots are outstanding Payment Orders for
Indulgences, including (not excluding, pace Morendil) disputed Payment
Orders.  Vacated Payment Orders don't count as outstanding Payment
Orders, which seems to me to be the purpose of the clarificatory
language (which is what I take it to be) in the second paragraph of
R1435.

A 'change in Blots', then, is simply a change in the number of
non-vacated outstanding Payment Orders for Indulgences which have been
assessed against a Player. Now we come to Morendil's first point: he
argues that no Rule specifically requires the Herald to keep track of
changes in the number of non-vacated outstanding Payment Orders for
Indulgences which have been assessed against a Player. (Or rather,
this is the argument he offers after one has corrected the mistake he
makes about whether disputed Payment Orders for Indulgences count as
Blots.) This claim is, strictly speaking, correct. No Rules
specifically makes such a requirement. But that is because no Rule
needs specifically to make such a requirement. Such a requirement is
already implicit in the more general requirement set out in R1596 that
the Herald maintain records of all Payment Orders for Indulgences and
their statuses, be they satisfied, disputed or vacated. In fulfilling
this requirement, the Herald will, ipso facto, be keeping track of any
change in the number of non-vacated Payment Orders for Indulgences,
and hence, in the number of Blots.

This is enough to show that the Statement is FALSE, for the argument
given above shows that Herald is required to keep track of, and hence
ultimately to Report (via R1377), changes in Blots resulting from the
commission of Infractions.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

A Recordkeepor is a Player who is required to maintain a record of
past and present Payment Orders naming a particular Currency. To
fulfill these obligations, it is necessary, and sufficient, that a
Player should be able, if called upon to do so under Rule 1064 (FOIA),
to provide upon request a list of all Payment Orders naming that
particular Currency that have been executed in the last four Weeks,
and their status.

No additional obligation is imposed upon a Recordkeepor with respect
to Payment Orders, or to any given set of Payment Orders. In
particular, a Currency Recordkeepor is not required to keep track of
"changes in the total amount of Payment Orders executed, but not
disputed or vacated", which is the long-winded expansion of the legal
shorthand "a change in Blots". A Recordkeepor is a fortiori not
required to *report* such changes, which makes Rule 1435's designation
of "whomever is required to report the change in Blots" vacuuous.

To sum up : if I were the Recordkeepor for Indulgences, no Rule could
currently _require_ me to post a message to the Public Forum whenever
a Player's Blots changed.

Are some other Players required to post reports of such changes ? This
responsibility could conceivably fall to Players required to post
Reports of Infractions. The reasoning would be : "A report of an
Infraction committed by a particular Player leads to a Blot penalty
assessed against that Player, and thus constitutes a report of a
change in Blots".

This inference, however, misses one crucial step. A "change in Blots"
is the result of a Payment Order in Indulgences being executed. But
the report of an Infraction is not, in and of itself, a Payment Order,
and thus the requirement to report an Infraction cannot simultaneously
constitute a requirement to report a change in Blots.

A solution to this problem would be to enact Implicit Payment Orders,
the mirror image of Implicit Transfer Orders, which - employed with
the same caution which was reserved to ITOs - would restore reports of
Crimes and Infractions to their full effectiveness.

> Judgement:    FALSE

This was an interesting Judgement, and I commend Steve for once more 
producing an outstanding effort of judicial analysis in eir Judgement of this
CFJ. I certainly no longer have a cause to claim that the issues I raised in
this matter were not adressed.

However (y'all knew that was coming) I find fault in the finer details of
Steve's reasoning on a few critical points, and find that some of the
interpretative decisions upon which Steve's Judgement essentially rests would be
more properly addressed by an Appeals Court, as they have wider implications
than merely the legal status of pending Indulgence POs.

Therefore, I hereby :
* call for the Appeal of the Judgement in CFJ 937
* state on the behalf of Elde, as Elde's Executor, that Elde joins in the 
   Appeal;
* state on the behalf of Elde, as Elde's Executor, that Elde, on the behalf 
   of Blob, acting as Blob's Executor, states that Blob joins in the Appeal.

Following are some remarks on the parts of Steve's argument that I believe are
contentious.

===

> There is a sense, not discussed by Morendil, in which this is trivially true:
> no Rule actually requires the Registrar to report the commission of the
> Infraction at all!

I did not discuss this because I felt it to be the more obvious part of the
argument. There is indeed no requirement to report Infractions in general, and
thus there is no requirement to report Blot changes resulting specifically from
the commission of Infractions inherent in the general Rules for Infractions.

To prove the Statement FALSE, it is therefore sufficient to prove, either that
there is a Player who is required to report all changes in Blots in general; or
that there is a requirement on some Player to report all or some changes in
Blots resulting from the commission of an Infraction, and to that extent I agree
with Steve's analysis.

> It could be argued that in the case of Delayed COE Response (R1431), the
> Player who posted the original Claim of Error *is* required to report the
> incursion of a Blot penalty (the Rule says that the penalty is "to be
> reported", which plausibly can be read as imposing a requirement to report), 

I humbly disagree and find this a contrived, rather than plausible, reading of
R1431 or other Rules using the construction 'to be reported by X'. We need look
no further for an explanation of this phrase than Rule 1503, which states

   Any Rule that defines an Infraction must also specify a Player or Players who
   are authorized to detect and report the commission of that Infraction;
   otherwise, the Infraction carries no penalty.

This clearly underlines the use of 'to be reported by X' in the context of a
Rule dealing with Infractions as a 'phrase of art', i.e. the usual and approved
manner of specifying which 'Player or Players [are] authorized to detect and
report the commission of that Infraction'.

Much (if not most !) of Steve's rebuttal of the 'second part' of my own
argument rests upon this dubious reading, however, so I can only hope that the
Justices considering this Appeal will issue a decision on this issue.

> Question: what happens if I legally report the commission of the Infraction of
> Delayed COE Response by posting to the PF: "Jill has committed the Infraction
> of Delayed COE Response, and gains 1 Blot."? In particular, does this message
> constitute the execution of a Payment Order for 1 Indulgence from Jill to the
> Bank? Given the identification of Blots with Payment Orders for Indulgences in
> R1435, I think the answer is 'yes'.

I'm afraid that the answer is not as simple. In particular, answering 'yes' to
this question on the grounds that Blots are POs _assumes_ that Steve, in this
hypothetical example of reporting Jill's infraction, is authorized to execute
Payment Orders in Indulgences corresponding to Blot penalties. However, the crux
of my own argument is that if the Statement in CFJ 937 is TRUE, then Steve is in
such a case *not* authorized to execute such POs, and therefore the answer is
'no'. I'm afraid the reasoning that follows from assuming an answer of 'yes' is
therefore inacceptable.

> In fact, even in a case like Failure to Report, where the relevant Rule (1686)
> makes no specific mention of a Blot penalty, the reference to a penalty "the
> same as...for a Class D crime" is enough to ensure, via R1504, that if the
> Registrar does report the commission of the Infraction, then e is required to
> execute a PO for Indulgences, and hence report a change in Blots.

I must also take issue with this last inference. Steve states that e agrees that
the Report of an Infraction is not identical with a report of a change in Blots,
and that is trivially correct. I argue the subtler point that "being required to
execute a PO in indulgences" is not identical to "being required to report a
change in Blots", even though executing a PO in Indulgences _causes_ a change in
Blots, and coincidentally (since executing a PO is done by posting to the PF)
announces the same fact. If it were possible, say, to execute POs by sending
them directly to the Player and RecordKeepor involved, then no requirement to
execute a PO would conceivably be equivalent to a requirement to report same.

> Blots are outstanding Payment Orders for Indulgences, including (not 
> excluding, pace Morendil) disputed Payment Orders.

I must apologize for the mistake and any confusion resulting from it.

Steve's critique of the first part of part of my argument is potentially more
fruitful, in that if it can conclusively be shown that the requirement to
publish "The Currency Records for Indulgences" (R1377) includes, explicitly or
explicitly, a requirement to report "changes in Blots" in general, then my
argument that the Herald is not required to report Blot changes will indeed be
disproved.

Of the recordkeeping provisions of Rule 1596, Steve states:

> In fulfilling this requirement, the Herald will, ipso facto, be keeping
> track of any change in the number of non-vacated Payment Orders for
> Indulgences, and hence, in the number of Blots. This is enough to show that
> the Statement is FALSE, for the argument given above shows that Herald is
> required to keep track of, and hence ultimately to Report (via R1377), changes
> in Blots resulting from the commission of Infractions.

Earlier in his argument Steve warns of the perils of extrapolating from the
particular to the general. It is true that the Assessor and Promotor are
respectively required to _report_ changes in VTs and P-Notes, by Rules 1696 and
1701. The Herald is in addition required by 1377 to report changes in Honor. But
these are specific exceptions to the general rule that Currency Reports are
required only to contain current information.

The Herald is only required to report Currency information for Indulgences,
which 1596 only requires to includes current information. That the Herald is
required to _keep_track_ of changes thereto may be a consequence of the
requirements of 1596 (though I dispute even that). But I contend that being
required to _know_ of some information, specifically when, why, and by how much
each Player's Blots changed, does not carry a requirement to_publish_ that
information, even under FOIA (which, ironically, did at some time include a
provision requiring the publication of any changes occurring between request and
publication, but no longer does - does anyone know since when ?) 

To put it another way, if I were Herald and in between two of my Reports, 3
Indulgence POs were executed naming Blob, for a total of 10 Blots, I would be
able to fulfill my duties under 1596 without having to disclose the particulars
of any Blot change - thus my contention that I would not be "required to report
Blot changes".

It's only natural that I as the litigant should do my best to provide the 
appropriate authorities with the necessary documentation. :)

True - but as Herald you are presumably sufficiently aware of the Rules
governing Indulgences, and of CFJ 932 which only recently still disputed all
extant Indulgence POs, to be able to judge the import of 937.

> So I am forced to apply judicial reasoning even to determine whether any POs

I don't see why. A PO is disputed when there is a CFJ "challenging its
legaliy". Given recent Judicial activity (e.g. 932), I think it is clear that
the intent of CFJ 937 is precisely to challenge the legality of most (if not
all) POs in Indulgences executed up to this point, and I strenuously dispute all
such POs. The existence of CFJ 937 should be sufficient, its content is
irrelevant.

It seems to me that you are applying a double standard here. You assert that a
Judge's reasoning becomes part and parcel of Game Custom if unchallenged, and in
one specific instance, Vlad's Judgement, you are prepared to draw conclusions
from a Judge's reasoning that reach far beyond the scope of the actual Statement
and its truth or falsity, yet you claim that since a Judgement of either TRUE or
FALSE in 937 would not necessarily lead to conclusions as to the validity of
Indulgence POs 937 does not challenge these POs. What if the Judge's reasoning
in 937 did state that POs were invalid, then ? You would have to turn around and
state that 937 did challenge such POs, wouldn't you ?

Lastly, it seems clear to me, from Steve's reasoning in eir recently published
Judgement of this same CFJ, that the legality of Indulgence POs was very much at
the heart of the matter.

Oh, I agree completely - the question here is not one of practicality, rather,
what is at issue is a legal point - whether the Rules _require_ anyone in
particular to report Blot changes, and consequently whether the Rules authorize
any Player to submit Indulgence POs.

Well, I just checked the Rules - and find that the CotC is only required to 
publish the Judge's decision of TRUE or FALSE; I see nothing in there that 
requires the CotC to actually publish the arguments and reasoning submitted by 
a Judge, which apparently Judges post only because it's customary to do so. 
Given the principle that a Player can't be bound by a text that e has not been 
'made aware of', which I personally interpret as any text which there isn't a 
requirement to publish or a Rule guaranteeing the availability of, such as 
FOIA, I strongly suspect that a Judge's reasoning has no legal significance 
whatsoever.

I think 'person' as used in the Rules is a term that has been given special
meaning by Game Custom, and that this term could reasonably be interpreted to
include 'multiple' persons. I prefer this interpretation to giving the word a 
technical meaning that is not justified by any Rule.

However, all the previous CFJs directly challenged the legality of Indulgence
POs and all were resolved in favor of the legality of Indulgence POs.

It was clear from your comments that your intention was to dispute the legality
of Indulgence POs.  The question was, did your CFJ actually do that.  The
contents of the CFJ are hardly irrelevant to making that determination and I
would be remiss in my duties if I were to ignore the contents.  The mere
existence of a CFJ is not enough to dispute anything.  Contents are all.

I think a Judges reasoning in an unchallenged verdict should carry much more
weight than a Caller's reasoning in eir arguments.  Personally, I don't think a
caller's argument should carry any weight wrt game custom until accepted by the
Judicial process.  Of course, I think the caller's arguments should be given
all due respect and consideration by Judges.  From my point of view, I have not
applied a double standard here.

Let me answer the last question first.  I would not say that CFJ 937 challenged
the validity of POs given your hypothetical.  I would say that the Judge's
reasoning, if accepted into game custom, invalidated them.  It would be fair to
say that your CFJ then *indirectly* challenged the validity of Indulgence POs. 
I interpret the PO dispute Rule to mean a CFJ that directly challenges the
validity of a PO.

Here's the way I see the current situation.  CFJ 937 was really the antecedent
to a *possible* challenge of Indulgence POs.  If judged True, then it *might*
be true that Indulgence POs were invalid.  In the absence of reasoning by the
Judge of 937 wrt to that validity (shortcutting the disputation of those POs),
it would require another CFJ to establish that fact.  The second CFJ is the one
I would consider to have brought Indulgence POs into dispute.  OTOH, if you had
made the second CFJ directly challenging the validity of Blot POs first, and
used the statement of 937 as caller's arguments, *then* I would have
automatically considered Induglence POs to be in dispute.  And we would not be
having this interesting discussion.  8)

Bah.  H. CotC, I hereby Call for Judgement on the following statement:

     Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has
     been read by a Player, then it shall not lack the power to require
     that Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the
     Rules fail to require that it be made available to that Player.

Caller's Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".
