I must have missed some mail: I've seen neither the Official publication
of my Judgement, nor Morendil's reply to it. Can some one send me the
reply?

I haven't seen Morendil's critique of my Judgement, but let me say
that I have no problem whatsover with his having used his current
unusual status as Executor in Probate of two 'defunct' Players
in order to initiate an Appeal.

Odd in the real world, yes, but not in Agora. RL has no R1478.

I'm another Pragmatist without children. But I'm also newly and happily
not single.

It would appear that Zefram is correct: R1682 says nothing about
non-Players. The next Report will contain a correction.

What spelling errors does the Report contain? (Not that I'm claiming
that there aren't any - I'd just like to know what they are.)

In my opinion Murphy's argument is correct and the CFJ should be judged
TRUE. Are you going somewhere with this, Murphy?
