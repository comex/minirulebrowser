This would be my interpretation.  R101 takes precedence over R1513, forcing
Players to obey the Rules in any case.

I thought judicial precdent interpreted 101 as enjoining
obedience to the Rules as a whole, not individually. Since
1513 is part of the Rules, it is no violation of 101 to
obey it. We argued long ago that a Rule limiting the
obedience required of certain Player(s) to certain Rule(s)
did not violate 101.
    Based on game custom, that is correct. I was never entirely
happy, however, with the original judgment.

But it's a close call.  Rule 101 says "the Rules then in effect".  If
Rule 1513 stated that a body of law "has no effect" if it has not been
made available, then there would be no conflict.  I suspect I would
have a hard time answering the question were I asked to judge whether
a Rule, the text of which had not been made available, was therefore a
Rule not presently in effect by the virtues of Rule 1513.

Hmm.  Interesting.  How does one obey the Rules as a whole without obeying
individual Rules?  Unless there are Rules that conflict, I don't see how this
would be possible.  If there *are* Rules that conflict, I don't see how it is
possible to obey the Rules as a whole unless there is a method for resolving
such conflicts (as we have with the precedence Rules).  

Given this, why should R101 be immune from being in conflict with other Rules? 
If we had another Rule that said, "Player's are not required to obey the Rules
if it is the third Tuesday of a month with an 'r' in it's name" that would
certainly be considered to conflict with R101 and we would say that R101 takes
precedence over it.  I don't see the logical difference between this and R1513
which, as interpreted this way wrt to the Rules, says "Player's are not
required to obey the Rules if the Rules have not been made available to them".

I'd also be interested to see how one could craft a rule limiting the obedience
required of certain Player(s) to certain Rule(s) without creating a conflict
between the new rule and the certain Rule(s).  Seems to me you would have to
set up the correct precedence relationships to make it work.

Yes, but "the Rules then in effect" means "in effect" wrt to what or whom?  I
wouldn't have a hard time interpreting this to mean "in effect wrt to the
current game state".  This seems to me to be the most natural interpretation.

How can there ever be a rule, "the text of which had not been made
available"? It must have been published on several occasions: as a
proposal, then as a successful proposal together with the voting
results, and (admittedly with a possible delay of a few days) in the
Rule Set.

1513 ia about non-rule entities - these may be created without being
public, and that is why regulations like 1513 are needed. But proper
rules, er, Rules? They are public anyway.

I think the exception comes when you have a new player without web access
who decides to start doing things before the weekly ruleset posting.  It's
a rare circumstance, but it could possibly happen -- maybe :)

I would suggest that the rules be changed such that the act of a person
registering in itself confirms that e has received a copy of the rules.

Methinks it would be a good idea to register soon...  since I am at a point
where I'm participating and wish I could make proposals :)

agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au

Also, is it being made a Public Forum? :)

Agora-discussion. It's a non-PF to avoid making a player who might,
theoretically, want to play without getting all that email subscribe to
it.

No.

What's the use of having it then?  Why would anyone send anything to a

Um... to talk and discuss things, like we're doing now? A PF has a couple
of special implications (not an exhaustive list):
1) Anything sent to a PF is legally considered to have been sent to all
players.
2) Some game actions may only be done by posting to a PF.
3) All players are legally required to subscribe to every PF.

agora-discussion is a non-public-forum because it's not used for 1) or 2),
and thus there's no point in requiring 3). Even though it's not a Public
Forum, you can still use it as a means of communication, just not an
official one.

In addition to allowing Players to participate actively without having to
subject themselves to the constant jabbering and philosophizing that goes on in
the discussion list (although I personally find that this is where most of the
fun is), it is also very convenient when you go on an extended leave of
absence.  You can catch up on the game state easily without having to wade
through a *lot* of mail.

1. Keeps the PF archive a bit smaller.
2. Lets people play without having read the huge volumes of mail that
   sometimes fill the discussion group.
3. You can lie in the discussion group. :)

Actually, the Registrar has no required duties because of my registration,
as this is not the first time I have registered.  This doesn't mean that I
don't want him to perform those duties, I just thought I'd point it out.

i.e. Send that there Welcome Wagon on over to these here parts! :)

I would prefer the phrase 'legal fiction' to 'legal deeming' - and 
reflect that fiction has always had its uses and its aesthetic worth,
in nearly all human endeavors. ;)

However, you are, I believe, entitled to a Grace Period, since it is
been more than 12 months since your last registration.  I think.

Of course, you have done nothing here but replace "is considered to
have appointed" with "implicitly appoints"; you're still establishing
a legal fiction that the resigning Officer has appointed the Speaker
as successor, when e has, in fact, not.

Not to mention that "legal fiction" is the generally accepted term of

I think that the "in effect" is a holdover from the Initial Set,
where it is there to make it clear that repealed Rules do not
have to be obeyed.  Given a strong Game Custom that repealed Rules
are no longer Rules, it is probably unnecessary.

This is nomic, remember?  All of those requirements to be

1. As a courtesy to those who don't want to receive mere discussion.
2. As a courtesy to those who sort mail according to which list
   it's on, and may thus postpone reading it.
3. It's not subject to TIA (R1497).

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

Is that what you wanted?  Please elucidate what you want elucidated. :)

I disagree--I would say I have redefined "appointed" to mean something
other than its normal usage.  And Agora has a long and proud
tradition of doing that. :)

To make an analogy, my current Location is the Rulekeepor's Office.
In fact, I am currently (as I write this, of course) seated in
a computer lab on the University of Wisconsin campus.  Do the
Rules establish a legal fiction as to my location?  No, I would
argue, they have redefined "Location" to mean something quite
different from my actual position.  There is a similar distinction
in my example above.  To highlight the distinction, suppose we
had the following Rule: "A player may not send any messages to
the PF while in a University of Wisconsin computer lab."  If the
location rules were establishing a legal fiction as to
my location, I would not be violating that Rule by sending
this message.  If the location rules instead redefine "Location",
(as I argue), then I would be violating that Rule.

In fact, definition vs. fiction is at the heart of many of
my preferred non-deeming versions of rules.  Why say "A Player
is considered to be On Hold..." when you can more simply and more
clearly state "A Player is On Hold?"  If you only want to
consider a Player to be On Hold for a single Rule, and treated
as Off Hold for all other Rules, then the legal fiction is
reasonable, but in more general cases--such as R880--it is not.

I thought of that argument, too, but I think this is a different
case. The Judgement you're talking about, which I am happy with,
tells us that if two Rules conflict, it's perfectly OK to obey one
(the one with higher precedence) and ignore the other. This is
in accordance with the Rules, collectively.

In this case, however, R101 is itself directly involved in the conflict.
It says that Players must abide by all the Rules then in effect. R1513
seeks to overturn this, since it implies that you don't have to obey a
Rule in effect if its text has not been made available to you. But that
just conflicts with R101, which cares nothing for text-availability.

I think this is the best argument I have yet seen that R101 is not vacuous.

Another good point! Consider, however, this counter: the Rule is,
in a general sense, 'in effect', since it remains binding on those
Players to whom it has been made available.

This amounts to the claim that we should not distinguish more finely
as to effectiveness of a Rule than simply to say that a Rule is in
effect if it is binding on any Player. If we want to have Rules which
are binding on some Players and not on others (and why not?), then
we should talk in those terms, ie, whether text T binds Player P at
time t.

Definition: A Rule R is in effect at time t if and only if the text
of R binds at least one Player P at t.

Although I suggested just this only 2 days ago, some of the replies have
made me rethink. The Rulekeepor is required to provide a copy of the
Ruleset on request, and this is probably enough to make the Ruleset
count as available to anyone with access to email. We'd have to complicate
the conditions in the example considerably to make it an exception to that.
But perhaps it still could be done.

Scott was referring to your Grace Period award under R1677.

Can we repeal R1494, please?

Ah, yes, I knew that there was a really good example that I was
missing, but I couldn't remember where it was. R1527 doesn't use
the words 'deemed' or 'considered', so I didn't find it.

You actually prefer that wording to the present one? Ah well, there's
no accounting for taste...

In my usage 'legal deeming' picks out the practice, 'legal fiction'
picks out the results of employing the practice.

OK, others have answered this question repeatedly. I'd just like to take
this opportunity to encourage Players to stop using the backup lists now
that the primary lists are up and running smoothly.

Would it not be possible to rephrase "shall be taken to have been

or "shall acquire legal significance sequentially..."

It depends on the definition of "in effect". 1513 may simply be
saying that Rules are not in effect for Players who have not received
them.

P.S. Philosophical question: What sort of act would constitute a 
violation of 101?

I prefer the term "establishing legal fictions", since "deeming"
unduly ties it to only one of the many possible ways of framing such
constructions.

Following my usage, 'deeming' is not tied to any particular construction.
It is certainly not tied to the specific use of the word 'deem'. Any
construction which has as its effect the creation of a legal fiction
will be an example of legal deeming.

Yep.  I'm not interested in playing a game with unknown
Rules.  (And yes, I have played Mao.  I didn't particularly
like it.)

Precisely my point.

In Ackanomic, any violation of the Rules is considered a violation of
Rule 101, and the CFCJ (Call for Criminal Judgement) is captioned
"Player X violated Rule 101, in that e ..." (or something like that,
it's been ages since I looked at Ackanomic).
