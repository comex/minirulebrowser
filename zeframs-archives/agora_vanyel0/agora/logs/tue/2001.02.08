This is quite simple: The CotC is required to announce all Judicial Salaries:
Rule 502 clearly states:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

Thus, the CotC has this obligation, see Rule 1479:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to pay out one or more
      Properties to some entity, the Bank shall incur a debt to that
      entity for those Properties, and the named Player shall, as
      soon as possible, post a public notice of the debt.

Of course, the problem in this case, is whether the CotC or the Justiciar
bears this responsibility. I think this is included in what is taken over
under Rule 1831, but I am not sure. However, no Rule forbids double
announcements, so you can still make the announcement both without problems.

I believe Wes has already announced announced the debt, and lee has
already paid it. If make an announcement now, won't loh get paid twice?
