Did our first President like music? Why did he pay 15 shillings 
to Proctor's band of music? Why did he appoint an Inspector of Music? 
What music books did he buy for his step-daughter?
For the answers to these questions, see "George Washington:
Music for the First President", a Book, CD and Tape. These are all 
available at <http://www.virtualdancing.com>  .
These recent publications contain tunes, songs, minuets and country
dances which commemorate Washington's life and career.
Notable among the 23 selections are: The President's March; 
He Comes, The Hero Comes!; Mount Vernon; Lady Washington (Saw you my 
hero George?; The Death of General Wolfe (Brave Wolfe); and two dirges 
written in honor of George Washington.
Performers for the CD and Tape were David and Ginger Hildebrand.
The Companion Music Book was prepared by Kate Van Winkle Keller.
