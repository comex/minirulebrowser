Indeed.  It is entirely possible to adopt unenforceable or virtually
unenforceable Rules, either because their enforcement is
epistemologically impossible or because no reasonable person would
submit to their enforcement.

OK. Well, the good news is that the two gecko lists that I've created
basically work. Apparently the problem that I and I alone have been having
receviing mail from the gecko lists is the results of some weird
interaction with filter. So I've turned filter off for the nonce,
and voila! messages are reaching me. In a minute, I'll create 
agora-business.

The remaining issue is digesting and archiving. None of the lists
as currently set up support digesting or archiving. Getting them to
do so is something I'm prepared to attempt, but it looks pretty
complicated and may lead to more troubles. Do people want to move
to the gecko lists before archiving and digesting are set up for
them?

While you think about that: I hereby announce my intention to
designate Without Objection the mailing lists at

<agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au> and
<agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>

as Public Fora, in accordance with R478.

Also, I think I'll just manually subscribe everyone who is
subscribed to the yoyo list.
