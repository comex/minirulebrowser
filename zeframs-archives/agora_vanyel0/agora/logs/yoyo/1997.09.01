I should note that it is improper for you to call for Nominations for
the Office of Registrar, as this is my duty as Speaker. 

I therefore call for Nominations for the Office of Registrar; the
Nominating Period to last one week, commencing as of this message.

I'm not the Ambassador, but I know as a player of Rishonomic that, as soon as the new game is 
properly up and running, New Rishonomic will be submitting a proposal to properly fix the Members 
list.

I would say that it's pretty clear that they're not, since the communications on the Rishon list 
will back up the fact that the players specifically ended the original game and began a new one, 
with different Rules.

Directly between the Nomics, of course. For example, just before I

by Agora players - they'd simply register as players there and do
things. No IN needed for that.

I vote AGAINST on the Referendum on this IN proposal, for the following
reasons:

1. 'forbidden from altering the Ackanomic game state in any way whatsoever'
   is much too harsh
2. I don't think this Proposal will do what it wants to do: It cannot
   change the Ackanomic Ruleset. It can put an obligation on Ackanomic
   to change their ruleset, but it cannot do so itself.

I vote for INP 364. Personally, I think it is quite pointless, but I
would still like to see what happens if it is accepted.

Because Rule 1632 states that the VP "shall last for one week, or until
one week before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant
InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest."  The latter time
stricture should probably be shortened.

Why is the member's list being stored in a rule in the first place?
Doesn't it make more sense for the  moderator to hold the list of voting
members just the same as he holds the list of non-voting members?

Many Nomics put their Player List in a Rule.  There are arguments both
for and against this practice, and I don't think there's a conclusive
answer as to which is better.  I suspect it depends on the character
of the Nomic.

You take it correctly, as far as I'm concerned. 
Rishonomic no longer exists.  BTW, New Rishonomic
does *not* have the "offending" statement in it's
current Ruleset (yet).
