<h1>Yoyo</h1>
For the first year of its existence, Agora conducted all business,
discussion, etc. over the Yoyo server.  By August of 1994 there was
clearly a <em>lot</em> of mail going through, so we got the other
mailing lists going at teleport.com, with one for discussion and the
other for official stuff.  After various other developments, a business
list got added, and eventually a fifth list to serve as backup.  Now
Yoyo and Tue are the backup servers, for when the others go down.  All
Players are required to be subscribed to Yoyo.
