That's because, AFAIK, I never did more than proto it. Okay, since nobody has 
commented, here it is:

H.Ambassador, I hereby submit the following Internomic Proposal:
####
No member nomic of Internomic may claim to be the greatest of all Nomics. If it
is correctly brought to the attention of the Speaker that a member nomic has
claimed to be the greatest of all nomics, e will post a report of this to the
public forum. When the Speaker posts such a report correctly:

  * The nomic claiming to be great must recant, through eir liason, in a 
    message of at least 500 words within a week or be expelled from Internomic
    until such a time as this occurs. This takes precedence over any rule which 
    would make em a member of Internomic.
  * The nomic claiming to be great is subject to ridicule from all the other 
    nomics in Internomic, and becomes a non-voting member if it is a voting
    member. This takes precedence over any rule defining the voting members.
####

You have the power of negation.
