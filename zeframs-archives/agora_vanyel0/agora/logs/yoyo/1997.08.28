Certainly more concepts are required, but the system provides
considerably more functionality than the old system.

One thing that Rule 116 tells us is that, in the absence of other Rules
which prohibit it, it's perfectly legal to attempt to alter the course
of the game by hacking files. But other Rules arguably do prohibit it,
at least for some things.

Well, Blob and Elde won't be subscribing off their own bat. Blob did
ask to be added to the gecko lists when they're up and running and I
assume he'd want to be added to the win.tue.nl list, too, You'll
have to do it manually, Andre.

I believe you when you say that. Blob will be added. The address
malcolmr@cse.unsw.edu.au will be added to the subscribers of agora@win.tue.nl
In Elde's case I will regard it enough for now that Morendil is subscribed,
which leaves us with only Kolja still missing.

Of course you could add Kolja manually aswell...When the gecko lists
are ready (and progress is being made), I may add all current players
and watchers manually.

In the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal, the Mint was destroyed before the
Mintor of VTs was changed to the Bank (formerly the Mint's Treasury.)
