Minor Crisis

One more try, this time to yoyo.

Below is a message I sent to agora-business on Friday, but I have not seen it
yet.  I'm going to try this backup list and see if things come through it.  The
Kudo transfer below is presented as backup to the original transfer - it is not
meant as an additional transfer.

-- Crito

In preparing the R-O-M selection this week, I finally noticed this was
published by Assessor Steve on May 08, 1998:

>Create a Rule with this text:

>      Upon the creation of this Rule:
>        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
>        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
>            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
>        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
>            that Player's possession.

>      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.

Interestingly, nobody else seems to have noticed this either, when looking at
the latest Accountor and P-Note reports, since nobody made a COE on them. 
Needless to say, there were severe consequences as a result of this Rule being
created.  I am about to publish a corrected Accountor and P-Note report, plus
an amended Proposal Queue (only one priority change was affected).  This
constitutes a COE on the latest of those three reports.

Please note the failed Transfer Orders that may affect you.  Unfortunately
Chancellor Michael is going to have to mint some VTs and re-issue quite a few
TOs because of my inattention.  For this I apologize profusely and hereby
transfer a Kudo FROM myself for failing to take proper cognizance of the
effects of proposal passages TO Michael as compensation for the extra work I've
caused em.  Steve, you should also note that your promised rewards for the
P-Notes paid by other Players for your "Levers" proposal were wiped out.

EMAIL MARKETING WORKS!!

Bull's Eye Gold is the PREMIER email address collection tool.
This program allows you to develop TARGETED lists of email
addresses.  Doctors, florists, MLM, biz opp,...you can collect
anything...you are only limited by your imagination!  You can
even collect email addresses for specific states, cities, and
even countries!  All you need is your web browser and this program.
Our software utilizes the latest in search technology called
"spidering". By simply feeding the spider program a starting
website it will collect for hours. The spider will go from website
to targeted website providing you with thousands upon thousands of
fresh TARGETED email addresses. When you are done collecting,  the
spider removes duplicates and saves the email list in a ready to
send format. No longer is it necessary to send millions of ads to
get a handful of responses...SEND LESS...EARN MORE!!!

A terrific aspect of the Bull's Eye software is that there is
no difficult set up involved and no special technical mumbo-jumbo
to learn. All you need to know is how to search for your targeted
market in one of the many search engines and let the spider do the
rest! Not familiar with the search engines? No problem, we provide
you with a list of all the top search engines. Just surf to the
location of a search engine on your browser then search for the
market you wish to reach...it's that easy!

For instance if you were looking for email addresses of Doctors
in New York all you would do is:

1) Do a search using your favorite search engine by typing in
the words doctor(s) and New York
2) Copy the URL (one or more)...that's the stuff after the
http://...  for instance it might look like
http://www.yahoo.com/?doctor(s)/?New+York
3) Press the START button

THAT's IT!!!  The Bull's Eye spider will go to all the websites
that are linked, automatically extracting the email addresses
you want.

The spider is passive too! That means you can let it run all
day or all night while you are working on important things or
just having fun on your computer. There is no need to keep a
constant watch on it, just feed it your target market and give
it praise when it delivers thousands of email addresses at
the end of the day!
