Everything's okay on this end. I've certainly been getting Agora mail; I've
gotten 70+ messages today. If there is a problem, it's probably with my
alias -- <harlequin@tmbg.org> is just a mail alias that points to my
regular box. If there's ever a problem with it, I can still be reached at
<particle@servtech.com>.

Plus there tends to be a limit on how many files (regardless of their size)
a given filesystem can contain, and implementing this concept would bring
the system closer to that limit.

Players input text into the program as a Proposal. The program gets inputs
from the Players, and if the inputs sum in a particular way the text within

This is the way I'd like to handle it. As it is, it wouldn't require too
much modification WRT the entities themselves -- almost all the Entities we
have now are listed and maintained in some report (and, until/unless I get
rid of it, *all* of them are -- as the Frankenstein Monster(s) are listed
by the Chancellor.)

I wholeheartedly agree with this. Where's the fun in only being able to do
what the Rules let you? :) Seriously, I suggest that, if we do undergo such
a reform (and we certainly need to) we should try to go with such a system.

PROTO-Proposal: Cartography Cleanup

Amend Rule 1706 ("The Agoraverse") by deleting the text reading:

      The Cartographor is authorized to change the name of any
      Location not specifically mentioned by name in the Rules
      Without Objection.

Create a rule entitled "Cartographor's Powers" with the text:

      The Cartographor is authorized to create a Location
      Without Objection.

      The Cartographor is authorized to destroy any Location 
      not specifically mentioned by name in the Rules Without 
      Objection.

      The Cartographor is authorized to change the name of any
      Location not specifically mentioned by name in the Rules
      Without Objection.
  
      The Cartographor is authorized to make any two Locations
      Adjacent to each other Without Objection.

      The Cartographor is authorized to make any two Adjacent
      Locations un-Adjacent Without Objection.

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") by adding the text "only" between the text
"Entities may" and the text "move to a Location."

As long as the Rules are written in such a way that it defines voting in
the form of "A Player Votes by XXX..." or something similar, this is not a
problem -- it simply allows the player who voted to submit a new voting
message to supercede the original message with a new one. Making changing
of such a body of text impossible is also easy -- merely state that a
Player may not create a new XXXX after e already has one.

I doubt that (a) is the case. (b) is certainly a possibility. I'd
been using procmail for years without a single hitch before it 
started to behave badly. Perhaps they installed - badly - an updated
version of the software on the system.

The problem, inasmuch as I was able to discover it, appeared to
be this: occasionally, for whatever reason, perhaps something to
do with a system crash, procmail would leave a lock file in my
home directory. Subsequently, every piece of incoming mail would
spawn a procmail process that would just hang around unable to
complete its tasks, until maxprocesses was exceeded. Soon after
that the system would crash.

I suspect it may have been a bit more complicated than that.
Some, but not all, of those processes, would have unusual Statuses
that Geoff seemed to think indicated a sendmail problem.

As I've said before, there's no reason in principle why we couldn't
have adopted or developed a convention that Players *could* change
Nomic Properties by declaration in the Public Forum. Other Nomics
appear to have done so. But as it happens, we did not, and our
decision not to do so is in many ways both indicative of and
responsible for the conservative or 'sensible' character of Agora
relative to those other Nomics, where play tends to be a bit wilder
and a bit more incoherent.

Oh, great. But it's not much of an argument for going back to procmail.
The problem I had with procmail was that its locking was inadequate :)

Erk. Consider, in that light, your definition below:

In the first place, it now looks as though we're going to need a
Rule which explicitly states that no Player is responsible for
recording the existence of all living or dead persons, which
seems a bizarre requirement. And in the second place, if for
some reason we don't get such a Rule, it looks as though the
Rules now require the destruction of those persons, even the
dead ones, whatever that amounts to, which is worse than merely
bizarre.

What do you mean "only physically impossible"? That's a pretty strong
variety of impossibility! But of course cheating of that kind is *not*
physically impossible, just very difficult, as you admit. Perhaps I've
gotten so used to the technical refinement of this concept in analytical
philosophy (to mean something like 'consistent with the laws of physics')
that I've forgotten that it probably still has a broader lay usage
according to which it means merely 'very difficult in practice'.

I see your point. Just because hacking files *is* so difficult, you
want to examine other possible analogues to this kind of creative
play in ftf games (and stealing VTs in an ftf Nomic game where this
is not otherwise prohibited is creative play, or what you call
"cheating" - in quotes - but it is not cheating - without quotes).

Sympathy from this quarter. But how to achieve it? A suggestion,
probably already being elaborated by others: first, switch to a
convention under which Players can, in general, alter Nomic 
Properties by posting to the Public Forum that they are doing so,
but secondly, list exceptions to the general case by enumeration,
not by abstract principle. By nature, abstract principles like those
expressed in R1011 tend to be all-encompassing and so block potential
avenues for creativity.

These are all questions of game design, not metaphysics, naturally.

Hope you've got a clear definition of each Class's membership coming up.

Ambiguous.  Suppose a NP's value is (x,y) and then it comes to pass that
only (x) and (y) are possible values?

"Unless otherwise specified, '<possible value of a NP> <name of a Class
of NEs>' shall be unambiguous shorthand for 'all members of <Class> for
which <NP>'s value is <value>', but only if that NP has a finite number
of possible values."

And possibly some NPs along the lines of Currency-Limbo-Holdings.

What if the NE is also defined in its own right?

I was about to complain "No more Adjacency by Proposal?" till I saw this.

I suppose this could be interpreted as "If something says the NE has a NP,
but nothing defines its initial value, then it's undefined; whereas if
nothing says the NE has a NP, then the NE doesn't have the NP at all",
which IMO is how it should work..

greater than or equal to that Rule's Power says so."

It's not just because it's Lisp that makes the difference.  It would be a
variant of Lisp, that allows the program to self-modify.  Standard Lisp,
and Perl, and in fact all high-level languages, do not allow arbitrary
self-modification.

Pretty much.  It's just the same as any other Nomic in that respect.

It's pretty easy to get something that looks damn like arbitrary
self-modification in Perl.  All one need do upon desiring to change
the program is to exec(*) the perl evaluator on the new source code.  Of
course it would be up to the "proposal mechanism" to ensure that this
new piece of code retained the ability to do the same, or else we
would have adopted a proposal that made all rule-changes impossible.
No doubt much the same sort of thing would be possible in Lisp.

Alternatively, you define a very minimalist core system that provides
immutable functionality, and then build everything on top of that,
including self-modification at the level above the core.  This may
seem to be an unfortunate concession, but let's face it, Agora
currently makes other certain seemingly immutable assumptions too:
that all of its Players can understand English, that we all have the
ability to communicate, think etc.

Michael.
(*) exec replaces the currently running image with another program.
    No state within the program is retained, so such an implementation
    would have to keep much of its "transient" state in files or lose
    it.

What happens to players who are in a location that is destroyed this

The automatic move to the origin is already there in the Rules.

Slightly bizarre, perhaps.  And I do include such a sentence
in my examples section.

Well, I did state that a NE destroyed ceases to exist for the
purposes of the game.  But perhaps it wasn't clear that I
meant for that to be the definition of destroyed, rather than
merely a corollary to being destroyed.  I'll see if I
can't clear that up.

Well, you could write a program which reads itself, makes modifications,
writes itself, and then recompiles fairly easily. But you still have a
compiler (or interpreter) (and operating system) in there somewhere.

That's what I did with PerlNomic. The core system has two main functions:
running the rules script, and providing certain abilities to the rules
script in a safe manner (reading and sending email, reading and writing 
data, and so on).

Well, Chuck did already include that in his draft.

Destruction, in Chuck's draft, means "becomes irrelevant to Agora," pretty
much. No actual destruction is neccesary.

Personal preference - I'd rather see the use of the word "destroy" avoided. 
I'd rather not see common words given special definitions that only apply in
Agora (or worse, in limited contexts within Agora).

In a few cases I do (Persons, Nomics).  In most I don't--why

But then the argument can be made "it still exists, it's just
not a NE" which is what I am trying to avoid.  Perhaps if I
made it clearer that ceasing to exist, for the purposes of the
game, is the definition of being destroyed rather than just a
corollary thereof?

No.  When would we want a Class of NEs to also be an NE?

Yep, I realized that when I wrote it (the special case of sets
here was one of the last parts I added) but I didn't have
a good solution at the time.  My main reason for making a special
case out of sets was something like this: the Jurisdiction of
an Organization is a NP, which has as its possible values
all subsets of the set of all Players.  So perhaps the
Jurisdiction of an Organization is Chuck, Steve, Morendil,
and Harlequin.  But if Harlequin ceases to be a Player,
that set is no longer a possible value for the NP of
Jurisdiction--but the default should be simply to set it
to be Chuck, Steve, and Morendil, rather than to have it
suddenly become undefined.

How about something like "...unless the possible values of the
NP are defined as sets, in which case the NP is changed by
removing those members of the set which are not members of any
possible value of the NP; then, if the value of the NP
is still not a possible value, it is undefined."  That
would at least cover the case I outlined above, while
causing your example to be undefined.  (Which is probably
as it should be, for we have no reason to pick X over Y,
or vice versa.)

You know, when I first read this question, I thought I had
an answer, but after thinking about it I'm not so sure.
The strongest objection I can come up with right now
is that I don't want NPs to go undefined as the normal
manner of things; they should be undefined only for short
periods.  But perhaps that's just an aesthetic objection.
I'll think about it some more.

Well, "Line of Text" only has a finite (but very large) number 
of possible values, since it is limited to 60 characters, and
Name and Title are Lines of Text.  So by your definition "Reported
Proposal" would refer not only to Proposals which have as their
P-Status Reported (which was my intention), but also those which
have as their Title "Reported".  Still, I recognize that the
wording in my version is poor, and perhaps something similar
to your version can be used.  (I suppose it could be argued that
the value Reported is not the same as the string "Reported",
but even so, it would be confusing at best.)

Probably so--I haven't delved too deeply into the Currency
Rules.

I think it probably should still be destroyed, although
I should write a clause to handle such a case explicitly.

Um, I see three wordings there (one in the actual definition,

Hmm, I'm not one to avoid double negatives, am I? :)

That was my intention; I'll see if I can clarify it.

Still doesn't sound quite right, although I do like it

Good point.  Also, I forgot to add that delegated Offices will
need another NP, Delegator (a Player).

General agreement on those comments which were deleted.

Fair enough.  I'll check the thesaurus later and see if I can't come
up with something less common. :)  If any one else has any suggestions

How about 'removed from play'? Not one word, but fairly accurate. It
manages to apply to animate, inanimate, real, and hypothetical entities at
the same time, too :-)

Hey, maybe Scott has some nice legal terms for "brought into the jurisdiction

Those are the legal terms of art that would be applicable, along
possibly with "made subject to the jurisdiction of ...".  "Added to
play" and "removed from play" are perfectly reasonable terms, however.

I think a better way of dealing with this particular problem is to
recognize that jurisdiction is a derived property, thereby vitiating
the need to discuss how it changes altogether (see my previous post on
intrinsic and derived properties).  If the jurisdiction of an
organization is recognized as merely the collection of all those
entities which have the intrinsic property of being subject to that
organization's jurisdiction, then no concern need be spent on changing
the derived property because it changes automatically when any entity
gains or loses the property of being subject to that organization's
jurisdiction.  (I realize that "jurisdiction" is used in an apparently
circular fashion above, but I believe that on examination it will
become apparent that that is not the case.)

I _really_ dislike the use of overly mathematical concepts such as
sets.  I think doing so encourages excessive nitpickiness.

What do you mean "only physically impossible"?

I mean something like your "lay usage": So difficult that noone will
ever really try it (in the context of a Nomic game - of course, with
(even ;) stronger incentives, like money, it will be tried). And
"only" because the physical difficulty of doing it without being seen

Evidence and arguments: See my message of 30.07.97 to the public
forum (attached).

Relevant rules: 116, 1011, 1576. (And, in principle, the other rules
pertaining to the creation of currencies, their properties and the
mintor's and recordkeepor's duties and abilities.)

P.S. Just for the record: I wouldn't be surprised to see this
dismissed as false based on game custom, but I'd like to try anyway.
(Or is it unwise to state such things in a message that contains a
CFJ?) 

P.P.S. I still like the names - to a German (born 1969) they are
pretty exotic, as is the idea of a currency where various
denominations are not related by factors of 100 ;)

----Att. 1: Message of 12.07.97 to the public forum (from Morendil)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

H. Chancellor,

I hereby announce and effect, on behalf of the Misanthropist's Group, the
creation of three Currencies, with the following characteristics, as per
the provisions of Rule 1722 :

Name: Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Payment Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Transfer Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1


----Att. 2: Message of 30.07.97 to the public forum (from Kolja A.)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

I hereby rename the currencies created by Morendil on behalf of the
Misanthropist's Group in a message of 12.07.97 to the public forum as
follows:

Old name                         New name
---------------------------------------------------------
Orders                           MMM-pounds
Payment Orders                   MMM-shillings
Transfer Orders                  MMM-pence

Remark

"Wait, you can't do that! These names are a Nomic Property (NP) of
these currencies and protected by 1011!"

No, they are not. What _is_ an NP is the fact that they do have a
name, i.e. are not nameless. This is explicitly required in 1576, and
not changed by changing the names.

But the particular names were given in a message to the public forum
(unlike the names of rule-defined currencies like VTs, which are given
in the relevant rules). So they are not Nomic Properties, after all,
and not protected by 1011.

Kolja A.

In other words, you would prefer to have a Boolean Nomic
Property of <Organization>-Membership for each Organization,
and assigned to each Player?  That would work, too.  Comments?
Preferences for one or the other?

Yes.  It is often easier to answer the question "Is John a Member of
the Peanut Butter Lovers Club" than to answer the question "Who are
(all) the members of the Peanut Butter Lovers Club"?  Furthermore, it
is often possible to resolve a dispute by answering only the first.
