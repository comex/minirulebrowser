I don't see the point.  I think the current consensus to the effect
that we can do nothing with Entities created by the General Will &c
except those actions explicitly permitted by the rules is a fine
situation to be in.  

I would vote against any change along these lines.

I worry about this last statement, which doesn't seem to follow from
the statement in the first paragraph, with which I think I agree. My
worry comes from thinking (again) about Monopoly. It certainly seems
true that the Rules of Monopoly are constrained to creating obligations
on Monopoly players and defining legal structures which establish what
those obligations are. 

But can the Rules grant existence to entities of any sort? That
depends on what you mean by 'grant existence'. Consider the Bank in
Monopoly, or the board on which the game is played. There's a
straightforward sense, of course, in which the Rules don't grant
these entities existence: the plastic tray in which Monopoly money
is stored and the cardboard square on which the Monopoly board is
printed are both manufactured by Parker Bros., not granted existence
by the Rules. But if that is the sense in which the Rules do not
grant these entities existence, then it is hard to make sense of
the remark which follows that claim, ie that 'this power inheres
in Players'. The Players don't grant the Bank or the board existence
in this sense any more than the Rules of Monopoly do.

So, perhaps something else is meant by 'grant existence'? Perhaps
it means 'grant legal significance to'. This reading results in
an interesting question getting asked: is it the Rules or the players
of Monopoly who grant legal significance to the Bank and the board?
My question to Scott: is this is an acceptable reading of your
remarks above and if so, can we take you to be claiming that in
fact it is the players and not the Rules which grant the Bank
what legal significance it has in Monopoly?

This is the last one I could find. I think it's the last one period, but
I'm not sure about that.

FYI, Zefram, I am treating this as an implicitly delayed Transfer Order for 2
Indulgences from you to the Bank.  You actually have 4 Indulgences due you from
the Bank, which will automatically trigger the delayed TO once the Chancellor
gets off eir duff and issues the TOs required to actually distribute the
Indulgences from the weekly lotteries.

This gives me an idea.  What do people think about allowing a Recordkeepor to
automatically vacate offsetting Payment Orders?  Like in this case, I have two
POs for 2 Indulgences each from the Bank to Zefram and one PO for 2 Indulgences
from Zefram to the Bank.  It seems reasonable that I, as Herald, should be able
to vacate the offsetting POs, leaving the one PO for 2 Indulgences from the
Bank to Zefram, as should be the case now.

I actually did not issue them, because of the yoyo problem.  It
appears that everything has stabilized, and I plan on bringing
everything back up to speed this evening.

I think we need some way to deal with problems like this.  As it is,
our timing rules are far too inflexible.

BTW, is everyone subscribed to agora@win.tue.nl now?

The main problem with this is dealing with disputed orders.  AFAIK,
you cannot dispute a vacated PO; so vacating offsetting POs would
deprive a payee of the right to dispute either PO.

There's also the problem of partial offsets and how to best deal with
them.  The legislation would have to be quite complex to deal with all
the cases effectively.  I didn't want to write it at the time I
drafted the PC reform.

Using the Without Objection mechanism to announce an intention to vacate the
POs should work here, I think.

Yup, that could get messy.  The best way to deal with it may be to not allow
it, although it might not be too bad to give Recordkeepors the discretion to
consolidate or break up POs for a given Currency that were issued on the same
day with the same payor and payee.

I do not wish to treat agora@win.tue.nl as a Public Forum until then,
even if the Distributor has duly declared it to be one.  (Perhaps the

The Currencies themselves, no, but the individual MUQs were destroyed, I
thought. These destructions are separate provisions in Rule 1579:


Rule 1579/3 (Power=1)
Mintors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.  All Players have Mint Authority.


Was there an argument to the effect that units were not destroyed either?

For the moment I will assume that I have VTs, but I am not sure.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I think a better option would be to have a new status for POs,
"offsetted", which is similar to vacated, but which allows them to be
disputed; if an offsetted PO is disputed or vacated, the corresponding
PO is "unoffsetted" and must be satisfied as if it had never been
offsetted.

This should not be too terribly hard to legislate.

This I might tolerate.  In fact, I have at times considered whether it
would be best to do some sort of granulization of time generally.  For
POs, it is presently safe, for timing purposes, to allow the
consolidations of POs made within the same Nomic Week.  

The main issue I have with consolidating POs is that, again, you lose
the right to dispute any of the POs which went into the construction
of the consolidated PO.  Similar problems exist with respect to the
breaking up of POs.  Again, creating a status (or statii) similar to
"offsetted" (as described above) should suffice to preserve
disputability.  Also, consolidating POs made within different Nomic
Weeks might modify liability for Persistent Indebtedness; the
definition of "overdue" would need to be modified and/or restrictions
established.

Simpler solution: only allow division, not consolidation.  Each of the
divided POs can be disputed on exactly the same terms as the original
PO.

The only useful reasons I see, at present, for this kind of manipulation is for
being able to offset corresponding sets of POs and to make it possible for a
Player to issue one blanket TO for a set of POs.  I don't think it's worth it
just for the sake of making recordkeeping more concise.  If we retain the
original information, then another (not quite as) simple solution would be to
have disputes allowed on the original PO, causing the consolidation or division
for the affected PO to be reversed.  This would slightly increase the
recordkeeping burden, but I think it might be worth it.  As Herald and
Promotor, it's a price I would be willing to pay.

I don't have access to the archives at the moment, but yes, I'm pretty sure the

(basically, IIRC, that only the Mintor or the owning Player can actually

By the way, it would be a good thing, I think, if Recordkeepors
numbered Payment Orders (and Transfer Orders) for simplicity of
reference.  That way you could mark a Payment Order as "Satisfied by
T/O 60123" or "Consolidated into P/O 1002" in the records.  I will
probably start doing this with either my next batch of reports, or the
one after that.

What a good idea.  Wish I had thought of it. 8)
I think I will prefix my numbers with a code that is unique to the Currency
type, like "I" for Indulgence and "P" for P-Note to avoid any possible
confusion if different Currencies end up with POs or TOs of the same number.

It looks to me like the Pragmatic Currencies need more abstract concepts
than the old system, for the same functionality.

My records confirm that this was the last Wizard's Report (it was posted
by General Chaos).

So would I. But I'm not sure I agree that the current consensus is
that we can do nothing with Entitites created by the General Will
except those actions explicitly permitted by the Rules. It rather
depends on how you interpret 'can' in that statement, and, as ever,
the important cases to consider are those of hacking files, and more
prosaically, making mistakes. If we mean 'legally can', then R1011
covers a lot, although not necessarily everything (it depends on what
gets counted as a Nomic Property). If we mean 'physically can', then
R1011 is irrelevant, since hacking and making mistakes is certainly
physically possible, even if it is illegal.
