Yes, I did. I think my mailer program (and apparently yours as well)
thought the rest of the message was a seperate message, and displayed
it as thus.

But it's 4 days in which you can't do much of anything, not just not move.
It might be regarded a loophole, but it is a very costly one in that case.

What with the current Pragmatic Currency crisis, plus the confusion of
the mailing lists, it's taking too much of my time to keep up with Agora 
at the moment. Having a thesis to work on, and a fair bit of other stuff
on my plate, I am forced to put my nomicking to one side for the time
being. Hence:

I hereby deregister from Agora Nomic.

I'm going to unsub from the yoyo list, but I would appreciate it if 
someone can contact many when new business & official lists are constructed,
as I would by keen to stay on these.

Seeya later...

Two worries:

1. Negative Entry Fees. Are these legal?
2. A pedant might argue that the Rule as amended makes it illegal
to enter a Contest which has no Entry Fee, or a zero Entry Fee.

Why, you sound skeptical, Jeff! :) And events may prove your skepticism
well-founded. But remember, No Trouble is No Fun!

I know, I know. That's why I haven't yet come right out and said that
I don't think that Locations exist. But there's still something that's 
bothering me about it, even though I can't yet say what it is. Every
time I sit down to try and compose an argument, I end up writing things
I don't agree with. So maybe my discomfort is baseless. I don't know
yet.

I think it was sent to the PF, but I suspect that it may have bounced
to me as administrator, perhaps because Vlad had not yet subscribed
to the yoyo list, or perhaps becuase there was some anomaly with his
address. At any rate, I didn't notice the bounce, and assumed that
everyone had seen it. I'm paying more careful attention to these
problems now.

The existence of the Court Room is established only indirectly by a
provision in P3475, implemented by R594. It is possible that this
exceeds R594's authority.

Oerjan was correct to reason that if the above argument is correct,
then no Locations other than the Origin exist, and you (and he, and all
of us) are already Located there. On the other hand, if that's true
then it's arguable that you never went On Hold, since that requires a
trip to the Stasis Chamber which you could not have made. Which you mean
you never ceased being Promotor, which would mean...

OFF: Promotor's Distribution

Per Harlequin's request, here is the early distribution of eir proposal.

There is one new proposal distributed as of this report, and there is one
proposal still in its voting period.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
 
D  3542 Swann     	1 Frankenstein Activism
D  3543 Harlequin   1 Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies

======================================================================

Proposal 3543 (Harlequin) (Disinterested) AI = 1
Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies

Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Amend Rule 1712  ("Distribution of Indulgences") to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players: for each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birthday."

Not in the least.  It clearly grants permission for a player to
purchase properties in particular circumstances.  In Monopoly, de jure
possession of a property is determined, for all intents and purposes,
by de facto possession of the corresponding deed, and other rules
(either stated or implied) dictate when it is permissible for a player
to take possession of the deed for a given property (and appropriate
recourse for the unlawful taking of such deeds).  Taking possession of
the deed for a property is a physical act, the possibility of which is
determined by the laws of nature.  

c647100> Not at all. The action by which the One produces the

This sounds _way_ too theological to have relevance here.

And here's the rub. You seem to be stating that game actions are impossible
unless specifically allowed by the Rules (which would render both R116 and
R1011 rather pointless, but that's another issue...) I am not sure why such
actions would be automatically impossible -- it seems to me that the
opposite would be true. Shoot, I had something else important to say here
but I've forgotten it... :(

But none of them do actually cause anything to happen until you report
them, correct? Adjustment of "abstract entities" aside, no "actual" change
to the game comes about until you share these changes with the other
players so that gameplay can be adjusted accordingly.

Although I have some sympathy with this position, my own is not so
hard line. I think it may possibly be useful to distinguish on the
one hand Players, mailing lists, and bodies of text, which all exist
independent of the Rules (although the Rules grant them some Nomic
Properties), from things like Locations, Currencies, and Kudos, which
which arguably exist only because the Rules say they do, and which I
characterize by the claim that all their properties are Nomic Properties.

Of course, this begs the question: useful for what? I admit I don't
have a really well worked out answer, but here's a hint: we might
want to institute different rules of evidence for determining the
status of Nomic Entities, since the state of Nomic Entities is tied
much more closely to the reporting of them in Official Documents.

Could all be pie in the sky, of course.

I suspect that that may be the position I am approaching. In that light,
I may come to regard our previous attempts to write Rules to prevent this
from happening (including my own: I was a contributor to the debate which
culiminated in the amendment of R1011 to roughly its current form; I 
remember the talk session in which Scott and I thrashed out the Nomic
Property concept) as unnecessary, and motivated by a poor
understanding of metaphysical issues. Although the Nomic Property concept
may have other uses.

COE admitted. The section above should read:


####
STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 6 and 12, which read: 

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.
####

and the Frankenstein Rule should read:

####
Rule 1671/37 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a 
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be 
      vacated.  

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

Of course not - but that's because there are also other rules which

Don't look at me. In my own philosophy, I try to avoid the Heideggerian
taste for obscurity.

As should be clear from my prior posts, I disagree with Harlequin
that I can, for example, place him On Hold by posting to the PF saying
"I hereby place Harlequin On Hold". Harlequin will say that this is
because being On Hold is a Nomic Property and hence by R1011 cannot
be changed except via procedures specifies by the Rules, of which
my making such a post to the PF is not one. But I don't think so:
even without R1011, I cannot see why we should think that my making
such a post has the effect of placing Harlequin On Hold, any more than
we should think that my announcing to the gathered Monopoly players,
"I hereby steal $100 from the Bank" actually has the effect of moving
a $100 bill from the Bank to me.

Harlequin, and perhaps Morendil, might want to respond that there's a
difference between stealing a $100 Monopoly bill and placing another
Player On Hold, namely, that the former requires some kind of
physical action for its achievement that the latter does not, perhaps
because being On Hold is being thought of as in some way an
'abstract' or 'purely logical' property. I think that's a mistake.
All game properties, in all games, whether played ftf or via email,
are equally abstract (however abstract we think that turns out to
be), because they share the feature of being granted significance by
the rules of whatever game is under discussion. All such features
will have to be physically recorded, even if only in the players'
heads (eg in a card game, the property of being the player whose turn
it is to deal). If the rules in certain game concerning some
particular property become at all complicated, increasing the
likelihood of the players disagreeing about it, it is inevitable that
some external physical representation will be used to keep track of
it. We could well imagine that a ftf game of Nomic (or Monopoly for
that matter) might employ the concept of being On Hold, in which case
it would almost certainly have to employ some means of marking a
player's possession of that property, perhaps by the wearing of a
coloured badge. In such a game, there is once again no reason to think
that I can place Harlequin On Hold just by announcing "I hereby place
Harlequin On Hold."

What I *could* do, which might be interesting, is to quietly take
one of the On Hold badges and stick it on Harlequin, then dance
around the room gleefully squealing "Look everybody! Harlequin's
On Hold! Harlequin's On Hold!". An intriguing debate might then
ensue about whether this action of mine has the effect I claim
it does. The outcome of this debate will be sensitive, among
other things, to the precise way in which the On Hold rule is
written. If the rule says: "A player places emself On Hold by
first announcing that they are doing so, and then by taking and
prominently displaying an On Hold badge." then I reckon my
action does not place Harlequin On Hold. On the other hand, if
the rule says: "Any player wearing an On Hold badge is On Hold."
then I reckon my action *does* place Harlequin On Hold. "A player
goes On Hold by wearing an On Hold badge." is somewhere between
these two examples and might plausibly be interpreted either way
by a Judge. (It's interesting in my opinion to think about the
pros and cons particularly of the first two ways of writing this
hypothetical On Hold rule. The first way is pretty resistant to
scamming, but it's hard to tell the difference between players
who really are On Hold and players who merely appear to be. The
second way avoids any such disputes, but at the risk of increasing
the opportunity for scams.)

But we're not playing an ftf game, and so we don't use coloured badges
or money, or other physical tokens which are easy to steal. We use
data stored in files for everything. This makes it enormously 
difficult to manipulate the physical representations if you don't
own the files. And if you do own the files? Then I claim, as above,
that the legal effect of manipulating those files is sensitive to
the precise ways in which the Rules are written.

I should think it's uncontroversial that some entities may be created by
Proposal.  _Rules_ are created by Proposal.

I am not.  I am stating that game actions are impossible unless there
is some manner in which they can be accomplished.  The Rules have
_nothing_ to do with this determination.  Rule 116 is not in the least
bit pointless; however, I do suspect that Rule 1011 is.

Nope.  The effect of casting a Vote takes place immediately; the
effect of the Vote is not contingent on it future report.  Same for
transferring VTs.  It is true that both of these actions instill an
obligation to eventually report on their occurence, but the occurence
of the event is not predicated on its subsequent report.  The only
thing that dictates whether the event occured is whether it was
physically possible for the event to have taken place.

This would only be true, in my opinion, if Agora were a "perfect
information" game.  Clearly, it is not.  The fact that I am forbidden

Steve has made a strong argument that such actions are possible, but
generally require hacking into people's computer files to accomplish
them.

This is the position I hold.  I believe that the entire problem arises
from a misapprehension of two things: the power of the Rules to effect
changes sue sponte, and the power of Players to effect changes "by
declaration".  In specific, I deny that either power exists.  The
Rules lack any physical agency through which they can accomplish
change, and Players are naturally limited in their ability to
accomplish change by the laws of nature.  I think the past
conceptualization operates in a fantasy, treating Players as the gods
of some abstract reality.  I once attempted to formalize this
conceptualization but was unable to explain how Players could be
ultrapowerful but yet also so limited, or how errors, especially
nonretractable error, could occur at all.  I now realize that the
problem was the paradigm itself, and not merely my efforts in
formalizing it.  The physicality paradigm that I now espouse suffers
from neither debility.  

Some will argue that there is no concept of the "correct state" of the
game in the physicality paradigm.  This is incorrect.  The "correct
state of the game" is the state it would be in were everyone to follow
the Rules, no more, no less.  Very simple.

Steve> Although the Nomic Property concept may have other uses.

Perhaps so; however, I think it would be best to come up with a
different name for the concept in its alternative use(s) so as to
avoid unintended conflation with the older, outmoded concept.

I believe that even this conceptualization needs to be reviewed.  How
does a Rule come to exist?  What, exactly, happens when a Proposal is
adopted?  What should happen?

I fear our present Rules are in a terribly confused state, largely
because we insist on overlegislating everything....

Just rewrite all the Rules in perl, I say!  That'll solve all these
uncertainties...

In my experience, most mail readers use the "From " line and not the

If there was no rule saying _how_ a player buys a property, I'm not sure
what I'd think (other than that the game has a poorly written rulebook
:-). I would expect a rule saying something like "A player can buy any
property..." (or perhaps "A player may buy any property...", which really
should read "can", but can be interpreted as "can" anyways).

Right. And in tournament situations, they rely on a judge. Unfortunately,
Agora most closely resembles a tournament situation (a single, very
important game which you can't just quit and start over) in which no
unbiased judges are available.

Am I right then in assuming that you have the same objection to creating named
entities by Player fiat (such as Currencies)?  What about individual
Organizations?

Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see the difference between the Rules
defining a procedure whereby Players can create new named entities and the
Rules defining a procedure whereby *proposals* can create new named entities. 
Granted, the current procedure for proposals doing this is probably inadequate
(i.e. a proposal does whatever it says it does).  Seems to me the solution is
not to prevent proposals from creating entities, but to restrict it in such a
way that information about such entities is adequately preserved for the life
of the entity after the proposal has been enacted.

No, I don't have the same objections to that. However, in a proposal, you
have the option of either creating a named entity, or creating a rule
which defines the named entity. I suppose entities of a general class
would be okay, but any named entity mentioned in the rules really should
be created by the rules.

// Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see the difference between the Rules

The primary difference is that in the case of a player creating an entity,
there is a rule which sepecifically grants them that power, so someone
browsing through the ruleset can see that they'll have to take entities
created that way into account. On the other hand, if you looked at the
ruleset, you might conclude that, since there is no procedure in place to
create new locations, the only location is the origin.

Procmail does not.  Convince your admins to replace your "local"
mailer with procmail if this is a problem.

(This is probably one the main reasons I never lose mail due to
procmail: procmail is my system's main mail delivery agent, rather
than being invoked from a .forward.  If my procmailrc is fucked up,
the mail ends up in /usr/spool/mail, rather than bouncing.)

No, I'm talking about the program you use to *read* the mail (Pine,
Netscape, Eudora, etc.), not the program which delivers mail etc. I use
procmail, and Pine splits messages on "From " line anyways. AFAIK, most
mail delivery programs use the content-length line, as they should.

I would prefer to have a stronger requirement for archiving of adopted
Proposals, requiring that the Archivist maintain a record of just
adopted Proposals, which I would prefer to call Acts, or perhaps
Statutes, which is easily referenced and, preferably, easily searched.
I would also give enrolled Act a very broad scope of authority to
require (or prohibit) things.

One of the problems in looking too closely at any conceptualization of
how Proposals become Rules is that you inherently run into the paradox
of self-amendment.

Oh dear. I know Steve uses procmail because of the time he had that
".forward" misprint.  But simultaneously, he uses elm which apparently
ignores Content-Length:.

There are two options to fix this:

>From looking at the elm help pages, there is a compile-time option in elm
to use Content-Length:. I guess if this is done system-wide one must
make sure to replace the standard mail delivery agent.

Alternatively, procmail can be told to not use Content-Length (escaping
"From " instead) by using the -Y option. This might be the easiest if
Steve cannot get the systemwide settings changed.

rjan.

On the other hand, if you really looked at the ruleset, you would see that
there is a thing called a Cartographor's Report, and you might conclude that
you had better look at the latest one to see what locations exist.  It's not
that much different from the Currency type of entity.  There may be a Rule that
tells you the way they can be created, but there is still nothing in the Rules
that tell you exactly which ones *have* been created.

Actually, I'm sympathetic to the argument that every entity created should have
some rule(s) that define a procedure for its creation.  I'm just not convinced
that it is the only solution to the "information problem", nor do I think that
it is sufficient.  I'm also sympathetic to the argument that it is wasteful to
have to spell out the definition of every named entity (like Locations) in the
Rules.

Organizations act through their Executors, who are Players.  Players
possess agency, which is (in my opinion) one of the most important
defining characteristics of a Player (or at least of a person).
Proposals, whether adopted or not, do not have agency, which is to say
that they have no way of actually doing something on their own.  The
only way that the Rules accomplish anything is through Players acting
in manners directed by the Rules.  I tend to think of Proposals as
reflecting the expressed will of the collective entity called Agora,
and the Rules as a means of recording the expressions of that will.

The real-world analogue (in the United State) is the United States
Statutes at Large, which contains the text of every Act of Congress
signed into law (as well as various other things, and the United
States Code, which reports all the Acts of Congress signed into law
which are presently in effect in their present form as amended by
later Acts, and in an organization more suitable for general use.  In
the United States, the Statutes at Large are the authoritative
references as to what the law says.  In short, it is adopted
Proposals, and not Rules, that have primacy (1 USC 112), but in
practice references to federal law are almost always made by reference
to their title and section in the United States Code.

Again, in my opinion, the ability to create entities is a consequence
of agency; thus, only Player can create entities.  The Rules do not
_define_ the manner in which Players create entities; rather, they
_direct_ Players to create entities (and may further specify the
manner in which Players so directly are to go about doing so); or,
alternatively, specify rules by which entities created by Players on
their own initiative are to be apprehended by the Rules.  The former
arises from the power of the Rules to constrain Player action, and the
latter from the power of the Rules to establish rules of
construction.  

David> Seems to me the solution is not to prevent proposals from

That can be accomplished by preserving the text of Proposals, but this
is already done anyway, as part of the Archivist's general duty to
preserve everything.

I disagree.  It makes no difference whether the entity is created

Again, I think this really serves to illustrate the ill wisdom in
allowing for the creation of entities without requiring the maintenace
of any record of their existence.  For Currencies, the Chancellor is
required to maintain a schedule of Currencies; a Player can ascertain
what Currencies exist by examining this schedule.  For Locations, the
Rules should state that the Cartographer shall maintain a schedule of
Locations, such that a Player might ascertain what Locations exist by
examining this schedule.  Add a legal presumption of validity to such
official schedules and you're all set.

Oooh! I love it when you talk Latin.  8)

I agree with you that the Rules lack any physical agency, but I think the
disagreement here then revolves around the concept of what constitutes
"change".  For instance, suppose we had a rule which defined a kind of Turing
machine program that each day deterministically "printed out" a symbol and that
other Player actions had different effects depending on the symbol of the day. 
There are two ways to look at this.  Either the game state "changes" every day
based on the "output" of the Turing program, or the Turing program just defines
a complicated formula that must be used in determining the effects of other
actions.  True, there is some element of fantasy to the first viewpoint, but I
think which one you use is more a matter of taste than a question of which one
is right or wrong.

I would not be one to argue thusly.  8)  And I like your compcept of the

It sounds from your description that the Symbol of the Day would be
constructible by the straightforward and deterministic application of
law to fact, where the (sole) fact in question is the date.  Since the
fact involved is not a fact that is reasonably subject to doubt, I
would only object in practice if the construction required was
complex, tedious, or difficult to replicate reliably.  But I would
generally not hold that the Symbol of the Day is an element of the
game state, since its value is wholly and directly dependent on
nothing more than the date, something that no Player can possibly hope
to affect.

Thank you.  One of the major perceived problems of the Pragmatic
viewpoint is that it appears to lack any appreciation of errors.  I
submit that the Pragmatic viewpoint does admit errors, and that there
is a straightforward way of defining what the "proper" state of the
game is, and even how to return to it when the state is found to be
out of whack with it.

In the case of Locations, that's true. However, if any Locations were
directly created by the rules (more than one or two), a person reading the
ruleset very well might conclude that the Cartographor's Report is
superfluous (although they would be wrong).

  I think the fundamental difference is how one approaches Nomic.
If Nomic is a game, then it is reasonable to think it is like most games
in that the Rules completely define all possible activity. For example,
in Advanced Squad Leader, the introduction advises: "Concentrate on what
the rules allow, not on what they don't specifically prohibit."
  However, if Nomic is a society, at least to the extent that it
formalizes interactions between the Players, then one might assume that,
as in real society, anything not illegal is ok. Your reference to a FTF
Nomic is apt, as I think Rule 116 was designed with just such an
interaction in mind.

  But the fundamental question is, where are the real VT's, say? If
they are on your computer, then yes, the only way to change them is
to access that computer. But I think you'll admit that that isn't a
realistic attitude. For example, if your computer exploded, that
wouldn't affect the status of VT's. In other words, the files on
your computer are only representations of VT's. Accessing your computer
is irrelevant to changing them.
  But are VT's completely Platonic? If so, then if your computer
exploded and there was no other record of them, we'd be up the
creek without a paddle. Same thing as if I did hack into your
computer and changed them. Either action may have no *legal*
effect, but it would certainly affect play. What position would
we take then? That the game state is not correct, and that it
has no reasonable chance of ever being correct? That is absurd.
And even an proposal that solemnly declared "The current game
state shall be correct" in such a situation would, I feel, be
meaningless, since the real game state would be in those
nebulous VT's. It might be possible to craft a Proposal to move
around those *real* VT's to conform to the current state, or
to eliminate them entirely, but this would be like the tail wagging
the dog.
  What then? Since VT's exist, insofar as they do exist, by an act
of the general will, if I then attempt to grant myself some VT's,
its success depends entirely on the general will. If the general
will assents, I have the VT, Rules or no, and vice versa. Ideally,
of course, the Rules reflect the general will in a form that can
easily be checked, and used to force those whose private wills
disagree to conform. 
   So the question is, in the absence of Rules (e.g. a statement of
the general will), can a Player exercise his private will to
affect an object created by the general will (A Nomic Entity)?
Rules 116 and 1011 seem to preserve two different expressions of the
general will on this topic. Thus one should be changed to conform
to the other, or both replaced with a new formulation.
  Since we all contribute to the general will, here is my opinion.
I prefer a laissez-faire system. Entities too important to leave
unregulated can be protected by giving them a common status
(such as Protected Entity) and then describing the limits to 
manipulating such Entities in a single Rule. I would prefer, 
however, to avoid a blanket definition as to what is protected and
what is not. Let the Rule defining each Entity do that.

Well, yes, I agree with you about that, too - but that's an aesthetic
objection. Just because it's ugly, that doesn't mean it's illegal.

In which case, there's no problem with the way Locations were created,
since the Cartographor is charged with keeping track of them.

Yes, but why is that a problem? The paradox of self-amendment is a
logical paradox, to be sure, but the law trundles on regardless.

I stopped using procmail because it developed the unpleasant habit
of crashing the machine where my account is located. I now use filter,
which is much simpler.

I got a couple of permanently fatal errors from <eljefe@easynet.co.uk>
this morning. Is there some problem with that address?

I agree with all this, apart from the implied assumption that Nomic,
or Agora, must either be a game or a society. I think it's both.
In particular, I think it's a game in which the sphere of defined
activities has especially and deliberately blurred boundaries.

"Where are the real VTs?" you ask. A seductively misleading question.
VTs are real enough - but so are interest rates and Beethoven's 
Pastorale Symphony. Where are *they* located?

I get the impression that by saying that such an action would
have no *legal* effect, you are trying to say that it would have
no effect on the Platonic state of the game. But what might you
mean by this? You cannot mean that it would have no effect on
the *actual* state of the game, for you admit that it would affect
play. So the actual and Platonic states of the game are not to
be identified. What such an illegal, but physically possible, action
*wouldn't* affect would be the *correct* state of the game, but as
experience has shown us again and again, we're only interested in
the correct state of the game up to a certain point and no further.

Why is it absurd? If by "correct" you mean, "the state the game
would be in if all the Rules were followed all the time", then
I think it is true that the game state we actually play with 
has no reasonable chance of ever being correct. But what follows
from this? Only that, as I said above, beyond a certain point
we are more interested in the game state we are actually playing
with (regardless of the legality or illegality of the processes
by which it was arrived at), than we are in the "correct" game state.

I don't consider Rules 116 and 1011 to be in conflict, but perhaps
that is not what you were claiming. I have stated before my view that
R1011 has stolen much of R116's thunder by prohibiting much of what
R116 would otherwise permit. But that was before the current discussion.

Yesterday I seemed to be coming around to the view that R1011 is
pointless. But now I'm not so sure. Consider the question: is it
legal for Harlequin to hack into Scott's computer and change some
voting messages? Without R1011, I'd say the answer is certainly
'yes': hacking is neither prohibited nor regulated, so it's legally
permitted. But, if we think that a Player's vote on a Proposal is a
Nomic Property, and if we think that by changing the voting message,
Harlequin succeeds in changing the vote, then what Harlequin does is
illegal by R1011, since what he's doing is changing a Nomic Property
via procedures not specified in the Rules.  

There are, however, problems with the above argument for efficacy of
R1011. Both premises are open to doubt. Is a Player's vote on a
Proposal a Nomic Property? If we identify the vote with the message,
then the content of the message is not a Nomic Property, since it has
that content regardless of what the Rules say. So changing it does
not violate R1011. On the other hand, in a debate with Morendil last
week, I defended a position with respect to Wills that would seem to
imply here that a Player's vote cannot be changed by changing by
changing eir voting message. That's to argue that changing a Player's
vote is not physically possible at all, given the way the Rules about
voting are written, in which case R1011 does no work, and turns out to
be pointless after all. Whether one ought to be comfortable with such
a view is not entirely clear to me yet.

I'm not convinced of the coherence of the suggestion. Which entities
are sufficiently unimportant to be left unregulated? And what would
that amount to - that you *could* change such entities by declaring
in the PF that you were doing so?
