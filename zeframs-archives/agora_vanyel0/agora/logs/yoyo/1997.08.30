			  Diplomatic Report
======================================================================

Rishonomic has been dissolved by the mutual consent of its Players.  A
new Nomic (New Rishonomic) appears to be forming.  I am treating New
Rishonomic as distinct from Rishonomic.

Ackanomic has apparently suffered a coup and is being ruled
despotically by a small group of players.  While intriguing, I do not
believe that this has any serious diplomatic repercussions.

A new Internomic Proposal has been made; its text is appended.  A
Referendum begins as of this message and ends Tuesday, September 2 at
22:46:48 UTC, so vote quickly.

======================================================================

Friendliness Report:

Friendly: Agora, FRC, InterNomic
Hostile:  none

======================================================================

Internomic Proposal 346 (Ackanomic):

Title: Inviting IN intervention.

[Acka has suffered a despotic coup.  This proposal is an invitation
to the internomic community to help restore democracy to Acka.]

Create a new rule reading:
All terms in this Rule should be interpreted according to Ackanomic law.
The players who comprised the Organization known as Vulcan as of August
25, 1997 are considered Internomic Fugitives.  They are forbidden from
altering the Ackanomic game state in any way whatsoever.

This Rule becomes a part of the Acka rulset, with a number one lower
than the lowest existing rule number.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended by appending the
following paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any Voting Tokens, the Assessor shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens to
      that Player.

(There's presently no provision for getting any VTs to new Players,
and forcing them to trade a P-Note for some VTs is a bit mean.)

Ackanomic has apparently suffered a coup and is being ruled

Do you know a little more about what heppened there? From a short look
at the material available on Acka's Webpage it appears that a new way
of making changes was introduced (Senatorial Proposals), by which a
small group of senators can change the rules. Then a group called
Vulcan somehow bended these rules to give them instead of the senate
this right. So: Are the Vulcan members senators, or what? Then I
assume the Internomic proposal was submitted by non-Vulcan members,
right? 

The Ambassador, in reply to Oerkan:
>>
Orjan> When considering this InP you will probably want to know that

[snip]

However, it might be argued that this creates an obligation on the
part of Ackanomic, as a Member Nomic, to change its Rules accordingly,
an argument that I think has merit.
<<

Which Internomic rule would create this obligation for Acka to change
eir rules according to this IN proposal? I think it might be a fun way
to help em out and to test new ways of using inter-nomic diplomacy; on
the other hand I strongly doubt whether it would work that way -
stating that Ackanomic's rules are changed by the acceptance of an
Internomic proposal is a bit like trying to do things within Agora by
posting to the PF: well meant but not working. So the proposl may be a
bit of empty words, only.

I would also be very cautious of setting such a precedent, for that
matter - it might quickly turn internomic into a platform where
inter-nomic wars are fought rather than ended.

So should we propose a change of IN rule 215 to remove Rishonomic from
the list of voting members? With Internomic and Rishonomic unable to
vote, getting proposals through will become pretty hard, I guess.

I'm not making this proposal now, but I will, if the H. Ambassador (or
others, of course) don't say anything against it.

Internomic Rule 101 requires all Member Nomics to abide by
Internomic's Rules.  It is very much an open question what that means.

I would instead suggest an Internomic SFJ on the question of whether
Rishonomic and New Rishonomic are the same Nomic.  Of course, Fate
would probably assign the SFJ to Rishonomic.

<<

If New Rishonomic already exists, that makes sense. However, if the
judgement turns out to be against the identity, 215 will still need to
be changed in an extra proposal, as there are no injunctions in
InterNomic, right?

Does New Rishonomic have a liaison yet (or any rules pertaining to
InterNomic at all)? Otherwise New Rishonomic, even if it is identical
with the old one in some sense, has not fulfilled the requirement of
IN rule 105. I'm not sure what that would imply, though: Rishonomic
ceasing to be a member (for failing to fulfil 105, and with 105 taking
precedence over 215), or nothing except that Rishonomic breaks a rule
until it has a liaison again, or what? 

Interesting question, and it is remarkable that such a situation was
not really in the initial (or the present) ruleset. There are no clear
sanctions for breaking rules, either, but I guess that is a feature
inherent in most Nomics, anyway.

I can see no compelling reason to disturb Judge Steve's ruling in this
matter.  In addition to Steve's arguments, with which I have no
substantial disagreement, I add the following:

Morendil notes in his argument that a change of Blots is the result of
the execution of a Payment Order in Indulgences.  If this is, in fact,
the case, then clearly someone is required to report a change of
Blots: the executor of each particular Payment Order in Indulgences.
Rule 1596/2 clearly requires Payment Orders to be posted to the Public
Forum, which in my mind effectively amounts to "reporting" the event.

It is my opinion that the original Judgement of FALSE be UPHELD.  

Entered this 30th day of August,

Justice General Chaos, Speaker
