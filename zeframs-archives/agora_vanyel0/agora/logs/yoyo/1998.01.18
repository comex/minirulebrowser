Hmm.  Gecko does seem to be broken.  I issued
P-Note payment orders for the two new Players and
have not seen them come back yet.  Below is a copy
of the payment orders sent to agora-business. 
These are not new POs but an attempt to get them
on record in case the originals got lost.

I hereby order the Bank to pay 5 P-Notes to Time
Agent.

I hereby order the Bank to pay 5 P-Notes to
Sherlock.
