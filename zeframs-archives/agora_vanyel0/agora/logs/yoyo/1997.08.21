Well, it's one week after all impediments to the execution of eir duties have
been removed, but I'm not opposed to making it longer.  Suggestions?

I think it's worth recalling at this point in the discussion that
Agora's parent-game, Nomic World, was implemented as a MUD, which
themselves have strong historical links to role-playing games. So
it's not surprising that the avatar view should be hanging around.

They are only because Agora fails to define "person", leaving it up to
"other standards".  I would argue that the "other standards" that

It would depend on the law of country X.  Few, if any, countries allow
for the formation of fictitious persons without the residency of at
least one of the principals, or, barring that, the payment of funds
and the filing of paperwork.

I think the problem here is that because the scope of the actions
which might pertain to a Nomic is unlimited, it is not possible to
make the separation you wish to make.  In chess it is easy to identify
those actions which are relevant to the game; in Nomic it is not,
especially since an action which at present appears irrelevant might
be made relevant later by a change in the Rules.

I have no objection in principle to such a system, and would weigh any
practical objection on the extent of legal discretion allowed the
recordkeeper, the extent of the avenues of legal recourse which may be
established, if any, and the potential for serious (legal) injury to
players as a result of borderline behavior by the recordkeeper in
question.

c647100> Would you say that such a system was contrary to the

Not in the least.  Nothing I can think of requires a Nomic to
absolutely regulate everything within its domain.  Even changing the
Rules could be relatively unregulated; for example, in Fascist the
Imperious Emperor can change the rules at whim.  Such deregulation
would be of minimal in a play-by-email game, as only the keeper of the
Rules would be in a situation to make use of it, but might be quite
fascinating in a tabletop game.

I do not understand the question here.

Of course.  The power of the Rules to compel derives from the fact
that the Rules are presumed to be the the codification of the
expressed will of the Players, and as such the Rules are dependent on
the (implied) Game Contract for their authority.  Ultimately, the
Rules depend on the Players for their very existence.  

I also tend to accept Suber's suggestion of an inherent right to
amend; the Players can, by unanimous consent, amend the Rules, the
Rules notwithstanding.  It's debatable whether this can be
accomplished by less than a unanimity; in part it depends on how vocal
and determined the minority is, and how sacrificiable the majority
apprehends the minority to be.

Your point is perfectly clear.  Unfortunately, I have been very unsuccessful in
making myself clear.  I am not, repeat not, talking about a player/person
distinction.  I am talking about an abstraction, which I called a "player
abstraction", that may best be described as "the set of all actions by a person
that are subject to the rules of the game". In Agora, as interpreted by you and
most other players, this is equal to "the set of all actions by a [registered]
person", which makes it possible for you, Scott and others to completely ignore
this abstraction and even deny that it exists in Agora.  But it does exist in
Agora because the Rules define a set of player actions over which the Rules
claim jurisdiction.  The set just happens to be the set of all actions, as
currently interpreted.

In most, if not all, other games, these two sets are not equivalent.  Myself,
and I expect most players first coming into Agora, are not expecting these two
sets to be equivalent.  There are "role playing" aspects to Agora that
facilitate a natural tendency on the part of the uninitiated to
anthropomorphize this "player abstraction" into the dreaded avatar.

BTW, it should not be necessary for something to exist in Agora in order for it
to be relevant to a discussion concerning Agora.  That restriction would make
for a rather dull and static game.  8)

I'm willing to accept that the nature of Nomic may cause some practical
problems in making a clear cut distinction between these two sets of actions.
Although in general, especially for e-mail games, I don't think it is as
difficult as some people think.  A perfectly reasonable and easily identifiable
set of governed actions in an e-mail based Nomic is "all communicative actions
between players + any action explicitly described within the rules".  I don't
see any theoretical problem in the fact that a game might allow the set of rule
governed actions to change during the course of play and I don't see this as
necessarily making it any harder to tell which actions are relevant to a Nomic
(at any given moment) than a game of chess.

The problems arise with "action explicitly described within the
rules."  Suppose I were to hire terrorists to blow up Morendil's
computer to keep him from voting on a Proposal.  Your definition would
hold that that action was not "part of playing Agora", because hiring
terrorists to blow up Morendil's computer is not a communicative
action between two players, nor is it something specifically mentioned
in the Rules.  But I would.  Contrariwise, Steve and I have chatted
(via talk) about the foibles of the Australian parliament, as well as
hundreds of other topics not ostensibly related to Agora.  Your
definition would hold that those actions are "part of playing Agora"
since they comprise communicative acts between players.  I would not.

I'm not even sure that this discussion constitutes "playing Agora".
It seems to me to be more a discussion about how we play Agora, and
belongs more properly to some level of metaplay, rather than to the
actual play itself.

I therefore submit that your definition captures things it should not,
and fails to capture things it should, and is therefore inadequate.
The failure to capture things that should be is, in my opinion, a more
serious flaw; thus, I consider the general conceptualization, which
captures every action of a Player, as more useful.

Wrong.  Commiting violence againt another person or their property *is* a
communicative act.

Your definition already includes this activity as part of playing Agora too. 
It would be easy to change it to "all communicative acts relating to Agora" but
then you might introduce ambiguities regarding which communications actually
relate to Agora.

Fascinating.  This is precisely the position I took during the last version of
this debate - that we are not "playing Agora" all the time.  You, Chuck and
Steve vigorously advocated otherwise and convinced me that the Rules had to be
interpreted such that we are "playing Agora" continuously.

I disagree.  You will have to come up with a better example of something that
is not captured which should be to convince me otherwise.

The supposed act was that of hiring terrorists to blow up Morendil's
computer.  In the hypothetical example, it is not supposed that I
personally blew up Morendil's computer.

That aside, if you take this stance, _every_ act is communicative, or
at least potentially is.

I argue that you are always subject to the Rules, even when you are
not ostensibly "playing Agora".

So any Rule that attempts to allow, or compel, an impossible action has,

You don't have to personally deliver a letter to Morendil in order to
communicate with em by writing either.  The terrorists you hired are merely the
"postmen" that have delivered your message.

Every act that transmits information from one party to another is
communicative.  There are plenty of actions that do no such thing.  Although
admittedly there are acts which do so in some contexts but not in others.  So
what?

I see.  I had not realized you made that distinction from the prior discussion.
I'm not sure I agree that it is a valid distinction, since I would consider any
action that is subject to the rules to be an action "in play".  Maybe it would
be better to say that the argument seems to me to have been that you are
"playing Agora" even when you are not ostensibly "playing Agora".  8)

What's wrong is, as I have said, your example is one of a communicative action.

Is this any better?

Revised 116:

   Any action not prohibited or regulated by the Rules is permissible,
although not necessarily possible, with the sole exception of changing the
Rules, which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
or implicitly permits it.
   Players may manipulate any other entity created by the General Will of
the Players by posting a description of the manipulation to the Public
Forum, PROVIDED the manipulation is not paradoxical and is not prohibited
or otherwise regulated by the Rules. Such manipulations include, but
are not necessarily limited to, creation, destruction, and changes in
ownership or other properties.
   Entities created by the Private Will of an individual Player are
also subject to this Rule, provided the Player who created them
gives express permission.
   In the case of a dispute as to the legality or effects of such
a manipulation, it is the sole responsibility of the interested
Player(s) to provide evidence of the nature and timing of the
manipulation. If such evidence cannot be produced, the manipulation
shall be disallowed.

I am not seeking to communicate with Morendil.  I am seeking to
prevent him from casting a vote by interfering with him ability to
communicate with others.  No particular message to Morendil is
intended by this action.

Would you still consider it an act of communication if I hired a
hacker to disable Morendil's email?

I think that at this point we are arguing terminology rather than
substance.

I disagree.

Doesn't this effectively subordinate the will of the many to the will
of the one?

Not at all. The Rules (the will of the many) take precedence. Only
in the absence of a Rule does the individual have power.
I have also been thinking about adding a clause allowing a Referendum
to withdraw the authority of the new 116 for specific actions, to reduce
the possibilty of catastrophic side effects.
