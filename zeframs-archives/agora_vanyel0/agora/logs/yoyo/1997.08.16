[Crito and Michael arguing over whether R1701 re-creates P-Notes as a
 Currency after R1579 destroys them]

So are P-Notes a Currency with an unspecified Mintor?  If so, is the
identity of their Mintor determinable?

It has been suggested that I take the backup list as my responsibility.
It has now been created, at the address agora@win.tue.nl. It is a majordomo
list, so one can send all the usual commands to majordomo@win.tue.nl.

This isn't a problem, since disputed POs are not subject to debt penalties.

Hmm.  I had thought that P-Notes were a Currency without a Mintor, not with an
interderminate one.  But this is another possible interpretation of "each
Currency shall have a Mintor" (although not one I expect the Courts to uphold
8).

Perhaps both 116 and 1011 ought to be rewritten? I've been playing
around with something like the following:

Revised 116:

   Any action not otherwise prohibited or regulated by the Rules is
permissible. If a Player wishes to perform such an action, he/she may do
so by posting a message describing the action to the Public Forum. 
If a formal dispute arises as to the legality or effect of the action, it
is the sole responsibility of any interested parties to produce a
record of the timing and nature of the action allegedly performed.
If such evidence cannot be produced, the action shall have no legal
effect, insofar as that is consistent with the other Rules.
   If an action is regulated by other Rules, those Rules have precedence
regarding by whom and under what circumstances an action may be taken.

I am opposed to those forms of silliness that render the game an

  Please explain. Surely you would allow that I can take the action
of wishing you a nice day merely by posting it? Or of challenging
you to a duel? And if certain game events were contingent on those
actions, that I could trigger them by doing so?
  Now let's extend the situation. Let us assume a particular commodity
is owned by various Players but there are no Rules that specifically
allow or disallow trading them. I don't see any problem, in principle, 
in allowing such trades in the absence of the Rules. It merely involves
the free desires of the Players. You may not wish them to have the
power, but that can be resolved by passing a Rule, not by summarily
restricting their freedom of action. Similarly, I think Players should
be allowed to make enforceable Contracts in the absence of a specific
Rule, or of forming legal Groups for that matter. Now of course there
can be restrictions and regulations, but such a situation is at least
hypothetically possible, and I think desirable.
  I mean no disrespect, but you seem preoccupied with what is
"physically possible", when we are dealing with abstract entities
that are subject to no natural law. Many games allow actions that
in real life would be impossibilities. I'm not sure that deriving
authority for such actions from a specific Rule(s) that lists specific
procedures under specific circumstances is any more implausible,
inane, or silly than deriving authority from a general Rule that
lists none of the above.
  Of course, I think one might have legitimate concerns about the
_practical_ effects of such a Rule, but I personally think that
suporting creativity and experimentation is worth some risk.

Certainly, but that is because those actions are naturally
communicative in nature, and thus emitting a communication is the act
inherent in performing them.

I do not contest the use of communicative acts as possible triggers

I have no problem with allowing the unrestricted trade of unregulated
commodities.  But I do have a problem with equating the expression of
the desire to trade commodities with the trade itself.  I can post,
until my fingers are raw from typing, that I am sending $5 to Chuck,
without ever causing Chuck to receive any money.  All I have done is
expressed a desire.  But a desire, no matter how fervently expressed,
remains only a desire until and unless it is actualized by some
concrete action.  We are not gods, or djinni; we cannot cause reality
to change merely by desiring it to do so.

This has nothing to do with "not wish[ing] them to have the power",
but merely recognizing that no such power exists.  The power you refer
to is a fantasy; it does not exist.  Your model devolves to
omnipotence for everyone, the power to actualize any wish, and is thus
clearly ridiculous.  And I submit that you will be unable to establish
suitable limits that avoid conflicts with physical reality and still
retain the abstractual power you wish to assert, or at least will not
be able to do so without creating a conceptual structure so complex as
to be unwieldy for the purpose of playing a game.  (Yes, I have tried.)

c647100> Similarly, I think Players should be allowed to make
c647100> enforceable Contracts in the absence of a specific Rule, or
c647100> of forming legal Groups for that matter.

Contracts, yes.  Enforceable, no.  There is no basis in the Game
Contract for such enforcement.  Again, Chuck and I could enter into a
contract of some sort.  Suppose I were to breach it.  Chuck could call
a CFJ on the question as to whether I had breached the contract, and
the CFJ might be judged TRUE.  But the Judgement places no compulsion
on me to abide by the breach clauses of the contract, or make
restitution for my breach, because no Rule requires me to abide by
the contract I enter into.

Of course, if Chuck were to prosecute the matter in the Monroe County
Circuit Court, or the Federal District Court for the District of
Southern Indiana, a compulsion could be created by a judgement of the
court.  But that is because both Indiana and American federal law
recognize the common law of contracts (as modified by the Uniform
Commercial Code, to which Indiana subscribes, and other pertinent
state and federal statues).  Agora does not.  Nor should it, since the
common law of contracts is somewhat variable from country to country,
and Agora's playership derives from at citizens of least seven
different countries.

c647100> I mean no disrespect, but you seem preoccupied with what is
c647100> "physically possible", when we are dealing with abstract
c647100> entities that are subject to no natural law. 

No, we are not; your statement indicates that you fail to understand
my position entirely.  I am not in the least bit concerned with
abstract entities, nor do I believe that we are at all dealing with
them.

c647100> Many games allow actions that in real life would be
c647100> impossibilities.

I believe you are being disingenious here.  What really happens is
that these games allow for actions which, by consensual agreement, are
considered to be symbolic of actions which are physically impossible.
The physically impossible actions remain impossible; the players
merely agree to pretend as though they had taken place anyway.  Some
games, especially role playing games, are entirely or nearly entirely
encapsulated by such consensually agreed-upon symbolisms.  I do not
believe that Agora is such a game, however.  Agora is firmly imbedded
in the real world, and I think it should stay there.

c647100> I'm not sure that deriving authority for such actions from a

The general Rule you suggest is contrary to natural law; it asserts
that Players can fly by declaring it, for example, when we know that
they cannot.

Aha ! That's interesting. Why shouldn't Agora become, for instance, a
role-playing game ? I haven't looked at any of them too closely, but many
Nomics currently in activity have themes that are at least reminiscent of such
an orientation. Isn't the Plots proto, which would have us become farmers, 
miners and whatnot strongly suggestive of that ? Your last remark that Agora 
should remain 'firmly embedded in the real world' is one possible orientation 
we might wish to give to the Game, and it might correspond pretty closely to 
the form in which we're currently playing it, but it's certainly not the only 
admissible one, and it's quite possible that Agora might evolve into pure 
'fantasy' at some time.

There are, without a doubt, _aspects_ of such fantastic constructions
even in Agora, and I have no problem with that.  The problem becomes
when you take the _entire_ game into such a fantastic construction; at
that point it ceases to be a Nomic.

I disagree.  I believe that being firmly embedded in the real world is
a necessary part of being a Nomic.

Hmm, I did not meant that literally - there's no reason that I can think of
why one couldn't imagine an RPG with Nomicness, or a Nomic constructed like an
RPG, though.

So where do you place the dividing line ? My own opinion is that it would be
perfectly possible, indeed quite enjoyable, to play a version of Agora in
which, say, Proposals were made by moving your 'character' to the Library to
acquire writing implements, sealing a parchment, then bringing it to the
Promotor, and so on. I don't even think it would be a problem to frame the
Rule Change and Proposal Rules themselves in terms of a fantastic
constructions, as long as the "social contract" or meta-rules or whatever you
want to call them made it clear that "Bringing a parchment to the Promotor" is
a metaphor for "sending a mail message to the person whose character is
currently the Promotor".

What sort of problems do you envision that would make it impossible to 
reconcile Nomicness with the essential aspects of a RPG ?

To all Players : would anyone be interested in playing a "Fantasy Nomic" ?

The Rules have to be changeable, and the Rules are in the real world;
if you completely push everything into a fantasy world, there's no way
to change the Rules.

I'm afraid I don't follow the inference. Fantasy worlds also have rules, don't
they ? (In fact entire fantasy novels are constructed on this premise, notably
Jack L. Chalker's delightful Dancing Gods saga, which I recommend.) In fact,
most RPGs have at their core rule books which regulate how purely abstract and 
communicative actions on the parts of the players "project" (are symbolic of, 
to use your own phrase) to make-believe 'events' in a fantasy world.

My contention is that it would be quite feasible to construct a fantasy world
in which the rules contained in such rule books would have a fantastic
counterpart in whatever world the game was set in; and to have those rules
contain provisions that allowed symbolic, make-believe 'events' in such a
fantasy world result in rule changes. (These 'events' would after all 
correspond to perfectly ordinary acts in the physical world, such as the 
throwing of dice or communicative exchanges between Players.)

To be sure, it would be possible, given the possibility of changing the Rules,
to modifiy the actual rules in such a manner that the symbolic rules would get
out of sync, or that it became impossible to modify one or the other set. But
then again, Agora could be mutated in a non-Nomic by similar processes; my
point is that I see no obstacle to establishing a one-to-one, bidirectional
relationship between fantasy rules and actual rules, such that it would be 
possible (with suitable 'suspension of disbelief') for players to pretend that 
the characters they manipulate were themselves changing the rules of their own 
world.

The challenge in such a game would be to frame the language of the rules in 
such a way that it would not shock the players out of that suspension of 
disbelief and be consistent with the fantasy setting used; a medieval fantasy 
for instance would have to avoid terms such as 'email' or 'print media'. But 
then again, this is only an issue of obtaining the appropriate consensus from 
players participating in the game, or, if you will, the appropriate meta-rules 
concerning the use of language.

Yes, exactly.  Those rules are generally immutable.  You could
construct a game within such a fantasy world, and, from the perception
of the Player's avatars, it would be a Nomic, but not from the
perceptions of the Players.

That aside, there will always be Rules that necessarily pertain to the
real-life Players.  It is my opinion that you cannot completely
disentangle the real world from a game of Nomic and retain its status
as a Nomic.

Here's where the immutability of the paradigm lies.

  Then I assume that if a currency were represented by RL slips of
paper, you would allow trades of such slips legal status. But
what if we didn't actually trade the actual slips, but only the
records of the transactions, whereupon the parties would undertake
to make/burn the appropriate number of slips? What if they dispensed
with slips entirely, but merely kept paper records? Or electronic
records? Or merely mental records? I see all these as plausible
and valid derivations of the original situation.

The only two real world constructs necessary to play are a person
to control the Player, and a forum for communication. I don't see
why both can't be protected quite easily although I admit I cannot
think of a situation where the lack of such protection would cause
any _practical_ problem to arise. DO you have any in mind?

I should think that such a contract would be no less and no more

Exactly what real world elements are involved, other than the two I

Yes it would allow that. I don't see how that would affect the game
in a practical sense. Perhaps we should put "the laws of nature"
ahead of the Rules, game custom, and the spirit of the game in the
list of factors judges must consider when judging a CFJ. :-)

Would the following assuage objections?

Revised 116:

   Any action not otherwise prohibited or regulated by the Rules and not
paradoxical or contrary to natural law is permissible. If a Player wishes to
perform such an action, he/she may do so by posting a message describing
the action to the Public Forum. If a formal dispute arises as to the
legality or effect of the action, it is the sole responsibility of any
interested parties to produce a record of the timing and nature of the
action allegedly performed. If such evidence cannot be produced, the
action shall have no legal effect, insofar as that is consistent with the
other Rules.
   If an action is regulated by other Rules, those Rules have precedence
