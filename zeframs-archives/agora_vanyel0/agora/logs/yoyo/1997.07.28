There's nothing expecially Platonic about this body of text. The Rules
happen to give legal significance to what you write in your Will, and
not to changes made by the Notary.

The old R1637/0 was clearer about this than the new R1637/1. R1637/0
stated that:

      A Will is created by sending to the Notary a collection of text
      clearly labeled as a Will, which shall then become that Player's
      Will...

Nevertheless, I think new R1637, along with other Rules remain sufficiently
clear to establish the point:

R1637/1:

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will. Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.

R1626:

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by its
      creator, provided that its creator is a Player.  Once created,
      an Application may not be changed, except by adding Signatures
      to it or striking Signatures from it.

R1627:

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to the creator of that Application indicating that e is
      signing that Application.

R1628:

      An Application is Executed when its creator sends it to the
      Officer or other Player specified in the Rules pertaining to
      that type of Application (or to the Public Forum), clearly
      indicating that e is Executing it at that time.  An Application
      cannot be Executed in any other way.


The Rules are very clear that Morendil's Signature must be added to
an Application to Create a Will in order to create Morendil's Will
(ie to give legal significance as a Will to a particular document).
If the Notary tampers with the Application, then you can argue that
you have never Signed that Application, and thus that it is not your
Will.

I think you'll find the Courts will maintain that 'deregister' means
'cease to be a Player'. Uses of 'deregistered Player' in the Rules,
eg in R1601, should I think be read as a convenient shorthand for
'formerly registered person'.

Well, I gave that reading of 'destruction of an Application'. But
which Rule is it that is calling for the destruction of Elde? 

Deregistration of a Player does not strip that person of all eir
Nomic Properties, as I think you appreciate. Eir Kudos are
retained, for instance (R1062). If e deregistered voluntarily, e
retains the Nomic Property of being prohibited from reregistering
before the beginning of the next month (R1043). E becomes a
terminal estate (R1601).

Deregistration does strip you of the Nomic Property of being a Player,
which, if you are a person, is a precondition of being a Voting Entity.
So I take it that your intriguing attempt to exercise your rights as
Elde's Executor by trying to vote on his behalf does not work, since
Elde, or perhaps I should say, Derek Lyons, no longer possesses the
Nomic Property of being a Voting Entity.

My reading of R1601 is that you have become the Executor, not of a
Player, but of a terminal estate associated with former Player Elde.
The locution used in R1601 ("A deregistered Player *is* a "terminal
estate"...") is admittedly an awkward one, and probably should be
rephrased. But I don't think it's a loophole big enough to climb
through.

The problem with this reasoning, I think, is that if you wish to bring R116
into the picture to "permit" the movement, you also have to bring in R1011,
which prohibits it. As I see it, R1708 is the only Rule which actually
flat-out states that Entities can Move.

Well, I've received one already. Actually, this gives me an idea for
a theory which might explain the rather bizarre way in which yoyo
sometimes behaves, and still seems to be behaving, which theory I will
submit to the mail-wizards amongst us (Scott, Vanyel, Oerjan, Chuck,
and others), so that they can laugh at me and mock my ignorance. I am
not claiming that this is how the majordomo software installed at
yoyo actually works. I don't know how it actually works. But if it
did work in something like this way, it might explain a few things. 

Here's the picture: yoyo has a list of subscribers. When it receives
a message, it goes down the list in order, sending it to each of them.
I hypothesize: what if there were some kind of error, say an 'over quota'
error or some such thing, which, when it occurred would cause majordomo
simply to stop and wait for it to be corrected before moving on down
the list? If that ever occurred, then no-one below that point on the
list would receive that message, at least until the error was
corrected, say by means of the list administrator removing the over
quota subscriber from the list. When that happened, all the
subscribers who had not been receiving messages would suddenly
receive a large glom of mail that had been queueing up to get to
them. That would certainly explain my experience this morning: I came
in after the weekend and found I had no new nomic mail since
Saturday, including mail from yoyo. I also had a number of different
complaints from majordomo@yoyo about messages not reaching various
subscribers for a variety of different reasons, mostly 'user
unknown's and 'over quota's. I removed these subscribers. Not long
after, I received the weekend's mail from yoyo, about 40 messages. It
would also explain why some people seem to have these problems and
not others: it would depend on where you were in the list.

Against this theory is my observation that Scott Goehring has
experienced no delivery problems from yoyo, despite being below me
(and you, Harlequin) on the list of subscribers Majordomo sends in
response to 'who' queries. But maybe that list is not the one that
Majordomo actually uses. Or maybe there's some other explanation.
Ah, the black art of listserver software...I'll shut up now.

If this interpretation is accepted, then arbitrary Movement was possible
even before R1708's infection, and will be possible after R1708's
disinfection.  Arguments for both sides?  Suggested fixes?

You must have missed some -- Morendil first noticed that the teleport lists
were down, and after a few comments were hurled about, Chuck found that the
teleport lists were indeed down.

It seems that, unless someone has a way to contact Coren other than his
teleport account, we've pretty much lost that opportunity.

Let me say, just for the record, that at the moment I have exactly zero
income available to devote to such an idea, and thus would have to say,
"no." :-/

Given what goes on regularly with Agora Money, I'd be afraid. :)

I think we had a bit of a glitch earlier this year as well, didn't we?
Anyway, the backup list has certainly been useful for those of us who had
trouble getting n-b and n-o to accept our posts. :)

Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Mon, 21 July 1997
Date of last Report: Mon, 14 July 1997

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 3 and 7, which read: 

      Any change to the game state which would result in this
      Frankenstein Monster becoming false is cancelled and does not
      take place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

I selected sentence 3 to be deleted.


STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1629, which reads:

####
Rule 1629/2 (Power=1)
Application Fraud

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Crime of Application
      Fraud, a Class D Crime.

####

I selected the sentence

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Crime of Application
      Fraud, a Class D Crime.

I selected the noun "Crime."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####
Rule 1671/36 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

I can't take credit for that - I think it was Scott or Chuck who first
noticed.

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I reject the idea that Transfer Orders referred to in Rule 1598 are
the same as the currency supposedly created by the Misanthropists.
That rule defines a TO as an "order" of a certain kind, namely a
directive to do something.  The Misanthropists' currency is a
different kind of object, and does not succeed in confusing the two
concepts. See also CFJ 803.

However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences from
the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by Rule
1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any Currency,
was not a Transfer Order.

Thus the Statement is true, although possibly not in the way the
Caller intended.

Postscript: I reject the idea that Indulgences continue to exist via a
precedence conflict with Rule 1454.  We've had currencies lacking a
Mintor cease to exist before this.

I don't think so. 1626 makes it illegal - IOW, a Rule violation - to
change a body of text under some circumstances. I contend that it cannot
make it impossible, nor would a Notary's violation of 1626 by changing
the text of an Application once it is submitted to em make such an
Application legally void.

Take, for instance, Players. They are for the purposes of this discussion
the same kind of entities as Applications - i.e. they primarily owe their
existence to factors other than the Rules, although various properties may
be attached to them. If I submit a Proposal and have a haircut during its
VP, I will still be "the same Player" as the Proposal's author and will
stand to earn the rewards (or be subject to the penalties) for that Proposal,
right ?

That would hold true even if we had a Rule stating "Once created, a Player
may not be changed except as permitted to by the Speaker". In that case,
my haircut would be illegal, but I submit that this Rule would no prevent
me from being identified as the Player I previously was.

You definitely missed out on some. :) One item that seems to be settled
already: we'll be adding OFF: DIS: and BUS: in the Subject: headers of
our messages (manually) to facilitate the task of mail processors. (Any
of the three identifies Agora mail; in addition, those who have separate
folders for each list can sort mail in the correct folders.)

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1435 goes : to gain or receive Blots is to be subject to a PO for
the same number of Indulgences, and a Player's Blots is the total
amount of such Transfers e has been ordered to effect (that are not
disputed or vacated). Thus a "change in Blots" is precisely the
executing, disputing or vacating (but unfortunately not the
satisfaction) of such a Payment Order.

Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report the
change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
particular Payment Orders.

A poor choice IMHO - there was clearly more potential for interesting

Well - that would be consistent with one way of interpreting Rule
869, in which "A person is a Player" becomes a shorthand for "A person
is assigned the Nomic Property of Playerhood".

I'm of the opinion that the current interpretative shift, toward letting
"An X is an Y when Z", where X has a definite existence outside of the
Rules, stand for "An Y is assigned the Nomic Property of X-ness when Z",
is not fully tenable given the language in 1011, 1586, et al. But let's
adopt that paradigm for this discussion - it has the merit of making some
things much clearer.

In that light, "A Player is a person who is registered" would be
interpreted as "A person who is registered is assigned the NP of
Playerhood". Note though that it becomes rather difficult to make
sense of Rule 1432 using that interpretation.

Continuing, it would seem to make sense to assume that a person who is
deregistered ceases to be registered. Your contention that such a person
ceases to be a Player, however, requires us to interpret "An X is an Y when
Z" as the stronger form, "An Y is assigned the Nomic Property X when it
becomes the case that Z, and this property is removed from Y when it is no
longer the case".

I agree on the last two counts. I disagree on the first count - 1062
defines Kudos as entities held by a Player, which I take to mean (going
by the above principle) that the NP of being a Player is a prerequisite
to the NP of holding Kudos. It seems to me that ceasing to be a Player
might mean ceasing to have Kudos, as 1062 merely specifies a method of
computing a newly registered person's Kudos according to the Herald's
records - it does not explicitly attach the property of holding Kudos
to a non-Player person.

> Deregistration does strip you of the Nomic Property of being a Player,
> which, if you are a person, is a precondition of being a Voting Entity.

Well now - that depends, again, on how you interpret Rule 206, which
states "Players and Groups are Voting Entities". Undeniably this grants
the NP of being a Voting Entity to any Entity which happens to have the
NP of being a Player, but it is debatable that it removes this NP from
an Entity which no longer has the NP of being a Player. But, again, let's
grant that you are right. It does not matter, as you will see.

Well, at any rate I am the Executor of "Derek Lyons" - whoever he happens
to be IRL, poor Derek. :) 

Possibly he is no longer a Player - but it is nevertheless the case that
I am empowered by the Rules to act on his behalf. And there is _one_ act
that a non-Player can perform that has legal significance.

The following should therefore work even if Elde ceased to be a Player :

H. Registrar,

I hereby, on behalf of Elde as his Executor, request that Elde be registered
as a Player.

H. Assessor,

I hereby, on behalf of Elde as his Executor, announce Elde's Presence on
Proposal 3541.

This may be another newbie question, but what is the situation
concerning the consistency of judgments on different CFJs? Is it just
required by common sense, will it be enforced "politically" (by
appealing conflicting judgements) or are there any formal requirements
a judge must follow?

Of course, past judgements are mentioned explicitly in 217, but only
after the rules, game custom and common sense. So if these more
important criteria lead me to a judgement at variance with earlier
judgements, what do I do?

It is obvious why I am interested in this: In a rather off hand side
remark elJefe included one possible solution to the problems created
by MMM, stating:

>>
I reject the idea that Transfer Orders referred to in Rule 1598 are
the same as the currency supposedly created by the Misanthropists.
That rule defines a TO as an "order" of a certain kind, namely a
directive to do something.  The Misanthropists' currency is a
different kind of object, and does not succeed in confusing the two
concepts. See also CFJ 803.
<<

Note that this does not refer to the main point of CFJ 932 at all -
elJefe judged CFJ 932 based on a completely different argument
connected with the nonexistence of indulgences after the PC reform,
and this has nothing whatever to do with the problems created by MMM.

So: if elJefe's judgement of CFJ 932 is accepted without challenge or
appeal, have we already established the anti-MMM strategy of our
choice, or is it still possible for later judgements directly
concerned with MMM to follow arguments that contradict the quoted
paragraph by elJefe?

By the way, for those concerned - this doesn't imply that I have
already made up my mind about CFJ 931, I'm just trying to find out
whether there is anything left for me to judge after elJefe's ruling.

I'd say it's legal for posterior Judgements to contradict the reasoning
expressed in anterior Judgements, and that the consistency requirement
only refers to the verdict of TRUE or FALSE with respect to particular
Statements. Otherwise it would be possible to sneak in an interpretation
of the Rules in an otherwise trivial Judgement on a completely unrelated
matter.

Not so.  I _needed_ to decide this point.  If I had agreed with Morendil's
argument then I could have judged TRUE without further analysis.  Since I
did not, I _then_ needed to decide whether Indulgences were still a
currency (which truly was not the "main point" of the CFJ).

[BTW, it's 929 that I judged.  932 is still pending.]

I'm inclined to hope that future Judges will be convinced by the reasoning,
but I'm not certain that later judgements are forced to be consistent with
anything besides the judgement of TRUE for the statement in question.

Steve has alerted me to the fact that my record of Rule 1042
has accidentally been truncated--thus, the version printed
in all SLRs and FLRs since Proposal 3522 took effect have
been in error.  The correct FLR version is below.  (The
SLR equivalent is left as an exercise for the reader. :)


Rule 1042/6 (Power=1)
Deregistration due to Absence

      Each Player is exactly one of Not Absent, Maybe Absent, Absent
      or Abandoning.  Whenever a Player posts to the Public Forum, or
      a new Player registers, e becomes Not Absent.

      If a Player posts to the Public Forum clearly identifying a
      particular Active Player, and alleging that that Player has
      Abandoned the game, then the Player alleged to have Abandoned
      becomes Maybe Absent.  If a Player has been Maybe Absent
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a Player has
      been On Hold continuously for sixty days, e becomes Absent.

      Any Player can cause any Absent Player to become Abandoning by
      stating that e is doing so in the Public Forum.

      If the Speaker ever becomes Abandoning, e commits the Class A
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment, e ceases to be Speaker, and the
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker.

      If any Player becomes Abandoning, e is deregistered, and the
      Registrar shall As Soon As Possible announce such in the Public
      Forum.

You flatter me, sir.  I'm not really much of a mail wizard.  I
suppose I know a little more than most, in that I have a
little proficiency in analyzing the headers of forged emails
to determine where they really came from, and I can manage
to write a perl script which writes directly to SMTP.  But
I don't know anything about the internal workings of majordomo.
However, I would guess that your theory is unlikely, in that
I would expect that a program would run through the list
of subsribers faster than the time it would take to get
a bounce message back.

FWIW, I seem to have been receiving yoyo mail without any
problems.

The following sentence is inserted into Rule 1671, immediately 
after the words, "This is the first paragraph." :

     Frankenstien Monsters are individual members of the class of 
     Organization known as Frankenstien Monsters, so this Rule shall

Here's the newest version. I think this should satisfy most of the
problems with the old version... let me know and I'll propose it.

####
PROTO-Proposal: Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies :)
 
Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Amend Rule 1712  ("Distribution of Indulgences") to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players. For each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birthday."

That's a little on the cheating side, I think. The rest I like though I don't 
really see the point, but this is the FM - who needs a point ?

R1011 does not prohibit it. R1011 says that you can't change your
Location except via procedures set out in the Rules. R1707 sets out
this procedure, so R1011 provides no bar to Movement.
