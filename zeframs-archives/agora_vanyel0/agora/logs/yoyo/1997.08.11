Maybe you weren't talking about P-Notes, but R1701 specifies the Promotor as
responsible for this new player reward.  On Tue, 05 Aug 1997 18:37:56 -0400, I
made a PO for this (in the preface to the P-Note report on that day).

Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Mon, 11 August 1997
Date of last Report: Tue, 5 August 1997


STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 3 and 9, which read: 


      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

I selected sentence 3 to be deleted.

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1589, which reads:

####
Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.
####

I selected the sentence

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

I selected the noun "SLC."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms

      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein 
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/38 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a 
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be 
      vacated.  

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms

      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein 
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

I don't know what it is in M:TG, but "brought into play" seems
natural to me.

Is it your position that this is how the Rules do actually (if perhaps
implicitly) work, or is this how you think a Ruleset which respected
epistemologically acceptable principles would be written?

I observe, against the former view, that the Rules do not appear
specifically to direct any Player to create the Rules enacted by
adopted legislation; they rather seem to talk as if the Proposals
create the Rules themselves, and direct the Rulekeepor to reflect
this fact in his record of the Ruleset.

I think I'm talking about a different problem, namely, determining
the legal effects of hacking files. Can the Assessor legally change
your vote by changing your voting message? That depends on one's view
of the relation between votes and voting messages. Are they to be
identified? Or is the message merely a representation of some more
abstract property?

M:TG uses "comes into play" to refer to the action (sometimes "plays" or
"casts" to refer to actions taken by players only), and "receives" to
indicate the creation of something, IIRC. I think "brought into play"
works well, though, and seems the natural analog of "removed from play".

"Entering play," of course. (You could shorten the other to just "leaving
play," which is somewhat more concise and easier to use.)

Interesting... There is not at the moment any default action to come Off
Hold, as it has now become clear that you can move directly to any
Location whatsoever from the Stasis Chamber. Therefore, the above is not
unambiguous as required for the otherwise liberally interpreted Rule 754
to work, and so I would think that it is not possible to use this
formulation.

I guess that means that the above Nomination is not effective either.

Yah, it does.  We clearly need to establish some limit on what sorts

A smallish fraction of mail to that address seems to bounce with "user
unknown", and the rest gets through OK. Harlequin, I'd recommend
unsubscribing and resubscribing with your real address.

DIS: Entities, etc.

I'd like to take a step back for a moment from the detail level that Chuck has
described in eir recent posts concerning Nomic Entities.  I'm not really sure
what we are trying to accomplish here, so I have a few questions and
observations.


Entities in General

Seems to me that, at the top level, there are two kinds of entities.  Let's
call them physical entities and conceptual entities.  Physical entities, of
course, are those that have a real, physical existence (persons, list servers,
messages, stored data).  Conceptual entities are those abstract entities that
we, as Players, have agreed have a particular meaning and significance (at
least, we think we have agreed on this) within Agora (Voting Tokens, Kudos,
Indulgences, etc.)

It is possible to associate conceptual entities with physical entities in a way
that "incarnates" them, so to speak. I see this as being done by treating the
conceptual entity as a property that can be assigned to some physical entity. 
For example, certain data stored on Chuck's computer could be assigned the
property of being the Rules.  This would allow us to treat the Rules as if they
were real, physical entities.

Question 1:  How many of the conceptual entities do we want to associate with
             physical entities?  Put another way, do we want to have any
             purely conceptual entities?

Question 2:  If we retain purely conceptual entities, how would these be
             treated with respect to creation, deletion, and modification
             compared to physical entities?

As for Classes, I think these are candidates for purely conceptual entities. 
Of course, as Scott as pointed out, a class is really just defined by the
common properties of the individual members within the class, so it is not
necessary to think of a class as an entity itself.  I find it useful, however,
to think of them as entities, since we can create, delete and modify class
definitions without requiring the existence of individual members of the class.


Nomic Entities

The idea that an entity is a Nomic Entity iff some rule says it is seems simple
and straight forward, but it has already given rise to some (to me) strange
interpretations - like all persons, living and dead, being Nomic Entities.  The
most simple and intuitive notion to me seems to be to define a Nomic Entity as
all entities (and only those entities) which are officially recognized in some
way by Agora.  This would automatically make Nomic Entities out of all current
Players, past Players, and Observers, but would leave the rest of the living
and dead out of it.  Of course it also makes every entity within Agora a Nomic
Entity.  Which leads to my last question, for now.

Question 3:  What will be the purpose of having some entities within Agora
             designated as Nomic Entities and other entities within
             Agora designated as non-Nomic Entities?


It's difficult for me to evaluate all the hard work that Chuck has done here
without my having a clearer picture of where we are trying to take Agora with
this.  Thanks for your patience.

Regards,
Crito

Agora Nomic
Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Mon, 11 August 1997
Date of last Report: Tue, 5 August 1997


STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 3 and 9, which read: 


      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

I selected sentence 3 to be deleted.

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1589, which reads:

####
Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.
####

I selected the sentence

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

I selected the noun "SLC."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms

      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein 
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/37 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a 
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be 
      vacated.  

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster 
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms

      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein 
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

    Blob currently has 5 Fugitive Blots.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

For everything except the Rules we can of course have Rules that say how
such Crimes are to be corrected. But for the Rules themselves you have a
problem: What if someone removes the Rule that says how forgery is to be
repaired?

Or even without malice - what if there is a disk error that replaces Rules
with 0's: @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@? That sometimes happens with
mail I get.

A middle ground, where the physical record of the Rules is occasionally
ratified as correct, seems more safe. And we haven't really tried that
with the Rules yet. (We once ratified the Point repeal, but not the entire
Ruleset.)

I think Nomic Entities as only those entities explicitly so defined should
be tried.  But at the same time we should _not_ restrict the Rules'
ability to talk about the outside world when wanted. The concept of
"ceases to exist for the purpose of Agora" is too strong in my opinion.

The Rules accidentally fail to prohibit other Movements because 116's
general permission was forgotten.  This was discovered during the debate
after the Virus infected 1708.

As a result of the same infection, The Stasis Chamber is perhaps not
Adjacent to anything anymore. 

In 1707:

      An Entity Moves when its Executor tells the Cartographor where
      it Moves to, given that the Movement is otherwise permitted by
      the Rules.

and in 1708:

      Entities may Move to a Location Adjacent to their current
      Location, unless prohibited by another Rule.

I should have been clearer.  I don't have a problem with logical extensions to
common word definitions like Contest or Kudo (Kudo is not that common though 8)
when it is applied consistently throughout Agora.  I *do* have a problem with
complete redefinitions that are not logical extensions of the original common
meaning, especially if there is a chance that the word may also be used for its
original meaning in some contexts, i.e. the new definition is not used
consistently throughout Agora.

As for what I'm trying to accomplish, that's a good question.
I would say, having found no good general definition of Nomic Entities
and Nomic Properties, but still seeing a need to know what are
and are not NEs and NPs, I am suggesting we take an alternate
route and simply list, in effect, all NEs and NPs.  As I noted
in my draft, this also provides a relatively simple resolution
to the problem of what Proposals can accomplish (currently a
problem due to different possible interpretations of R594).

Classes don't have to be NEs in order to be able to do that.

Well, be careful--that's really two separate issues.  Having all
persons be NEs is not a strict requirement of a system like mine--it
would take only somewhat minor changes to not have all persons
be NEs.  However, there are several reasons why I think it better
to do it this way.  1) I would like all living persons to be NEs,
in order that anything which might cause a GSC is an NE.  Non-player
persons can do at least two things which affect the GS: they
can register, and they can call CFJs.  This is probably just
an aesthetic argument; I don't think it would be difficult to
write a draft similar to mine where non-Player persons are not
NEs, and just allow some non-NEs to be able to make GSCs.  Still,
as aesthetic arguments go, I consider this a rather strong one.
2) Allowing non-Player persons to be NEs means that we can
assign them NPs, which is particularly useful for ex-Players.
(Fugitive Blots, for example.)  Also, it inherently embodies
the concept that when an ex-Player re-registers, e is the same
Player e was before.  3) Dead persons should, IMO, be NEs, to
deal with the possibility that a Player might die without our
knowledge--in this way, dead people can still be Players.  Otherwise
you could get into a situation where you have to recalculate the
past 3 weeks because you didn't realize that Steve was dead,
and thus not a Player (nothing personal Steve, just an example :)
4) People who were dead before Agora was founded should be NEs
to facilitate awarding them patent titles, if we so desire.

I just want people to know that I realize that it seems
bizarre to have all persons, living and dead, be NEs, and
it was not something I did capriciously.

Non-Player persons, as I noted above, can effect at least two types
of GSCs.  Doesn't that make them "officially recognized in some
way by Agora"?  What if we assigned a Patent Title to Thomas Jefferson,
or what if Dr. Suber dies?  Also note that Observers have no
status in Agora beyond any other non-Player person.

Well, I'm not even sure if I'll do this.  It would most likely take
AI=3, and be a *lot* of work, for the Proposal.  I'll probably run
a straw poll in the next week or two, after there's been more
discussion, and if it doesn't seem likely that such a Proposal
would pass, I'll submit the draft as a thesis and be done with it.

Good point.  I'll think about it.  My main concern is that we
should be able to use a single term for both "real" and
conceptual entities ceasing to be NEs, with the desired
effect for each--otherwise, you have to define the difference
between "real" and "conceptual" entities, which just gets us
back into the whole muddle I'm trying to avoid.

How would people feel about transfering the duties for submitting POs
caused by crimes/infractions to one officer (such as the Justiciar or
Speaker)? Would that create problems with the p.c. paradigm? It seems a

to report *all* infractions).

issue POs.

I would rather it not be the Speaker, however. :)
