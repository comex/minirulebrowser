Are you going to go On Hold, assuming that is possible? Am I right in
thinking that you will remain Elde's Executor in Probate even if you go
On Hold, even though you will be absolved of any duties arising of your
holding that position? If so, that's another small loophole in the Probate
Rules that needs to be fixed.

Hi all! Good to see that you have managed to keep this Game in a stable
state of Crisis without my help.

Well, my vacation is over, so I'll attempt to get out of this cold
Chamber. What do you mean, we are in quarantine? A Virus attack?

Fortunately, I have this Acme (TM) Teleport and Time Travel Loophole. I
hereby crawl through it into the Beer Hall.

Too bad it has this side effect of retroactively disconnecting Agora from
other Teleports. I hope we didn't have any lying around... Uh oh. It seems
like we did.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Well, as long as there's someone with the task of recording what Entities 
exist, it should be okay to create those Entities by a Proposal or by a posting 
to the PF - we have much the same situation with the minting of Currencies, 
don't we ?

Nope, that's a different thing - Patent Titles are _granted_ to someone, a
punctual occurrence which nevertheless must be reported, as a historical
event, by the Registrar - there's never been any conclusive evidence that
Patent Titles granted by a Proposal had any existence after that Proposal.

I might, I haven't decided yet. And indeed, being On Hold, I will be relieved
from any active duties (and by a Power=2 Rule at that). However these would
resume as soon as I came Off Hold. What I've been wondering is what would
happen if I placed Elde On Hold too... Wouldn't it be fun if e came back
during my absence, only to find emself a sort of Agora Zombie ? (Well,
assuming the EiP thing really works as I think it does.)

Ah, but even if we grant you all that, that only shows that changing
the name of the Currencies is not illegal. It does not show that you
can actually do it by posting to the Public Forum. In this case, I'm
not sure what it would take to do it.

I don't feel that the quoted message was unclear; it quoted Scott's comment
that the Notary was required to apply the Probate Code, and AFAIK there is
no reasonable doubt at this time that I am the Notary.  However, I'll admit
this part of the COE anyway, since I'm about to admit the other part.

I admit this part of the COE.  A corrected message will be sent as soon as I
figure out what must be done to Elde's estate re Indulgences.

Yes.

Somehow, "...to the extent specified by the Rules" seems closer
to the spirit of my observation. Although the two phrases seem
to have virtually the same meaning, mine seems more likely to
be accepted as being implicit in the Rule itself, whereas yours
(no doubt intentionally) has the feel of an addition.

Agreed.

I quite agree that it comes down to the scope of 'as if'. An
interpretation such as you provide above is certainly in the offing,
and I could have no complaint against a Judge who chose to accept it.
There are, however, alternatives: it seems quite natural to describe
the action of R1738 as granting the Executor in Probate of an entity
the authority, inter alia, to execute Payment Orders as if e were
that entity. So the 'as if' need not necessarily have the widest scope
possible. To be perfectly honest, though, I have to say that if I
were Judging this right now, I'd probably accept your interpretation
as the more natural one.

I'm not really bothered much by this, as long as the Rules require someone (the
Cartographor) to maintain a list of all valid locations.  I think we do need to
come up with some better ways of creating new ones, possibly including letting
the Cartographor do it WO.  I would think, however, that being listing in an
official Agora Report is a Nomic Property.

I think this remark points in a direction we might want to follow to
get out of some of the complications re. Nomic Entities which have
come up recently.

What we want is a way to protect Agora entities and their properties
from arbitrary manipulation by just anyone (of course my attempt to
rename the MMM currencies is just a probing of what restrictions we
already have in this area). At the moment we try to designate some of
these as "Nomic" entities or properties and protect these from
manipulations, with rules like 1011 and 1586.

Steve's idea opens up another strategy: put entities and their
properties under control of relevant officers. Only changes made (or
at least accepted and properly recorded) by this officer are valid. So
locations only exist when created by the cartographor, new currencies
must be passed by the chancellor, currency transfers require the
relevant rekordkeepor (as they do now) etc. 

This doesn't require metaphysics, but it opens new possibilities for
playing: abuse of power, corruption and the measures against them,
etc.

This can, and often does, happen.  It's not majordomo that is
responsible for this, but sendmail (or whatever sendmail substitute is
installed on yoyo).  The order in which messages get sent is not
necessarily the order in which they appear in majordomo's subscriber
list, however; the mailer will attempt to group recipients by their MX
so as to not send two or more copies to the same MX, and other effects
can reorder this list.  Also, load on the machine can, almost
arbitrarily, delay part or all of a large distribution, sometimes in
ways that seem illogical.

Harlequin is permitted to report things in his Cartographer's Report
which are not necessarily Nomic Properties.  

A more interesting question is, will Locations Adjacent to each other
prior to Rule 1708's infection be once again Adjacent to each other
after Rule 1708's disinfection?  Keep in mind that most of these
Adjacencies were established by Proposal, not by Rule.

Is elJefe in Persistent Debt?  I don't think any of his Payment Orders

Good point.  I think most of the extant Locations were created by
Proposal.  Is Rule 594 sufficiently strong to create Locations?  (I
would say no, but my reasoning is probably too Juristic to satisfy
many Players.)

Eek.  "Inter alia."  This marks the first time I have seen that phrase

Scott,

Better send me the P-Note stuff too, just in case.
 I'm convinced that at least the individual
instances of P-Notes ceased to exist, but I'm not
sure about the Currency class of P-Notes.

Regards,
Crito

A comment: A rule to the effect that only nameless entities (such as
currencies) can be created by Proposal would be helpful. I played in a
Nomic Game where proposals did whatever they said, and there were many
entities whose properties were mentioned in the rules but were created
directly by a proposal, which was not a fun state of affairs to keep track
of :-(

Actually, the corrected version of the Herald's Report removed these
Infractions.  But it did so because I consider the POs to be in dispute, since
I believe the higher precedent Rule that defines Indulgences as a Currency
maintains the existence of the class, and hence the validity of the POs. BTAIM,

Oh boy, things are getting just too *weird*. This morning when
I logged on I found in my mailbox duplicates of a whole bunch of
messages dated *June 1*. And it's not that the datestamps were wrong 
either; these were genuine copies of messages that were actually
sent on June 1. I know, I remember seeing them the first time.
An example: Antimatter's message to yoyo resigning the Office of Mad
Scientist after he had some trouble with teleport, plus a bunch of 
responses. It's pretty scary to think that these messages have been
gurgling around yoyo's murky recesses for *2 months* before,
inexplicably, being delivered to me, again. I think the mail setup
on yoyo must be seriously deranged.

I described the symptoms to Geoff last night and his immediate reaction
was "sounds like sendmail weirdness; only to be expected on a student
run machine". I suppose the same weirdness is responsible for the
even more bizarre behaviour evidenced this morning, which I described
in 'Yoyo mondo bizarro' post.

You'd want to be careful. If you're going to be away longer than two
weeks, some mischievous person might decide to allege your (and
Elde's) Absence just after you leave on Friday, and allege your 
(and Elde's) Abandonment two weeks after that, just to see what
would happen :)

G'day Steve,
	Saw your note and figured I'd say "Hello", so, Hello !

	How's things ? Keeping busy I presume. Sometime soon we should 
get together over lunch or similar and catch up.

Better run - got in late and people are stalking me for work... :)

Well, let's hear it anyway, Scott. It's becoming clearer all the time
that R594 has not yet reached the end of its long evolutionary path.
We shall have to confront, sooner or later, the issues surrounding
the extent of R594's authority, ie the general question of what
Proposals can and can't do. It might as well be sooner.

I think these remarks are very interesting, but I think it's a
mistake to explain the difference in metarules between games
like Monopoly and Agora as arising from the fact that Monopoly
is an ftf board game while Agora is an email based game. To me,
it has more to do with the fact that Monopoly is a *family* game,
being pitched at Mums, Dads and kids (see their beaming faces
on the advertisements as, in the process of attempting to send
each other bankrupt, they experience the joys of bonding as a
family unit, thus demonstrating that naked capitalism really poses
no threat to the nuclear family). Cheating is always discouraged
in such games, since Mum and Dad are hardly going to go out and buy
a game that teaches their children to *lie, cheat and steal*,
now, are they? Drive one's competitors into wretched penury by
all means - that's what life's all about, after all, isn't it? - 
but for God's sake do it *honestly*.

I'm sorry, I got a bit carried away there.

My point is really that there are ftf board games that allow
'cheating' as it is normally conceived of in family games.
Illuminati, as Scott mentioned, allows cheating, 'if you can
get away with it'. Cosmic Encounter doesn't allow cheating,
but table talk and conniving about strategy are strongly encouraged.
I recently came across a game called, remarkably, Lie, Cheat and
Steal, although it turned out to be disappointingly conventional.
In the realm of card games we have Cheat and its variations.

Likewise, we should not trace Agora's attitude to scamming to
the fact that it's an email based game. It's entirely to do
with its being a game about exploring the limits of the law.
Artful scamming is a feature of Nomics generally, whether
played ftf or over the Net.

Regrettably, it does not always stop with Kudos. You are, perhaps,
fortunate in not having been here long enough to witness the sad 
scene of a Player deregistering in a sulk, posting a bitter final
missive to the effect that the other Players are, in eir opinion,
quite clearly a deranged and vengeful mob lacking any sense of
decency and honour with whom e is determined to have nothing further
whatever to do. Happens all too frequently, I'm afraid, although
perhaps the frequency is declining. They usually come back after
3 months anyway :)

Personally, I can't tell the difference. Talking about game design,
metarules and the concepts behind them just *is* talking about
metaphysics (legal metaphysics, anyway) and philosophy, as far as I'm
concerned.

I finally caught up with my flatmate, Geoff Wong, last night and we
were chatting about Agora. I told him about our teleport woes. He
told me that he has access to a machine that sounds ideal for our
needs. It basically exists to run Shattered World, a MUD with which
Geoff has had a long term involvement, and it isn't being used for 
anything else, so the load is pretty low. Geoff has root privileges
on the machine (which, by a small coincidence, is called 'gecko',
former Player Wes Contreras' nickname), and he's perfectly happy to
install Majordomo on it. I'd be looking after the admin side of
things. He has access to the machine until at least the end of 1998,
and possibly much longer than that, so it should provide a good
solution in the medium to long term. Hopefully we can get this all
happening by the end of next week. I'll keep you all informed of
developments.

Very good point! Consider closely R594:

      When a Proposal is adopted...the provisions contained in the
      text of the Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent
      permitted by the Rules. 

Even if we allow that the implementation of the provisions of P3475
resulted in the creation of a set of Locations arranged in relations
of Adjacency, it's hard to see how either P3475 or R594 could now act
to reinstate the Adjacency relations, once the infection of R1708
had caused them to disappear.

Nope, only if you have outstanding overdue POs.

Not true. I've used it here before. If I weren't a pompous and
bombastic pseudo-intellectual, I'd just say 'among other things'. :)

I think you would be mistaken if you thought so. Consider the
question: given that the Stasis Chamber exists, does it have the
Nomic Property of being Adjacent to the Origin? (Ignore for now the
infection of R1708.) If all were well, the answer should be 'yes' -
but as things stand, the answer has got to be 'no'. R1011 tells us
that this can be a Nomic Property only if the Rules say that it is.   
And the Rules do not say so. It's true that R1710 says that the
Cartographor is required to record Locations and their Adjacencies
in eir Report, but that does nothing to establish what Locations
actually exist and how they're arranged.

However, from the fact that being Adjacent to the Origin is not
a Nomic Property of the Stasis Chamber, it does not follow that
any Player (even the Cartographor) can set the Adjacency relations of
the Stasis Chamber by posting to the Public Forum. Even though the
Adjacency relations of the Stasis Chamber are not Nomic Properties
and hence not protected by R1011, and even though R116 makes changing
those relations permitted and unregulated, that only means that it is
legal to change them - if you can figure out a way to do it. There's
no reason to think that posting to the Public Forum is such a way.

Things might have been different, though. I think it is perfectly
possible to imagine an email based game of nomic in which, either by
Rule or game custom, it was established early on that the phrase
'permitted and unregulated' in R116 meant not 'legal but not
neccessarily possible' (as judgement and game custom seem to have
established is its meaning here) but 'legal and achievable by posting
to the PF'. I actually think such a nomic would in some ways be more
exciting than Agora, if also more chaotic and unstable, since unless
the Players were exceptionally careful, every mistake they made in
establishing procedures for changing Nomic Properties would result in
the creation of enormous loopholes. Indeed, haven't some of the other
Nomics (Ackanomic, perhaps?) adopted an interpretation somewhat like
this? Ambassador G. Chaos?

Not as busy as I should be, considering my scholarship runs out
on Dec 31...love to catch up. Lunch next Wednesday?
