Nothing prevents me from doing it, in the sense that it's physically
possible. But this would not have the effect of my changing the
contents of your Will, since R1637 says that "A Will is created by
sending to the Notary a collection of text clearly labeled as a Will,
which shall then become that Player's Will...". Once you've sent me
the text, it's the text you send me that becomes your Will, not
your text plus any changes I might make to it. Of course, unless
you keep a copy of your own, you might find it hard to prove that
my edited version of your Will is not really your Will, but the issue
of evidence is orthogonal: you'd have the same problem even if your
Will uncontroversially *was* a Nomic Entity, and even if the contents
of your Will were Nomic Properties and thus ostensibly protected from
tampering by R1011, So I stand by my statement that it really doesn't
matter whether an Application, or a Will in this case, is a Nomic
Entity or not.

Oh, but reading back your post, I now see you were making a different
point: that faking non-Nomic Properties for the purposes of deception
might not be as difficult as I suggest. To that point I respond by
noting that you had to make the example quite far fetched (sending
me your Will on paper) in order to make your point. I think that
any Notary who actually changed a Will in this fashion would very
likely get caught. But even if that weren't so - after all, Wills
are executed upon a Player's being deregistered, so the person most
likely to be vigilant about the veracity of its contents might well
be out of the picture - that still doesn't change my point that it
doesn't matter whether Wills are regarded as Nomic Entities or not.
The problems of duplicitous Notaries are with us precisely to the
same extent regardless of what metaphysical view we take of Wills.

None that I can see, but there's something else needs to be tested
in that regard... Here we go again...

I hereby dispute the above POs and submit a Call For Judgement on the
following:

   No Player is currently authorized to execute Payment Orders for
   Indulgences pursuant to penalties expressed in terms of Blots.

Reasoning :

Rule 1435 goes : to gain or receive Blots is to be subject to a PO for the
same number of Indulgences, and a Player's Blots is the total amount of such
Transfers e has been ordered to effect (that are not disputed or vacated). Thus
a "change in Blots" is precisely the executing, disputing or vacating (but
unfortunately not the satisfaction) of such a Payment Order.

Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report the change
in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules charge no Player with
the responsibility of keeping a record of any particular Payment Orders.

Oh - but I thought that Agoran entities were, in some senses, physical ones.
This refutation of yours seems to imply that there is a Platonic "Morendil's
Will" that is the text that I wrote on that sheet of foolscap, and that this
body of text cannot be changed by the application of a few strokes of pencil to
that same sheet, and further that this 'Platonic' body of text is the one that
has real, legal significance in Agora.

Where in that case _is_ the original body of text, uh ? And which Rule do
you derive the above interpretation from ?

If you remember, there was a change of policy at Teleport a while ago that
mailing list adresses were to become x@lists.teleport.com. I don't know anything 
about Teleport but it's quite possible that the adresses x@teleport.com no 
longer work - we've had ample time to get used to the change now, and possibly 
Teleport just decided to finally get rid of the old mail routings.

This is just speculation, though. A recent post of mine is adressed to 
nomic-business@lists.teleport.com, we'll see if that goes through.

More than likely, they've stopped hosting the lists.  Maybe Coren

Elde's estate is in Probate.  Since it currently has no Executor in
Probate, I hereby nominate Morendil as its Executor in Probate.

According to the latest (July 21) Currency reports, Elde has 17 VTs and
5 P-Notes, and owes 10 Indulgences to the Bank.  To the best of my knowledge,
Elde had no other creditors, and no heirs.  It therefore appears to me that
Morendil ought to submit Transfer Orders as follows:

     17 VTs from Elde's estate to the Bank
     5 P-Notes from Elde's estate to the Bank

and vacate the Indulgence debt of Elde's estate, as it cannot be paid.

Well, I subscribed to and successfully sent a message to the
teleport list test-l, so whatever it is, it's specific to
the nomic lists. :(  The nomic lists are still listed via

Me and my big mouth. :)

Anyway, I wriggle out of the unpleasant aspects of this, i.e. the drudgery of
actually moving Currencies around, until such time as CFJ 930 is Judged at the
least, since by the following provision of the Probate Code I am to hold off on
carrying out my duties as Elde's Executor :

      If, in order to perform the duties required herein, the Executor
      in Probate would have to consider, in any way, a Payment Order
      which is presently disputed, e shall not proceed, but shall wait
      until the dispute regarding that Payment Order is resolved.

There are however far more interesting aspects to the situation. :)

What happens by the way if Elde reregisters now ? If I read the Rules
correctly, I do not stop being eir Executor even if e does. To be sure, I am
"only empowered to submit Transfer Orders for that Entity" but that still
leaves Elde in a sticky situation - and I suspect anyway that the restriction I
quote is in conflict which 1478, which conflict 1738 loses.

And is Elde, for the duration, still a Player, or not ? Whatever the Entity
named (or known as) Elde is, it may not be destroyed until such time as all
appropriate steps in the Probate Code are carried out. If that Entity is the
Player known as Elde (and we adopt, for the sake of "destruction" making any
sense, the recently offered notion that "destroying" an Entity means ceasing to
grant it any legal significance) then Elde will be prohibited from reregistering
by Rule 1432. Also by Rule 1432, I'd assume that if Elde were to reregister, e'd
become "attached" to the same Entity that the Probate Code is protecting...

So : do I get to Vote for Elde ? Or do other such fun things ? Hey, just to
bring this out of the realm of speculation :

  I hereby, on behalf of Elde, announce Elde's Presence on Proposal 3541.

(Hope that's mild enough not to be regarded as a blatant abuse of power.)

Elde is not a Voting Entity; he ceased to be one when he was
deregistered.

Hmm, that is, assuming e ceased to be a Player when e deregistered,
which I just gave a few arguments in support of the contrary.

Even assuming that Elde is no longer a Player (I'll readily admit the above is
a long shot) there seems to remain an Entity of some sort that is associated
with the Nomic Properties that defined "Elde" before eir deregistration. I
surmise that being a Voting Entity is a Nomic Property. It does not seem
impossible that the Elde-Entity has retained that property.

If not, a breakdown of what Nomic Properties were retained (obviously the
Probate Code assumes that an Entity's holding of Currencies are, for instance)
and which were not, if possible with explanations, would be appreciated.

H. Assessor, please record the transfer of one VT from myself to

Also, as of this message and until whatever ails the regular lists is fixed
(or we find another venue, if that's what it comes to) I'll try to adopt a
policy of prefacing Subject: headers with the BUS:, OFF: or DIS: as the case
may be, so that Players who have mail-sorting filters in place (like me !) and
find them screwed up by the switch to yoyo, which unfortunately looks likely
to last a while, can update them to dispatch Agora messages to the appropriate
folders, inboxes or whatever. I urge everyone else to do the same,
naturally...

Eeeek. This is bad. Well, it's a good thing we have a backup list...

So. Who's gonna get us hooked up with three nice new mailing lists?

I don't see how there is any viable argument for claiming that Elde
failed to be a Player when e was deregistered.

How, when there never _was_ a Nomic Entity associated with Elde?
The only change regarding Elde was that e ceased to possess the
property of Playerhood.  Consequential to that change was the loss of
the status of Voting Entityhood.

Elde was placed in probate by the last paragraph of Rule 1601, not by
its first.  The destruction of Elde is clearly far beyond the power of
the Rules to accomplish.
