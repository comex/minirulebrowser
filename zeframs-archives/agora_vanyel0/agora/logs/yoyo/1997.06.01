nomic-official still won't forward my posts. Why not? :-(

I don't think anything interesting happens this week. The potential for future 
changes is (slightly) more interesting, however.

i) There are 12 sentences between the first and last paragraphs. The following 
sentence was randomly deleted:

      A Vote is the name of exactly one of the Candidates for the
      given Frankenstein Monster.

ii.1) Rule 1064 was randomly selected:

Rule 1064/7 (Power=1)
Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class D Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

ii.2) [Hmmm, this is a tough one] The following sentence was chosen:

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.

ii.3) The noun "Rules" was chosen.

ii.4) The revised sentence reads:

      If a Player is mandated by the Frankenstein Monster to 
      maintain a set of records, these records must be available 
      for public perusal, unless such records are designated by the 
      Frankenstein Monster as private.

iii) The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

Rule 1671/26 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      If a Player is mandated by the Frankenstein Monster to 
      maintain a set of records, these records must be available 
      for public perusal, unless such records are designated by the 
      Frankenstein Monster as private.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      Let there be a Frankenstein Monster known as a Patent Title.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Frankenstein
      Monster's discretion.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) Its Frankenstein Monster can not logically admit to either
           being TRUE or FALSE.
      iii) Its Frankenstein Monster does not relate to a matter
           relevant to the Rules.
       iv) Its Frankenstein Monster fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Frankenstein Monster.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      An Organization shall be required to be dissolved whenever any
      of the following conditions are true:

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Frankenstein Monster
      resulting from that act.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

Teleport probably doesn't recognise the address you send from as the same
one you are subscribed with.

For a start, you send from rmorganl@fred.fhcrc.org, but unless the lists
are badly set up that shouldn't make a difference. I also noticed that you
have a
Comment: Authenticated sender is <rmorganl@fred.fhcrc.org>
header in your message, so perhaps your "Sender:" line is different. That
line is replaced by the lists so I don't see it - try sending me a private
message.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I checked. All the lists have exactly the same address for me, and the other 
two work just fine.

I suspect nomic-official might be badly set up, even.

That shouldn't be different when sending to the other lists, though.

Coren set up nomic-official so that only posts from subscribers get
through, to protect us from spammage.  I thought he did the same on

Ah. I'll try changing my address on the list, then. Although it should accept

It appears so from the test I made; only nomic-discussion got the message.
