I'm not sure why my nomic-b posts haven't shown up, but:

I hereby call for the appeal of CFJ 922.

Actually, it's much clearer that R1698 prevents the amendment. It's
still controversial whether in the situation envisaged, arbitrary
modifications to the Ruleset would still be possible. Eljefe's
Judgement of CFJ 917 gives us some reason to think they still would
be, and hence that R114 would not prevent the amendment. That's
why I proposed R1698.
