I posted this Saturday, but teleport seems to have dropped it. Anyways, I am 
resigning (I don't know whether this should be treated as me resigning then or 
now). I will stay in the Mad Scientist's Lab until evicted, however.

News flash: either teleport dropped this *again*, or I'm just getting paranoid. 
Either way, I'm sending it through yoyo this time.
