There is a limit of 40000 characters, which I can change. What
should I change it to? 100000?

How do you interpret R1671: "There is a Nomic Entity known as a
Frankenstein Monster"?

Under the previous Currency regime, you could have argued that
the Frankenstein Monster does not possess a Treasury and is therefore
ineligible to be a holder of Currencies. But PC has done away with
the Treasury concept. Is there anything in the new Rules which
distinguishes between those entities which can possess Currencies
and those which cannot?

Apparently there's no need to change the limits: I've received both
the FLR and the SLR.

If that's the case, then everybody's VT holdings were wiped out too, unless
there is some sort of tradition that suspends the Rules during the time a
proposal takes effect - something I would not expect to exist in Agora.  8)

What a missed opportunity!  Pounds, shillings, pence--such boring names.
They should have been more interesting, like perhaps "MMM-hmm",
"MMM-mmm-good", and of course, the ever-popular "MMM-bop".

This really made me laugh...  M. Herald!  I hereby transfer 1 Kudo

FROM Elde, for all of this zombie-like resurrection behaviour (how rude!)
TO Ørjan, for making me laugh.

I suppose this might not work, but why not sow a little confusion?  And
if the move to the Beer Hall didn't work, at least you can get out of
the Stasis Chamber, because even if it's not adjacent to the Origin, at
least it's adjacent to the Ørjan, which must be almost as good.  };>

Ouch. Looks like Kolja's idea for extremely severe limits on Currency
possession may have been implemented sooner than he expected!

Some of the votes on Proposals 3540-3541 may have been invalidated.
Not that it matters much, since they both failed Quorum anyway.

I haven't gotten them, but I'll take your word for it... but isn't the
ruleset something like 300K nowadays?

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The caller's argument appears to be incorrect:

> Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report
> the change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
> charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
> particular Payment Orders.

This is formally contradicted by Rule 1596, which state, in part "Each
Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders executed
which specify the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor..."

However, as I have argued in CFJ 929, Indulgences having ceased to be
a Currency, no POs can issue in terms of them, and so no player is
authorized to execute such POs pursuant to anything.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1435 goes : to gain or receive Blots is to be subject to a PO for
the same number of Indulgences, and a Player's Blots is the total
amount of such Transfers e has been ordered to effect (that are not
disputed or vacated). Thus a "change in Blots" is precisely the
executing, disputing or vacating (but unfortunately not the
satisfaction) of such a Payment Order.

Therefore, the specification "the Player who is required to report the
change in Blots" points to no particular Player, since the Rules
charge no Player with the responsibility of keeping a record of any
particular Payment Orders.

I call for the appeal of CFJ 932.

As I have argued, R1435 has not been repealed nor had its Power reduced to
zero, therefore Indulgences have either continuously existed as a Currency
because of its higher precedence than R1579 (my opinion), or only ceased to be
a Currency for an infinitessimal period of time - at the moment it ceased to
have a Mintor.

In either case, the Rules currently define a Currency called Indulgences
(although there is no way to create individual instances of this currency) and
for which certain Rules authorize Players to issue Payment Orders (although
there is currently no way for such a PO to be satisfied).

I agree with Crito that R1454 takes precedence over R1579 by virtue of
its higher number.  I don't think that the Judge's argument (first
stated in the judgement of CFJ 929), that "we've had currencies
lacking a Mintor cease to exist before this" is sufficient response to
this argument, and believe that even if valid, this should be
investigated more thoroughly.  (Were these previous Currencies deemed
to have disappeared because they had a lower precedence rule defining
them R1579?)

I therefore call for the Appeal of CFJ 932, and encourage others to do
so as well.

Michael.

At the time of eir reregistration, Elde had 13 Fugitive Blots.


The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

May as well get this officially on the table.

I claim that the Report of Voting Token Holdings
dated August 3 is incorrect as it does not take
into account the destruction of all Voting Tokens
that occurred when the Pragmatic Currency Proposal
took effect.

BUS: Blob Fails to Report

Steve reported:

>Blob failed to produce a Wizard's Report during the week just
>completed, and so commits the Infraction of Failure to Report,
>which carries a penalty as for a Class D Crime.

R1504 requires Steve to issue Payment Orders that result from the application
of this penalty.  I don't think we resolved the issue of whether this
constitutes implicit Payment Orders for Indulgences and VTs, although I have
the impression that this will not be allowed.

I hope we can get the question of the status of Indulgences settled quickly.

Even if we grant the ability of Rule 1671 to create entities, it's not
clear that the entity thus created is _THE_ Frankenstein Monster.
Furthermore, in light of other Rules, such as Rule 1062, it's possible
that Rule 1671 merely creates a class of entities known as
Frankenstein Monsters, without actually creating any individual
Frankenstein Monsters.  There might be more than one, for all I know.
In any case, the Chancellor has previously reported that there are no
Frankenstein Monsters, and nobody has challenged that claim.

Not that I can tell.

Denied, with the comment that I would rather that people challenge
interpretations of law with CFJs instead of COEs.  Don't make Officers
make decisions of law; COEs should be used for correcting errors in

BUS: Claim of Error too

I claim the Assessor's report dated Aug 3 is also in error since it fails to
account for the fact that proposal 3540 must have been disinterested due to the
destruction of P-Notes which prevented any Proposal fee from being paid.  As a
result of this, the reward of a P-Note for Andre mentioned in the report is
also invalid.

My apologies.  However, in my defense, decisions have already been returned in
the case of Indulgences and P-Notes that would indicate this particular
question of law has already been settled.  This is certainly the case for my
next Claim of Error that you may have just received.

I don't think this is the case.  There are sufficient distinguishing
issues involved to discount a blanket application of the precedents
you cite.

Sounds like a particularly un-Agoran thing to do.  8)

In any case, the currency auto-validation is no more (it also went bye-bye with
the PC proposal).

You are probably right.

OK, so H. Clerk of the Courts take note:

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following statement, barring Scott.

All Voting Tokens were destroyed as a result of the Pragmatic Currencies
Proposal taking effect.

Arguments:  As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting
Tokens also ceased to have a Mintor.

This is a COE on the Notary's Report of July 22, which has Murphy as a
Contestant of the Democratic Movement, apparently based on the following
(slightly abbreviated) exchange:

I do not think this was legal; At the time Rule 1472/3 had the following
requirement for Transfers:

      b) The transfer must be of a positive amount of exactly one
         Currency, and that amount must be an exact integral multiple
         of that Currency's MUQ.

In English mathematical usage, positive does not include zero.
In other words, zero Transfers were not legal at the time.
(It still isn't under the new Rules, I believe.)

It occurs to me that given the 4 Day restriction it would not be
unreasonable simply to declare the Stasis Chamber adjacent to all other
Locations.

No, that's still too little. The SLR is 250000 characters, the FLR
even longer (I have no copy ready, so could not count).

They will be in the draft I'm writing...but then, NEs in
that are quite a bit different than current NEs. :)

I still haven't seen them either, so it seems likely that the
General is correct.

I'll wait till later this week to send them out, since the new
lists may be up by then.  If anyone needs it before then, just
let me know and I'll send it to you directly.  If the end of
the week approaches and the new lists aren't up yet, I'll
see if they'll go out over yoyo, and, if not, send the SLR
directly to each player.  (The FLR only has to be published once
each month, so there's no hurry on that one.  Of course, I'll
be happy to send a copy directly to anyone who wants one.)

As for Andre's offer to set up a list, perhaps it would be
good if you could set up one to use as a backup?  It
probably wouldn't hurt to have a backup list maintained
by a different person than the main ones.  Not that I
expect Steve to go AWOL, but it can't hurt.

Well I wouldn't ordinarily play so hard, but pushing the envelope in this
case seems well within the spirit in which Morendil has been playing.
I'm pretty sure he won't mind. Besides, in the first place, I warned
him in advance I might try this, and he didn't avail himself of the
opportunity to go On Hold. I think he may have *wanted* me to try it.
And in the second place, I think there's a good chance he'll return
before the deadline in any case, post messages on behalf of himself
and Elde, and so avoid deregistration. But we shall see.
