Part of the charm of the Virus is that it can show, by direct demonstration,
if a Rule is a good candidate for upmutation. But don't bother with MI=1.5.
Why not just go straight to MI=2? Integral MIs are more elegant, and a 
difference of 0.5 will scarcely show up.

True enough. However, I still think you are able to submit a Judgement
on Elde's behalf.

I think the effect of the Plots proto is better summed up by saying
that it would have us become Farmers, Miners, Builders, etc. A
declaration in the Public Forum that "I hereby become a Farmer" does
not turn me a farmer. (Well, in this case, neither would the
declaration "I hereby become a farmer." But you take the point, I'm
sure.) This is the same discussion we had about Locations versus
locations.

I'm pretty sure that's not what Scott is denying.

The relevant Rule is R880/4, which states:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.

There is a question concerning whether the phrase "within seven days"
means "within the seven day period immediately following the appointment"
or "within the period seven days on either side of the appointment".
Cf the language used in the Rule on temporary Delegation, R1645(iii),
which is explicit on this point:

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

At any rate, I'm going to go ahead and interpret R880 using the second,
more liberal of the readings suggested above. That means I accept your
first message expressing your consent to be appointed Wizard as having
been legally effective in expressing your consent to be appointed, even
though it was posted before General Chaos' notice of resignation.

Sigh. We can't all have your flair, Morendil. But then, being French, 
you have an unfair advantage. :) I do try to keep the game interesting.
What what you have done in my position?

Possibly the same thing, come to that - but then I'd certainly have
acknowledged the possibility of losing Honour by doing so - I think it was
Vanyel, wasn't it, who classified the act as 'evil' ? ;)

I nearly refrained, but there was the matter of that Kudo taken from Elde
emself, so you can console yourself with my assurance that this was rather
more a case of  'I want to transfer a Kudo to someone and need a victim'.

======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals (unofficial)
======================================================================

Proposal 3543 (Harlequin) (Disinterested) AI = 1
Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies

Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Amend Rule 1712  ("Distribution of Indulgences") to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players: for each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birthday."

I hereby submit a Claim of Error regarding the above statement and disputing
the corresponding Payment Order, in that due to CFJ 932, pertaining to the
legality (or lack thereof) of Payment Orders for Indulgences in general, and
in particular all of those naming Blob as Payor, all such Payment Orders are
currently Disputed, and as such Blob has no Overdue Payment Orders in
Indulgences currently assessed against em.

Therefore, either Blob is also subject to other Payment Orders, in either
Voting Tokens or P-Notes - and I don't know about any such, and request to be
informed of any by the appropriate Recordkeepors if there are - or the above
is mistaken, in which case I humbly request that this Claim be admitted and the
above Orders vacated under the authority of Rule 1733.

DIS Re: OFF: Bank Transaction Notices

Scott wrote the following Transfer Orders:

>New Player Award
>  Executor: Promotor Crito
>  Date: Tue, 05 Aug 1997 18:37:56 -0400

>  to Vlad,            5   P-Notes

>  Executor: Promotor Crito
>  Date: Tue, 12 Aug 1997 09:27:19 -0400

>  to Calabresi:       5   P-Notes

Now here's an interesting conundrum for Scott.  Since Harlequin's currency fix
passed, Scott was able to create the 10 P-Notes required to satisfy these TOs
and, as the Bank's Executor is empowered to transfer them as described. 
However, if the Courts rule that P-Notes were not a Currency between the time
of PC and Harlequin's fix, then the messages I sent as Promotor regarding New
Player Awards for P-Notes were not really POs - they were just messages that
incorrectly claimed to be POs.  If that's the case, then Scott just issued TOs
on behalf of the Bank without there being corresponding POs.  The text of the
Rule below indicates that Scott may have just commited the Class A Crime of
Misappropriation.  Maybe Scott should start lobbying the Courts for a True
verdict on my P-Note CFJ.  8)

Rule 1735/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor as Bank's Executor

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or
      CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player
      makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

If it is legal for me to do so, and noting in passing that I feel decidedly
uncomfortable doing so and mostly want to avoid Elde's garnering more Blots, I
hereby, on behalf of Elde and acting as Elde's Executor, return a Judgement of
FALSE.

Argument is the old saw, "Just because it's permitted doesn't mean it's
possible", specifically in this case the fact that there is a well-defined
procedure in the Rules for granting initial Names to Currencies created under
the aegis of Rule 1722, but no procedure exists to change these inital Names.

I further reject the arguments that Currencies legally minted under the
provisions of Rule 1722 are not Nomic Properties under the definition of Rule
1011, in that the property of being named "Payment Order" and so on is granted
to the Entities thus created by Rule 1576, which requires that all Currencies 
must have a Name, as the Caller justly notes, and by Rule 1722, which I 
interpret as, by implication, requiring that the name of such a Currency be 
that which is specified in the message which purports to create it.

To reason otherwise would lead to a pitfall. If we interpret Rule 1722 as *not* 
requiring that the specific values of properties attached to a Currency be 
those specified in the creating message, but merely attaching particular 
conditions to the message which effects the minting a Currency, which 
conditions would then be irrelevant to the actual values of the corresponding 
properties in the newly created Currency, then we are left with a Currency 
which either does not have any of those properties (and thus cannot legally 
exist) or for which the value of those properties is indeterminate, which I 
find abhorrent, especially as the same fate must befall *all* Currencies so 
created.

Ooops. I must apologize, in particular to H. Assessor General Chaos, for a
mistake in submitting a COE on the subject Official Document - I originally
intended to mention my most recent CFJ on the matter of Indulgence POs, before
I realized that, not having been assigned to a Judge by the CotC, that CFJ was
not legally sufficient to make the relevant POs disputed. In a classic case of
one's desires blinding one to reality, I reviewed my archives of Official posts
and missed Michael's published final Judgement on CFJ 932.

As things stand, and irritating as I find it in light of my observations re
the Judgements returned in 932, it does seem that outstanding Indulgence POs
are currently not disputed.

Hmm.  No one ever responded to my post about the

Am I right in assuming that this Proposal - which has presumably restored
P-Notes and Indulgences to a functional and determined state - leaves the
status of VT holdings currently unresolved ? What is the consensus on that
issue ?

Before you get too CFJ happy, keep in mind that a conviction would
require my removal from Office.  Who here wants to be Chancellor?  I
warn you, it's quite a bit of work.

Secondly, I believe it is improper, even if not illegal, to prosecute
or convict someone for a crime when e acted on informed belief of the
correctness of eir actions.  Thus, any prosecution will be met with
appropriate Kudo transfers.  

Furthermore, both of those Payment Orders were issued by you, Crito,
and if you didn't believe in their veracity, perhaps you are guilty of
a Class C Crime by making them in the first place.

Scott sez:

 > Blob is hereby cited for Persistent Debt.  Elde, as Blob's Executor in
> Probate, is hereby ordered to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank.

BTW, I'm slightly confused - how come this should appear in the Assessor's 
Report ? I suspect that you are reading Rule 1713, which states, of Persistent 
Indebtedness (not Persistent Debt, btw, but it's certainly unambiguous) :

      Each Recordkeepor is authorized to report this Infraction, which
      carries a penalty of one Blot.

to mean that _all_ Recordkeepors are authorized to report _all_ such
Infractions. I would prefer a much more natural reading, in which "each
Recordkeepor" is authorized to report this Infraction with respect to the 
Currency e is a Recordkeepor for. I can make little sense of Rule 1713 if it 
authorizes the Assessor to report Indulgence Debt Infractions, which are more 
properly the province of the Herald.
