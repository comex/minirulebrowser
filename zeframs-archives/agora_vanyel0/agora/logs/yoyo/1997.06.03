BTW, Steve,  I _did_ send you a vote last week, but it bounced.  I also
sent it to nomic-business, but for some reason it didn't show up there
either...

Subject: THRT: Group vote in 3494-3501

Fellow Threats, especially including H. Assessor Steve:

In the vote on Proposals 3483-3493, the members' recommendations were as
follows:

               3                 3
               4                 5
               9  9  9  9  9  9  0  0
               4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1

Steve             A
elJefe            A
Gen. Chaos        A  F  A  S  F  S  S
Blob              A

Threat           3A


S = either For or Against (I think Pumpkin Patch has/had a vote called "SHEEP")


In accordance with our Ordinances, the Group spends 3 VTs to cast a unity
vote in 3495 (casting 3 votes AGAINST 3495, as indicated).

The group does not vote in the other Proposals.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Threat Vizier
