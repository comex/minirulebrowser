Nomic-business quietly failed to forward the following messages (in reverse 
chronological order). Recordkeepers, take note. Apologies if any of the 
following actually did get through.

Also missing are two Internomic Proposals, which I do not have copies of on 
this computer. One was "Amend the rules by removing Rishonomic from the list of 
voting members", I believe.

I _thought_ I had this problem fixed... :-(

Due to a sudden lack of time for Agora, I am taking whatever steps are 
neccessary to put myself On Hold.

H. Notary!

I hereby transfer one Kudo FROM Morendil, for actions which I regard as highly
dishonorable, TO Harlequin, since he was most directly damaged by Morendil's
actions.
