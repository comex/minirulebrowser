I don't think that the disinfection of R1708 has re-established
Adjacencies. They were only established in the fist place by P3475;
they ceased to exist with the infection of R1708; no Rule exists
to give them back to us. Therefore we ain't got 'em.

On the other hand, R1707 allows Movement to any Location.

Just send a message to the list saying that you are registering.

I just got a message from tmbg.org saying that the aliases had some
delivery problems over the weekend, but that they've been fixed. So
everything should be fine now. Steve, if you could forward me the 16
messages which bounced from my address, I would greatly appreciate it.

Perhaps I haven't been paying close enough attention, but I
wasn't aware that there was any problem with the definition
of Nomic Property in R1011. There does seem to be some unclarity
in our metaphysical views on what, for instance, votes really are.
Perhaps that amounts to the same thing?

I don't know if those who keep track of this (i.e. Steve) would agree, but
I'd say that message pretty much did it. :) Do you have a nickname/handle
which you'd like to use within the game, or would you just like to be
"Brian"?

I think it might be a good idea, as long as we continue to allow the relevant

I tend to disagree. Only when the message explicitly states that it is
a registering message I would not count it as such. What if, for example,
Brian happened to want to make some WWW-page on Nomics, and went around
all webnomics he knew to obtain such information?

However, the point is rather moot, at least in this case, as his next message
to me seems like a registration message beyond doubt.

  Assigned to Elde, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Evidence and arguments: See my message of 30.07.97 to the public
forum (attached).

Relevant rules: 116, 1011, 1576. (And, in principle, the other rules
pertaining to the creation of currencies, their properties and the
mintor's and recordkeepor's duties and abilities.)

----Att. 1: Message of 12.07.97 to the public forum (from Morendil)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

H. Chancellor,

I hereby announce and effect, on behalf of the Misanthropist's Group,
the creation of three Currencies, with the following characteristics,
as per the provisions of Rule 1722 :

Name: Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Payment Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1

Name: Transfer Orders
Mintor: The Misanthropist's Group
Recordkeepor: Morendil
MUQ: 1


----Att. 2: Message of 30.07.97 to the public forum (from Kolja A.)

[header snipped to avoid confusing mail readers]

I hereby rename the currencies created by Morendil on behalf of the
Misanthropist's Group in a message of 12.07.97 to the public forum as
follows:

Old name                         New name
---------------------------------------------------------
Orders                           MMM-pounds
Payment Orders                   MMM-shillings
Transfer Orders                  MMM-pence


---
Remark

"Wait, you can't do that! These names are a Nomic Property (NP) of
these currencies and protected by 1011!"

No, they are not. What _is_ an NP is the fact that they do have a
name, i.e. are not nameless. This is explicitly required in 1576, and
not changed by changing the names.

But the particular names were given in a message to the public forum
(unlike the names of rule-defined currencies like VTs, which are given
in the relevant rules). So they are not Nomic Properties, after all,
and not protected by 1011.

Kolja A.

In both cases I OVERTURN the given judgement, and call for the
judgement to be reversed. 

The following text is my argument for both cases:

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde. 

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.  

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency". 

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

I think it's a bit vague, having the same problem with "solely
defined by the Rules" as the definition of NE using that
phrase.

I do not believe that asking how to register can reasonably be

DIS: Executors in Probate

Given the zombie-like behavior of Elde recently, I notice we probably need to
shore up the Executor in Probate code a little.

1)  Carrying out the probate "in a timely manner" should be changed to "as soon
    as possible" for those actions not subject to dispute.

2)  There should be a provision which allows the Notary to remove an Executor
    in Probate for an ASAP violation (or other violations that anyone thinks
    appropriate), and assign a new EiP.

3)  Obviously, we need to reword things to restrict the powers of the EiP to
    only what was intended.

I'll be glad to work something up, unless Players feel this is unecessary or if
the original proposor would like to do the honors.

No, but I was talking about classes being entities, not necessarily Nomic
Entities.  I'm willing to concede, for the sake of avoiding argument, that my
view of classes as entities may be more aesthetic than substantive.

True.  It's not necessary to have it that way, but it is possible.  My point
was that defining NEs this way makes them arbitrary and can result in the
assignment of NE status in non-intuitive ways.

I can see that.  And I did assume that you had good reasons.  8)

The way I envision Nomic Entities, as an intuitive concept, also works in these
cases.  1)  Non-Players become Nomic Entities when they register, when they
become recognized as the caller of a CFJ, when they become officially
recognized as an Observer, when they are awarded a Patent Title (such as
Agoraphobe).  2)  Ex-Players are already Nomic Entities because we continue to
recognize their existence officially as potential re-registrants and as having
NPs, like Fugitive Blots.  3)  A Player who dies is still recognized within
Agora after eir death, so e is still a Nomic Entity (as in 2).  4)  Thomas
Jefferson becomes an NE when you award a Patent Title to him.  I see this as
happening automatically if you define NE in such a way that any entity
"officially recognized" by Agora *is* a NE.

I don't mean to imply that there is anything wrong with Chuck's way of defining
NEs.  I think it is perfectly reasonable.  But to me, the intuitive notion of
NE is that everything in a Nomic is an NE and everything that is *not* in a
Nomic is not an NE.  I still would like to know what use people would like to
make of the distinction between NE and non-NE within the game.

This puts the EIP in risk to ASAP violations consequent to a

time.  Until Agora gets the concept of consequential damages, I will
oppose this.

That seems reasonable.  I would recommend the Without Objection
mechanism.  I'd kinda like to see a judicial review option added to
the W/O mechanism, too (the question being whether the change was
reasonable).  Perhaps a review by referendum instead.

Granted.

I don't think Brian's first message constituted a declaration of
Registration. His second message certaily did though, and he is
Registered as of that message.

Welcome to the game, Calabresi!

Never fear, Scott: no doubt we will continue to think so. :)

Amazingly, Calabresi is the first law student to my knowledge to
Register to play Agora in its 4 year history.

Personally, I think Nomic should be compulsory for all law students :)
It's certainly provided *me* with an education.

And what a great job you're doing!

This is really interesting. Elde is registered and not On Hold or
otherwise ineligible, so e is eligible to be selected. However, 
Morendil who is acting as Elde's Executor, is barred. Does this mean
that Morendil cannot return Judgement? I think he can, since R1478
empowers Morendil to act "as if e were" Elde.

Morendil will be licking his chops when he gets back from his holiday.
That is, unless I have him deregistered for Abandoning first :)

The question is: is that more or less annoying than having EiPs
who simply twiddle their thumbs and don't carry out probate, relying
on the (I take it) deliberate vagueness of the phrase "in a timely
manner"?

We can't use the W/O mechanism for this purpose as R1728 is currently
written, because any Player, even the EiP guilty of the ASAP violation,
can Object.

Regrettably, the messages bounced to me with message bodies suppressed.
So: no can do :(. I can't even send you the archive because achive
retrieval on yoyo seems to be broken. Double :(. But Scott and Vanyel
probably have the messages archived.

Geoff tells me that the installation of majordomo on gecko, our
prospective new home, is nearly finished. The delay has been
partly caused by a bout of food poisoning. Triple :(.

Add a provision to 1728 to allow for the barring of objections by a
limited number of Players, when it is appropriate.

That's a slightly inaccurate picture of the situation. Here are
the two definitions:

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

There's an importance difference in what is being defined. The
definition of Nomic Entity talks about entities being defined to
exist, whereas the Nomic Property definition talks about entities
being defined as possessing certain properties.

Still, I offer this alternative for your perusal:

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity to which the
      Rules attach legal significance.

      A Nomic Entity is an entity all of whose properties are
      Nomic Properties.

I just suggested a new definition of 'Nomic Property' for R1011:

      A Nomic Property is any property of any entity to which the
      Rules attach legal significance.

I note that this definition may be superior to the current one,
in that it is quite clear, for example, about the legal status
of hacking voting messages. The contents of a voting message
clearly are Nomic Properties on the new definition, which they
arguably are not on the current one, and so cannot be legally 
changed except via procedures specified by the Rules. So hacking
voting messages would be illegal. This doesn't settle one way
or the other what the legal effect of such hacking is, however,
which I take to be a further question.

I suggest also that this new definition might make it easier
to go ahead with a plan of marking certain properties as
protected, and allowing unprotected properties to be changed
via messages to the PF. I want to stress that this suggestion
about protected properties is not a metaphysical proposal, but
motivated purely by considerations about game design (eg a desire
to enliven play).

The problem being that, not having *received* the messages, I don't know
which ones I'm missing. Quadruple :(. But I haven't seen any posts replying
to messages I haven't seen, so perhaps it's just

Oh, goody. Hmmm. What are we going to call the lists? Perhaps it would be
good to stick to n-d, n-o, and n-b for historicity and ease of remembrance,
but that seems so, well, retro. At the very least, it might be nice to
change "nomic" to "agora." (I would go for "agora-dis," "agora-bus," and
"agora-off" myself, for conciseness, and since the abbreviations match the
little tags at the beginning of the Subject headers...)

I tend to think that this is trivially defeatable.  All it takes to
de-Nomic-Entitify some entity is for someone to assign some property
to it to which the Rules do not attach any legal significance (such
as, say, by naming my VTs).  I don't see how you can regulate around
this.
