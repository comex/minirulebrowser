H. Assessor,

I hereby vote AGAINST Proposal 3550.

I went back and forth on this a lot, but finally
decided, if we don't want the Virus to be able to
do anything really drastic, we may as well just
get rid of it.  Our experience so far has been, if
it doesn't touch anything important, it has no
interesting effect on the game.  It only seems to
postpone certain actions until the Virus
dissipates.  I say, let the Virus do it's worst or
get rid of it.

Crap. I mentioned that I HATE NETSCAPE MAIL, right?

I hereby declare presence on P3550.

I hereby vote for myself for CinC, Kolja A. for CotC, and Murphy for Notary.
