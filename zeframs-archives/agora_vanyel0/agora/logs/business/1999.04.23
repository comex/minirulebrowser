I transfer 1 Kudo from Steve, for repealing Summary Adoption in an
inelegant, unethical, and Criminal way, to Michael Slone, for being far
too harsh on himself as a new player.

Yes.  Although I understand the strong feelings this has generated, Steve's
history and eir actions in this scam make it clear that these kinds of accusations
are without merit.  I hereby vote AGAINST in the impeachment referendum.

Well, of course this particular loophole, dangerous as it was, would have
been closed by my Safeguard proto-proposal - my preferred method
of resolution 8).  With that available, I don't think I would say that
your (ab)use of your position as list administrator was justifiable.  But
it certainly mitigates against the magnitude of punishment and the
personal attacks against Steve's integrity.

I would say that Steve's zeal against SA got in the way of eir better
judgement in this case, but I don't have any fears of real subversion
from em.  I hope Steve will stay with us and the rancor will subside.
E has contributed much to the game and I, for one, really
appreciate it.  If any of Steve's most ardent opponents are
"role-playing", I think now would be a good time to \role off.
