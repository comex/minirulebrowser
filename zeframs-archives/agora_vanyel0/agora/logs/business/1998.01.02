Repeal-O-Matic

The latest SLR shows 288 Rules in the current Ruleset.  This weeks random
numbers were 260, 34, 159, 81, 98.  These correspond to the following Rules,
based on the order published:

R1397 Dissolution of Organizations
R1042 Deregistration due to Silence
R1681 The Logical Rulesets
R1451 Disowning Proposals
R1690 Power of New Rules

Disolving Organizations and the Logical Ruleset are too useful, IMO, for
selection.  Deregistration for Silence is recent, and also nice to have. 
Leaving the Power of new Rules unspecified might make for some interesting
debates, but I think it would only force proposers to make it explicit in each
proposal - which would just be a nuisance.  That leaves Disowning Proposals. 

Seems reasonable that we might want to let a proposer hang in the breeze rather
than letting them off the hook by Disowning.  So, R1451 is the Repeal-O-Matic
selection this week.  If anyone wants to pay the fee, refer to it either by its
name, Repeal Rule 1451, or by its assigned number P3659.  I do not include its
text here, to avoid confusion with proposing and/or distributing this proposal.
