Actually, Scott has already appealed it. And so, hereby, do I. Now

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
>      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a
>      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

A first draft. How's it look?

####
Proto-Proposal
Liberalize Annotations

WHEREAS it is desirable that Judicial decisions which set precedent
as to how Rules are to be interpreted in the future be incorporated
into the Ruleset as Annotations, so that they may be kept ever fresh
before us, even if these decisions did not result from a CFJ on Rule
Interpretation being Judged TRUE, be it hereby resolved that the
Title of Rule 789 be changed to "Annotating the Ruleset" and that the
Rule be amended to read:

      If a Judge of a CFJ is of the opinion that eir Judgement of
      that CFJ sets a precedent as to how a Rule is to be interpreted, 
      then e is permitted to issue an Injunction requiring the
      Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule. Such an Injunction is called
      an Injunction to Annotate. Once such an Injunction has taken
      effect and the Rule has been annotated, the annotation, while
      it exists, shall guide the application of that Rule.
  
      Similarly, if a Board of Appeals is unanimously of the opinion
      that its Judgement of an Appeal sets a precedent as to how a
      Rule is to be interpreted (that is, it is unanimous in its
      opinion as to what that precedent is), the Board is permitted
      to issue an Injunction to Annotate.

      To be legally binding upon the Rulekeepor, an Injunction to
      Annotate must include a copy of the Statement of the CFJ and
      indicate what the Judgement of the CFJ was.

      In addition, an Injunction to Annotate may include further 
      material explaining precisely how the Rule is to be interpreted
      and the Judge's reasons for favouring this interpretation.
      However, this further material is not to exceed 20 lines at 70
      characters per line. If it does, then the Injunction to
      Annotate is not binding upon the Rulekeepor, although the
      Rulekeepor is permitted to obey the Injunction should e choose
      to do so.
      
      If a Player believes that the circumstances leading to the
      Judgement no longer prevail, rendering the annotation
      inapplicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is Judged
      TRUE, the annotation is removed. Furthermore, the Rulekeepor
      is permitted to remove annotations Without Objection.

####

In writing the above, certain questions have occurred to me:

1. How, precisely, does a Board of Appeals issue an Injunction? This
is not a problem I am creating, since Boards are already empowered
to make Injunctions by R663 and by other Rules. But the Rules are silent
concerning the mechanism for this. A natural idea is that Board use the
apparatus of Applications and Signatures, but this raises a new question,
namely:

2. Would it be desirable to undertake a more sweeping reform of the
Injunctive process, one which would see Injunctions become a special
case of Applications? R1628 gives quite general powers to Applications, 
so it appears they could be used for the purpose.

3. Do we need to worry about Injunctions to Annotate which are Appealed
more than 3 days after they are published by the CotC in the PF? (see
R1571) It seems these Injunctions have by then already taken effect
and guide the application of the Rule they annotate. What I'm concerned
to avoid is a situation in which an Appeal of an Injunction is denied
on the grounds that the very annotation whose status is in question
indicates that the Appeal should be denied. That's a denial of natural
justice in my view,

instead. I am sending this to the PF because I got the odd one out and
I wish to solicit comments.

I hereby Dismiss both of these CFJs under 1565 (iii): these Statements
are (obviously) not relevant to the Rules.

Arguments from interested parties solicited on this one.  Note that
although the caller may have had the current batch in mind when putting in
this Statement, I will not probably not consider the current batch of CFJs
very important for this issue.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Oh yeah? I hereby dismiss the following CFJs assigned to me under 
*R1563*.  :)

947, 966, 969, 976, 980, 1002, 1003, 1029, and 1034.




I do not believe that they are  "able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE."
      
In addition, I consider them "vacuous" under this same rule.

Note that only one of these conditions needs to be met to dismiss 
them...I include both in the hopes of avoiding argumentation. Not that I 
really have any hope of that. :)

I hereby make and admit the following COE:

The posting of CFJ 1045 is in error, in that the CFJ was not called by
Kolja A., but by Vir.

No new choice of Judge is necessary, as Kolja A. simply takes Virs
place on the eligibility list.

The corrected version of the important part of the CFJ is as follows:

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1045

  CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 do not contain a statement of the sort
      required by rule 1563, and as such, must be dismissed.

======================================================================

Judge:       Morendil

Judgement:   <>

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
             elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
	     Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement:

======================================================================

CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 do not contain a statement of the sort
required by rule 1563, and as such, must be dismissed.

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vàk´y¡-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vac´uously adverb
- vac´uousness noun

The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright © 1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

You are correct.  1563 says that I must dismiss it, and also that the rules
for dismissing it are found elsewhere, namely Rule 1565.

I hereby dismiss CFJs 950, 979, 988, 1005, 1020, and 1041 under Rule 1563
because they cannot be determined logically to be either TRUE or FALSE and
because they are vacuous.

Evidence (applies equally to all 5 statements): Rule 1563, Rule 1565.

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Rule 1565/3 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 3
      Mil.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

I do not think that antimatter could bar Elde and Blob from judging.
That right is restricted to Players. It's not that R897 explicitly
prohibits non-players from barring, but it fails to give any effect
to their attempts to do so.

This is a COE.
