Sure.  Under the authority of Rule 1727, I pay out 5 VTs to the "Pass
the Parcel" Contest, and I pay out 2 P-Notes to Blob.

(I had thought that R1727 required me to do this during Agora's Birthday;
having missed that opportunity, I had intended to pay out of my personal
funds instead.  VTs and P-Notes I can spare, sort of.)

I am willing to give the Parcel contest another short, this time
over a week rather than a day. Note that as soon as the POs for VTs
Murphy ordered are fulfilled, under the current regs, I am required
to distribute those funds, and dissolve the Contest. So before 
that happens, I propose we change the Regulations and try again.

I intend to change the Regulations of the Pass the Parcel contest
to read as set out below. By rule 1612, these changes can only
take place given the unanimous consent of all current Contestants.
By my interpretation of events, this means Crito and Steve (and
me too, as Contestmaster). I consent to these changes.

Blob

---

The Regulations of the Pass the Parcel Contest shall be amended 
to read as follows:

1. The Music

   Any player may become a Contestant by informing the Contestmaster
   that e wishes to do so, provided that this is done before mindight
   GMT on the morning of Monday June 13. At that time, the Music 
   shall begin.

   After the Music has begun, no more Contestants will be accepted. 
   A Contestant may leave the contest at any time, by informing the
   Contestmaster that e wishes to do so. Contestants may also be
   required to leave the Contest, as the Regulations dictate.

2. The Parcel

   There exists an entity called "The Parcel" which is at any given
   moment in time, held by one Player. Initially the Parcel is held
   by the Contestmaster. The Player holding the Parcel may pass it
   to another Contestant, by posting a message to the Contestmaster
   and all Contestants stating that e does so. 

3. Seating Arrangements

   The Contestmaster shall keep an ordered list of all Contestants.
   This list is called the "Seating List", and shall be sent to
   all Contestants. After the Music begins, the Contestmaster may
   not change the Seating List, except to remove any Contestants
   who leave the Contest.

4. The Layers

   The Parcel has five Layers, each of which contains a certain 
   number of VTs. Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall
   select, at eir discretion, the number of VTs contained in each
   Layer, such that the total number of VTs in the Parcel is no
   less than five. 

   The contents of each layer shall be written down by the 
   Contestmaster, and encrypted using a Public Key Encryption
   algorithm. The encrypted message, and the public encryption key
   shall be sent to all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster
   shall not reveal the contents of each Layer until that Layer 
   is opened. 

5. The Music Pauses

   The Music shall pause four times, at times selected by the 
   Contestmaster. These times shall lie between 00:00 (GMT) July 13, 
   and 23:59 (GMT) on July 19.

   Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall write down these
   four times, encrypt them using a Public Key Encryption algorithm, 
   and send the encrypted message, and the public encryption key to
   all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster shall not reveal
   these times to any Player until after they have passed.

   When the Music pauses, a Layer of the Parcel shall be opened,
   and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before the Player
   who currently holds it, shall receive the contents of that Layer.

6. The Music Stops

   The Music stops at 00:00 (GMT) Monday July 20.
   
   At this time the fifth and final Layer of the Parcel shall be
   opened, and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before 
   the Player who currently holds it, shall receive the contents 
   of that Layer.

7. Passing the Parcel

   As soon as possible after the Music begins, the Contestmaster
   shall Pass the Parcel to the first Contestant on the Seating List.

   Thereafter, the Contestant who hold the Parcel shall pass it to 
   the next Contestant on the List, with the last Contestant on the
   List passing to the first Contestant on the List.

   If a Contestant passes the Parcel to any other Contestant, other
   than as proscribed above, then e shall leave the Contest.

   If a Contestant holds the Parcel for more than twelve hours 
   straight, e shall leave the Contest, and the Parcel shall 
   automatically be passed to the next Contestant on the List.

8. Currency Transfers

   All currency transfers required by these Regulations shall be 
   made by the Contestmaster as soon as possible after the 
   Contest has sufficient funds to do so.

9. Dissolving the Contest

   After the Music has stopped, and all required Currency Transfers
   have been made, the Contestmaster shall dissolve the Contest.
   Any currencies remaining in the Contest Treasury at this time 
   shall be transferred to the Contestmaster.
