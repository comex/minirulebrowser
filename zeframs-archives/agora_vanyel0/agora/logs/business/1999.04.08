This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends after the 
line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Organizational Reform" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) When a Judge Orders that an action be Rescinded, that action
          is considered to have never taken place, and all legal
          consequences of that action are nullified to the extent it
          is possible to do so.

      (b) A Judge shall Order an action Rescinded only when
          specifically authorized to do so by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1528 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization is a collective entity created by or
          recognized by these Rules.

      (b) Only those collective entities which these rules have
          created or recognized are Organizations.

      (c) Each Organization must have:
        (1) a Name, unique from that of every other Organization;
        (2) an Agent; and
        (3) a Charter.
          Any Organization which ceases to have each of the items
          listed above is subject to administrative dissolution, as
          defined elsewhere.  No Organization shall be created or
          recognized which does not have each of the items listed
          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) In a conflict between the Bylaws and the Charter of an
          Organization, the Charter takes precedence.

      (b) In a conflict between the Bylaws or the Charter of an
          Organization and the Rules, the Rules take precedence.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1614 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the
          Notary, which must set forth the Organization's old and new
          names.  The new name must be distinct from that of every
          other existing Organization.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Name may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1612 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Charter to the
          Notary.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter shall set forth
          its current name and its new Charter.

      (c) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter may be
          rescinded by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue
          when the Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and
          Bylaws of the Organization in question.

      (d) In any CFJ alleging that the Charter of an Organization has
          been changed improperly, the Judge shall consider the
          Charter as it existed prior to the Change.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1531 be amended to read:

      (a) The Agent of an Organization must be a natural person.

      (b) The Agent of an Organization is required to abide by the
          Charter and Bylaws (if any) of that Organization.

      (c) An Organization's Executor is its Agent, if its Agent is a
          Player; otherwise, it has no Executor.

      (d) An Organization's Agent shall only be changed by
        (1) the delivery, by its current Agent, of a Notice of Change
            of Organizational Agent to the Notary, setting forth the
            current name of the Organization and its new Agent;
        (2) by the Notary, Without Objection; or
        (3) by Judicial Order, when the Rules permit such an Order to
            issue.

      (e) No person shall be made the Agent of an Organization without

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the

          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.
