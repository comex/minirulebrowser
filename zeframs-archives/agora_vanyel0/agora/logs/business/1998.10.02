Hi all,

Here is the first round of the Moo Builders' Contest. It's a bit of a
slow start, but at least it is a test run.

In the next two weeks you (all Agorans, not just members of the
contest) can vote (send votes to me) for your favourite candidate for
best room - of those submitted in September.

I admit that the choice for this contest is somewhat limited ;) - if
you think that's silly, why don't you send a submission for the
November MBC together with your vote? Thanks for your attention.

Here is the submission:

For best room: The Underground System (as a whole), by lee.

For best object: no submission.

In two weeks' time I'll announce the winner, who will then get a prize
of 1.5 VTs.

Kolja A.
