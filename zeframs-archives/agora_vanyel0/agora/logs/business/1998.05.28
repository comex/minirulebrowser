H. Assessor, 

I hereby vote as follows:

   3  3  3  3  3  3
   7  7  7  7  7  7
   4  5  5  5  5  5

   *  F     *  F  

I am also curious to hear why Crito and Steve didn't even declare
presence on 3753 - while you may not be terribly keen on playing with
plots, broken plots seem even less desirable to me. On the other hand,
working plots, with paperwork reduced by Blobs recently protoed
improvements, will give the unemployed access to more than just a
small amount of social aid (and, together with my "no plots for
officers" proposal, even the opportunity to get similar incomes as
officers, with much less work involved). Let's give the people the
means to support themselves, instead of making them dependent on state
subsidies!
