'Abandonment' is just a name given to Speaker Silence. The Speaker, like
every other Player, has two weeks to respond to the allegation that e is
Quiet. All e has to do is post a message to the Public Forum, and e ceases
to be Quiet and becomes Noisy again.

A demonstration: Speaker Morendil is hereby made Quiet.

Swann isn't in Probate, but still had an EiP.  However, as Notary, and
according to Rule 1757, I hereby announce that General Chaos is no longer
Trustee of Swann, or of Swann's Estate.

I'm not sure whether Morendil is in Probate.  E is eir own Trustee,
however.  Supposing e carries out the steps that, if e is in Probate,
terminates eir Probate; and if e is not in Probate, is simply a series
of Transfer Orders executed of eir own volition.  Would that work?

Proto:  Plots (v2.2)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
     by the Bank.

     Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
     Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
     Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

       * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
       * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude and Longitude for "XY") is
created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Being the only entity other than the Bank to own Plots is a Winning
     Condition known as a Win by Ownership.  A Player may also Win in this way
     by being the Executor of such an entity.

     When a Player Wins in this way, all Plots Owned by the entity in question
     become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
     initially owned by the Bank.

     Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  An
     unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
     Cartographor, if the Plot's owner consents, and if no other Structure is
     assigned to that Plot.  An assigned Structure's owner may make it
     unassigned by informing the Cartographor.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

     Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Structures, and 15 Ergs.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a new Rule with this text:

     As soon as possible after this Rule is created, the Assessor shall pay out
     5 Mules and 15 Ergs to each person who was a Player when this Rule was
     created.  Upon the Assessor's doing so, this Rule shall repeal itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

     All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
     unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

     An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
     Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank.

     As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
     shall pay half the old Type's price (rounded down) to the Structure's
     owner.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

     Each Structure has a Maintenance Fee that becomes due at the beginning of
     each month.  When due, the Maintenance Fee for a Structure is paid when an
     entity successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of that
     Structure's Maintenance Fee, provided that e indicates clearly that the
     Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Maintenance Fee for that
     Structure.

     For each Structure whose Maintenance Fee remains unpaid one week after it
     becomes due, the Cartographor shall as soon as possible transfer that
     Structure to the Bank.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay out each
     Structure's Production (if any) to the owner of the Plot to which it is
     assigned.

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered to be two
     players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and any
     Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead given to
     its owner.

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

     A type of Working Mule exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Working Mule exist, with the specified prices,
     Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

       Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
       ----------------------------------------------------
       Idle         none       none         none
       Farm         4 Ergs     5 VTs        1 Erg
       Ranch        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
       Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
       Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

     Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
     Plots.

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each Church to which it
     is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Ranch or Mine to which
     it is Adjacent.

     A Ranch's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is not affected by Adjacency.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
       * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
       * the ownership of all Ergs
       * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
       * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
           the last Report
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
           Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 to read:

     At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.  This status
     shall not be changed except as specified in the Rules.

     When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

     An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e says so in the Public Forum.

     An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e says so in the Public Forum;
     however, any attempt to do so within 96 hours after e last went On Hold is
     ineffective.

Amend Rule 1664 by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
     has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711.

Oh well, it shows that I've finally found out how to subscribe.

Bye for Now
