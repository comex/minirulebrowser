I feel that all crimes due to the state of the Office of Accountor
after Blobs tenure and the subsequent difficulties in recovering the
records were inadvertent and deserve leniency.

I hereby submit to all Players an Application for Tolerance.  All who
sign this Application agree not to report any crimes that occurred
directly or indirectly between the dates of August 01 1998 and
September 09 1998, as a result in the delay in the Accountor's reports
for August of 1998 and the first week of September of 1998.  This
includes not reporting crimes for for Persistent Indebtedness or
tardiness in relationship to any PO's included in the report.

I , Player lee, hereby submit and sign this application.

Two things:

1)  This is not a legal type of Application, and will have no effect - it 
cannot even be executed since there is no Player for it to be submitted
to.
2)  Those are Infractions, not Crimes.

Nevertheless, I agree to the spirit of this, in the sense of Rule 1742,
which seems the appropriate way to do something like this.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
