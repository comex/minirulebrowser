My last proto to empower the Ambassador was not so popular, so let's
try something a little milder:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROTO: Empower the Ambassador 2

Amend Rule 1632 ("InterNomic Voting Procedure") by replacing the text:

      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then Agora shall abstain from voting on that
      Proposal.
with:
      The InterNomic Vote shall be FOR if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has passed and AGAINST if the Referendum on that
      Proposal has failed. If the Referendum on that Proposal is
      undecided, then the Ambassador may choose how Agora is to
      vote, at eir own discretion.
