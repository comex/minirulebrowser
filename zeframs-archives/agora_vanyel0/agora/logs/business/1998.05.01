Unsubscribe

I've deleted the 'how to unsubscribe' message, so if this doesn't do it,
please remind me.

Oh, and have fun with my probate (it's pretty easy - no debts).

It's been fun, but I haven't had the time recently. Maybe later.

Well, barring psychic software it might be even better to "subscribe
internomic".

Some advice Jester:  Never try to cancel a newspaper subscription - with
your methods, you'll only get yourself on the front page.

And don't even _think_ about cancelling cable service.

The correct address for unsubscriptions is usually
<listname>-request@<wherever the list is>.

It didn't work for discussion and business, at least.  I guess Steve can
do it for you.

I hereby make Jester Quiet.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
