Apparently I've just gotten 9 Indulgences from Chuck, so:

I transfer 2, 2, 1, 1, and 1 Indulgences to the Bank to satisfy POI879,
POI911, POI942, POI945, and POI950, respectively.

It doesn't look as if you did.  This was becase you as Speaker
announced that you'd won the Election.  Normally, as I get to do that
I both announce and it and order the increase in the score.  Anyway...

I hereby order the Scorekeepor to note the Steve has gained five
points for winning the Cartographor election. 

Michael.
