     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 43, ISSUE 4
     Saturday edition
     April 11, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

3/30  Harlequin protoes "Electees".

3/31  Steve Proposes "Tabula Rasa" and protoes "Variable Batch Sizes".

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1706 (Locations),
        along with the rest of the Agoraverse Rules.

      The following Proposals are distributed:
        3720 [Steve]    Tweak R833 
        3721 [Steve]    Encourage VT spending 
        3722 [Kolja A.] Reward for Trustees 
        3723 [Sherlock] Sherlock #1.3
        3724 [Chuck]    Repeal "Discourages Too Many Proposals"

      Kolja A. protoes "Encourage P-note spending".

      Morendil protoes "More fun with Priority".

4/1   Steve Proposes "No Quorum Tools" and re-protoes "Variable Batch
        Sizes".

4/2   These Proposals have been adopted:
        3718 [Steve] Indelible Proposal voting
        3719 [Swann] A minor Score Fix

      Murphy Proposes "Plots".

4/3   Harlequin re-protoes and later Proposes "Electees".  E then
        attempts to remove it from the Proposal Queue.  Since there is
        currently no provision for Proposals removed from the Queue to
        re-enter it, this may be disallowed by Rule 106's requirement
        that all Proposals be voted on.  [See CFJ 1091.]

4/6   These Proposals are distributed:
        3725 [Steve]          Tabula Rasa
        3726 [Steve]          No Quorum Tools
        3727 [Kolja A.]       B.N. for Kolja A.
        3728 [Repeal-O-Matic] Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)
        3729 [Kolja A.]       A Scoring nitpick 

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1568 [Judges On
        Hold].  Promotor Crito adds an amendment to Rule 1567 to the
        Proposal, for consistency.

4/7   Steve Proposes "Variable Batch Sizes".

      Crito protoes "Indelible Transfer Orders".
