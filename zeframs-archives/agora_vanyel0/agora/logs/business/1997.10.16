Proto-Proposal
What is a Judgement, or an Injunction?

[Comment: In the interests of making it clearer what is and is not
a legal Judgement (or Injunction), I propose the following
amendments. Dismissal now counts as a Judgement, which seemed the
simplest of the alternatives I considered.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 591 be amended by replacing the text
in it which currently reads:

      A Judge returns a Judgement by sending it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A Judgement must be either TRUE or FALSE, and must be
      delivered to the Clerk not later than the end of the permitted
      time for deliberation.  A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

with text which reads:

      A document is a Judgement of a CFJ if and only if it is clearly
      marked as a Judgement of that CFJ, if it contains a clear
      indication either that the Statement of the CFJ is TRUE or that
      it is FALSE, or that the CFJ is dismissed, and it has been
      submitted to the Clerk of the Courts not later than the end of
      the permitted time for deliberation by the duly authorized
      Judge of that CFJ.

Be it further resolved that R1565 be amended to read:

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one or more of the following is
      true of it:

        i) It contains no clearly identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) It was not made in accordance with the Rules.
        v) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      A dismissal is legal only if it is made for one or more of the
      reasons listed above, and the Judge must accompany a Judgement
      to dismiss a CFJ with a list of the reasons, taken from those
      above, that the CFJ is being dismissed. Failure to do so is
      grounds for the CotC to refuse to accept the Judgement to dismiss
      the CFJ as having been legally made; if the CotC does accept and
      distribute the Judgement, the absence of such reasons is grounds
      for a Board of Appeal to set aside the dismissal in the event the
      Judgement is appealed.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1
      Voting Token.

Be it further resolved that R663 be amended by replacing the text in
which currently reads:

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

with text which reads:

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions. Such an order is called an Injunction. Anything
      clearly marked as an Injunction, and which is made by a duly
      authorized Judge attached to the Judgement of a CFJ, shall be
      treated prima facie as an Injunction, although it may later be
      determined that the Injunction was illegally made, or had no
      effect, or both.

Thank you very much to Andre and Steve for some balancing
redistribution of VTs. Not that the situation we have is completely
undesirable - it may be seen as an (unwanted) step towards a realistic
economy to have some rich and some poor players, but I appreciate very
much the chance to vote on more than just one measly proposal.

As a thank you for Andre, who started this, (H. Herald, take note) I
would like to transfer one Kudo from - - - oh, I notice that before
starting this message I intended to have Andre both as a recipient and
as a victim of a Kudo transfer. So I'll risk looking a bit silly, but
try again:

H. Herald, take note:

I transfer one Kudo from Andre, for repeatedly ignoring my requests
for ineligibility to judge, my coming off hold and, more recently,
even my existence (sniff...) in many recent CFJ assignments, to Steve
for eir contribution to game balance by spreading some VTs.

I also transfer one Kudo from me, for lack of a better victim, to
Andre, for starting this voluntary VT distribution business.

In addition I have transferred a Koljenka each to Steve and Andre.

I would also like to have a few more VTs. So if you have any left,
make me an offer. I could pay, e.g., two Koljenkas for one VT to get
dome Kjs in circulation.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1055

"Some or all of the Payment Orders issued by CotC Andre in a message
posted on or about Oct. 11, titled "OFF: Salaries & Infractions",
were illegally issued, as the number of Infractions allegedly
committed by Judge Morendil in issuing Injunctions in eir Judgement
of CFJ 1045 did not exceed 4, the number of Injunctions therein
issued."

======================================================================

The heart of this judgement clearly lies in counting the number of
Injunctions made by Morendil in CFJ 1045.  Let us do that.

Let us begin by looking at Morendil's first sentence/paragraph containing
at least one Injunction:

---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

There are a few things to consider when trying to determine how many
Injunctions lie in this sentence.  First of all, the word "injunctions" is
used in its plural form.  This implies that there's more than one.
Morendil follows this word, however, with the phrase "applying to all
current Officers".  Therefore, he is making the statement "I hereby issue
Injunctions ..., applying to all current Officers, requiring them ... [to
issue one PO from the Bank to each player]"  Was the word "Injunctions"
used to imply there are more than one, or was it used to imply that there
were more than one Order?

Rule 663 states (in part):

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, the phrases "applying to all current Officers" states the target
of the Injunction(s), and the phrase "requiring them ..." to the end of the
sentence states what the targets are required to perform.  Nowhere in the
sentence/paragraph are further "injunctions" defined.  The first paragraph
therefore contains one injunction.

The second sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can be analyzed exactly as above.  It, also,
contains only one injunction.

The third sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can also be analyzed exactly as above.  It
therefore contains only one injunction.

The last sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)
---

This sentence/paragraph is exactly like the above, only it applies only to
the Registrar, and not all current Officers.

Counting up the total injunctions, I see only four.

The CFJ states that some or all of Andre's PO's of Oct 11 were issued
illegally, as there were no more than four injunctions.

I hereby find CFJ 1055 to be TRUE.

I hereby, as described and permitted by Rule 663, issue an Injunction
applying to Andre requiring em to vacate the Payment Orders POI101 through
POI124, inclusive.

I've fixed the bug Crito pointed out.

####
Proto-Proposal
Majority Appeal decisions

[Comment: in a couple of CFJs recently, we have seen a majority of
the Justices agree to overturn a decision - only to have the CFJ
then reassigned because of the way R1693 is worded. I propose to
fix this problem. In general, I have tried to make clearer the
relationship between the rulings of individual Justices and the
Board's ruling.]]

Be it hereby resolved that R1693 be amended to read:

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices 
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but a majority of the Justices do not agree
      on what action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as
      above.

How could the use of the plural form 'Injunctions' possibly be used
to indicate that there was more than Order? As you yourself point out,
R663 allows a single Injunction to require the issuing of more than
one Order. Morendil could have issued a single Injunction applying to
all the Officers, requiring them make multiple POs. All he needed to
have to have done was to say:

      I hereby issue an Injunction, applying to each current Officer,
      requiring them issue Payment Orders of such-and-such a kind.

But that's not what he did. Your first observation was the correct one:
the fact that Morendil used the plural form 'Injunctions' must be taken
to indicate that there is one Injunction for each current Officer who
meets the description.

>The last sentence/paragraph reads:

The last paragraph is distinctly *not* like the other three, in that
it does not use the construction "for each ucrrent Officer".

"...Injunctions, applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue,
for each Player..." is very clearly one Injunction for each Player.

I don't see how you can possibly read this as only one Injunction.

In light of these errors, I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1055.
