This is an Application to Create an Organisation.

In order to celebrate the occasion of Agora's fifth Birthday, there 
shall exist a Contest called "Pass the Parcel", with Blob as the 
Contestmaster.

The Regulations of the Contest are as follows:

1. The Music

   Any player may become a Contestant by informing the Contestmaster
   that e wishes to do so, provided that this is done before mindight
   GMT on the morning of July 29. At that time, the Music shall begin.

   After the Music has begun, no more Contestants will be accepted. 
   A Contestant may leave the contest at any time, by informing the
   Contestmaster that e wishes to do so. Contestants may also be
   required to leave the Contest, as the Regulations dictate.

2. The Parcel

   There exists an entity called "The Parcel" which is at any given
   moment in time, held by one Player. Initially the Parcel is held
   by the Contestmaster. The Player holding the Parcel may pass it
   to another Contestant, by posting a message to the Contestmaster
   and all Contestants stating that e does so. 

3. Seating Arrangements

   The Contestmaster shall keep an ordered list of all Contestants.
   This list is called the "Seating List", and shall be sent to
   all Contestants. After the Music begins, the Contestmaster may
   not change the Seating List, except to remove any Contestants
   who leave the Contest.

4. The Layers

   The Parcel has five Layers, each of which contains a certain 
   number of VTs. Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall
   select, at eir discretion, the number of VTs contained in each
   Layer, such that the total number of VTs in the Parcel is no
   less than five. 

   The contents of each layer shall be written down by the 
   Contestmaster, and encrypted using a Public Key Encryption
   algorithm. The encrypted message, and the public encryption key
   shall be sent to all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster
   shall not reveal the contents of each Layer until that Layer 
   is opened. 

5. The Music Pauses

   The Music shall pause four times, at times selected by the 
   Contestmaster. These times shall lie between midnight (GMT +1200) 
   on the morning of July 29, and 11:59 PM (GMT +1200) on July 30.

   Before the Music begins, the Contestmaster shall write down these
   four times, encrypt them using a Public Key Encryption algorithm, 
   and send the encrypted message, and the public encryption key to
   all Contestants. Otherwise, the Contestmaster shall not reveal
   these times to any Player until after they have passed.

   When the Music pauses, a Layer of the Parcel shall be opened,
   and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before the Player
   who currently holds it, shall receive the contents of that Layer.

6. The Music Stops

   The Music stops at midnight (GMT +1200) the night of Agora's 
   Birthday.
   
   At this time the fifth and final Layer of the Parcel shall be
   opened, and the Player who held the Parcel immediately before 
   the Player who currently holds it, shall receive the contents 
   of that Layer.

7. Passing the Parcel

   As soon as possible after the Music begins, the Contestmaster
   shall Pass the Parcel to the first Contestant on the Seating List.

   Thereafter, the Contestant who hold the Parcel shall pass it to 
   the next Contestant on the List, with the last Contestant on the
   List passing to the first Contestant on the List.

   If a Contestant passes the Parcel to any other Contestant, other
   than as proscribed above, then e shall leave the Contest.

   If a Contestant holds the Parcel for more than six hours straight,
   e shall leave the Contest, and the Parcel shall automatically be
   passed to the next Contestant on the List.

8. Currency Transfers

   All currency transfers required by these Regulations shall be 
   made by the Contestmaster as soon as possible after the 
   Contest has sufficient funds to do so.

9. Dissolving the Contest

   After the Music has stopped, and all required Currency Transfers
   have been made, the Contestmaster shall dissolve the Contest.
   Any currencies remaining in the Contest Treasury at this time 
   shall be transferred to the Contestmaster.

This Week with R-O-M

There are 353 Rules in the current Rule set.  This week's selections are:

268 = Rule 1845 Structures
272 = Rule 1850 Production of Structures
215 = Rule 1044 Unique Patent Titles
264 = Rule 1856 Adjacency
276 = Rule 1543 The Wizard

Hmm, seems the R-O-M has something against Plots.  8)  I don't think the
sentiment is shared by that many Players, however.  I'll go with Steve's
suggestion and select Rule 1543, although even if most Players think this is a
"white elephant", I don't think there's much incentive anymore to get rid of
them.  We'll see.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1543 (The Wizard)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1543 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1542 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1682 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1784 is amended by deleting the paragraph:
     "Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e
      shall gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change."

#####
PROTO-Proposal: Transfer Notices

[Section 1: The Framework]

Rename Rule 1598/7 (Power=1) ("Transfer Orders") "Transfer Notices" and
amend it to read:

      A Transfer Notice (TN) is a body of text which documents the
      transfer of ownership of one or more Nomic Entities from
      one entity (the "source") to another (the "recipient"). It 
      consists of text that unambiguously indicates that a transfer 
      is to take place and specifies any information required of a 
      Transfer Notice. 

      The transfer noted by a Transfer Notice takes place when a 
      valid TN is executed (sent to the Public Forum, or to the 
      Recordkeepor of an Entity), unless another Rule specifies
      another time for the transfer to take place. If the source
      Entity possesses an insufficient quantity of the Nomic
      Entity in question when the transfer is to occur, the
      transfer fails, and no Entities are transferred.

      A valid Transfer Notice specifies exactly one source 
      entity and exactly one recipient entity, and in addition to 
      any other specifications required by other Rules. 

      Each valid Transfer Notice must belong to exactly one class
      of Transfer Notices, as defined in other Rules.

Create a Rule entitled "Currency Transfer Notices" with the text:

      There exists a class of TN called "Currency Transfer Notices,"
      or CTNs. A CTN must specify a Currency of which units will be
      transferred, and a number of units of that Currency to be
      transferred, which must be a positive multiple of that
      Currency's MUQ. In addition, a CTN may only specify as its
      source the Player who executed the CTN, or an Entity whose
      Executor is the Player who executed the CTN, unless another
      Rule specifies otherwise.

      If a Currency Transfer Notice purports to satisfy a particular 
      Payment Order and either that Payment Order does not exist or 
      cannot be satisfied by the CTN, then the CTN is invalid.

Create a Rule entitled "Plot Transfer Notices" with the text:

      There exists a class of TN called "Plot Transfer Notices,"
      or PTNs. A Plot Transfer Notice must specify an individual
      Plot by name which is to be transferred. In addition, a
      PTN may only specify as its source the Player who executed
      the PTN, or an Entity whose Executor is the Player who
      executed the PTN. 

Rename Rule 1378 ("Kudo Transfers") "Kudo Transfer Notices" and amend it to
read:

      There exists a class of TN called "Kudo Transfer Notices,"
      or KTNs. A Kudo Transfer Notice must specify a justification
      for the transfer being made. In addition, the source and
      recipient of a KTN may not be the same.

      A player cannot execute a KTN if any of the following 
      conditions are true:

        a) The Player has executed two KTNs during the current
           Nomic Week.
        b) The source or recipient entity is not a Player.
        c) The recipient is the Player executing the KTN.
        d) The source is the same as the source of a KTN
           previously executed by the same Player during the
           current Nomic Week.
        e) The recipient is the same as the recipient of a KTN
           previously executed by the same Player during the
           current Nomic Week.

Rename Rule 1817 ("Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders")
"Recordkeepor's Obedience of Transfer Notices" and amend it to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Notices
      submitted by any Player, except for those which would result
      in an Entity possessing a negative quantity of the named Entity.
      Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in the
      order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

Repeal Rule 1818 ("Vacation of Transfer Orders").

Repeal Rule 1819 ("Effect of Transfer Orders").

Rename Rule 1820 ("Recording of Transfer Orders") "Recording of Transfer
Notices" and amend it to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Notices
      submitted which specify the Entity of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Rename Rule 1730 ("Delayed Transfer Orders") "Delayed Transfer Notices" and
amend it to read:

      Players may execute Transfer Notices which specify a time after
      the execution of the Transfer Notice for their transfer to occur. 
      Such Transfer Notices are known as Delayed Transfer Notices 
      (DTNs).

      The Recordkeepor of an Entity may, at eir discretion, refuse
      any Delayed Transfer Order, by notifying the Player who 
      executed the DTN within seven days of its execution, and
      before the Transfer is to occur. Refusing a DTN renders it
      invalid and prevents its transfer from taking place.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Noticess which are required 
      by a Rule to be DTNs.

[Section 2: Payment Order Fixes]

Amend Rule 1596 ("Payment Orders") to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      transfer units of a Currency from itself to some other entity  
      (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies exactly one source 
      entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one Currency, 
      and a number of units of that Currency which is a positive 
      multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Amend Rule 1823 ("Combining Payment Orders") by deleting the text the text
"or of a Transfer Order".

Amend Rule 1732 ("Satisfaction of Payment Orders") to read:

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Notice to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      Transfer Notice was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated
      that that Transfer Notice was being submitted for the purpose of
      satisfying the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given Transfer Notice may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

[Section 3: Rulekeepor Reform]

Rename Rule 1578 ("Currency Recordkeepors") "Recordkeepors" and amend it to
read:

      Any type or class of Nomic Entities defined in a Rule as a
      general type, rather than an individual, specific Nomic Entity,
      must have a Recordkeepor associated with it. The Recordkeepor
      of a class of Entities is required to maintain a record of all
      instances of that class of Entity and which other Entities
      possess them (if any).

      If the designated Recordkeepor of an Entity ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibilty until a new
      Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
      Recordkeepor, then all units of that class of Entity are 
      destroyed and the Entity ceases to exist.

Amend Rule 1062 ("Kudos and Honour") by appending the text:

      The Recordkeepor for Kudos is the Herald.

Amend Rule 1855 ("Plots") by appending the text:

      The Recordkeepor for Plots is the Cartographor.

Amend Rule 1845 ("Structures") by appending the text:

      The Recordkeepor for Structures is the Cartographor.

Amend Rule 1467 ("Definition of Currencies") by appending the text:

      The Recordkeepor for Currencies is the Chancellor.

Rename Rule 1738 ("Executors in Probate") "Trustees".

[Section 4: Other Cleanup]

Amend Rule 1757 ("Implementation of Probate Plans") by replacing the text:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  

with the text:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
      whatever Transfer Notices with that entity as the source entity
      are neccesary to implement eir Plan for the disposition of that
      entity's Estate. 

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by replacing the text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with the text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      execute Delayed Transfer Notices to take effect at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

and the text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;


with the text:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
