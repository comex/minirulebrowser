In the matter of CFJ 1058, I find the Statement to be FALSE.

There is yet considerable doubt in my mind as to the proper number of
Infractions which should have been imposed against Morendil for his
recent flagrant abuse of judicial power.  However, the penalty imposed
by an Infraction is binding whether or not imposed properly, and it is
clear that Andre, as Clerk of the Courts, did impose sufficient
penalties to give Morendil in excess of 30 Blots.  Whether Andre did
so properly need not be addressed in the instant matter; propriety is
simply not an issue.  To the best of my understanding, Morendil did
indeed have at least 31 Blots at the time of elJefe's allegation, and
thus elJefe's allegation is correct, and no Crime was committed.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.

I have not made any Proposals lately - even if we extend lately quite far
the number is low. Here are some, to cure that at least partly. All these 
Proposals are Disinterested. In case I have not made myself clear:
The text below consists of five Proposals (Promotor, take note).

======================================================================

Proposal
Repeal Pitchfork

Let Rule 1675 (Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers) be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
Remove Silliness
Let Rules 1650 (The Silly Person) and 1651 (The Silly Proposal) be
repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
InterNomic Proposal cleanup

Amend Rule 1633 (InterNomic Proposals) to read:

      Players are permitted to submit InterNomic Proposals, which are
      distinct from Proposals in Agora, by sending to the Ambassador
      a text which is clearly intended to become an InterNomic
      Proposal. If a Player does so, the Ambassador shall be required
      to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance
      to InterNomic procedures.

      In no case shall such submission, or the distribution by the
      Ambassador of text clearly labeled as InterNomic Proposals cause
      the Proposing of Proposals in Agora, any Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------

Explanation:
Removes the restriction to one IN Proposal per Player per week,
disinfects the Rule (it still contained the old Virus sentence!),
and improved the wording.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
Shorten InterNomic Voting Period

Amend Rule 1632 (InterNomic Voting Procedure) by replacing the phrase

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until one week before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

by:

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until 72 hours before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

----------------------------------------

Explanation:
Avoids short (if the Ambassador happens to be slow) or even negative
(if the Ambassador happens to be Tardy) Voting Periods.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal
Liaison? Which Liaison?

Amend Rule 1634 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's"
Amend Rule 1631 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's" in all
its concurrences.

A slightly stronger statement seems needed.
Here is my new Voting Policy for the time being:

I will not support any Proposal which was not Proto-Proposed, with
occasional exceptions for
1) Proposals that benefit from secrecy until it is Proposed (i.e. certain
Scams, or humor.)
2) Proposals that _have_ to be Proposed at great speed.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
