    or any Contestant.

2.  The entry fee is 1 VT.

3.  A prediction for a Proposal is valid if it is submitted by a Contestant

    rejected".

4.  At the end of a Proposal's Voting Period, each Contestant who made a
    correct prediction for that Proposal gains one Seal.

6.  A Contestant may cease to be a Contestant by informing the Contestmaster
    of eir desire to do so, but loses all eir Seals by doing so.

outstanding were in fact vacated when the at-that-time Treasuror Crito
implemented eir budget on 14 January:

> 39          10Dec98 01:48:43     1 lee             The Bank      Blob
