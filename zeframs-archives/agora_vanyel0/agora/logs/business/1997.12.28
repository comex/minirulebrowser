H. Promotor Crito!

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying the Petition Fee to do so.

####
Proposal
Bring Back Public Voting

[Comment: the Public Voting Experiment seems to have been popular,
but the renumbering of the Rule which brought it into being means
that it will end on Dec 23, since P3634 no longer amends the correct
Rule. I propose to bring it back quickly.]

[Comment: P3651 has the same problem as P3634, I've incorporated its
amendment into the proto.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Public Voting", be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.
