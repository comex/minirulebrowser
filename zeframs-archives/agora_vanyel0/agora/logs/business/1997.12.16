     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 42, ISSUE 11
     Monday edition
     December 15, 1997


PROPOSALS
---------

12/08  InterNomic Proposal 353 [Ackanomic]
         "Amend Rule 215 to replace the word 'Rishonnomic' with the
          word 'Rishonomic.'"
       INP 354 [Thring]
         Add a customized amendment mechanism to Rule 215.
       INP 355 [New Rishonomic]
         Create PlayNomic as a non-voting member of InterNomic.

12/09  Proposal 3633 [Chuck]    Repeal Rule Attributions
       Proposal 3634 [Steve]    Permanent Public Voting
       Proposal 3635 [G. Chaos] Simplify Judicial Salaries
       Proposal 3636 [G. Chaos] Probate, Take Two
       Proposal 3637 [Blob]     Perpetual Offices
       Proposal 3638 [Michael]  Repeal the Virus

       Assessor General Chaos reports that Proposals 3537, 3538, 3543,
         and 3601-3612 - all thought to have failed because the Voting
         mechanism was broken at the time - actually passed, because
         the Voting mechanism wasn't completely broken.  (But 3603
         failed because non-Frankenstein Monsters can't Vote.)

12/09  Harlequin submits an Insane Proposal ("FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY")
         with typical "Harlequin Wins when this Rule is created, etc."
         type text.  Harlequin may indeed get a Win by Insanity from
         it, as the combination of the Insanity Rule and the Public
         Voting Experiment appear to forbid any Voting on it.  (But see
         CFJ 1075; the Insanity Rule's ban on discussion may be
         ineffective.  Also, General Chaos disputes the effectiveness
         of the Insanity Rule's "this rule has been bended".)

12/10  General Chaos re-protoes "Lowered Quorum",  "Liberalize
         Speaker's Patronage", and "No Double Penalties for Officers".

       Kolja A. Proposes liberalizing the Repeal-O-Matic Rule.

       Harlequin pays the Petition Fee for "FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY",
         making it Interested and thus Insane.

12/11  INP 352 is adopted, making Bluesmobile Nomic a voting member of
         InterNomic.

       elJefe re-protoes "Late Judgements".

       General Chaos protoes "Loophole Avoidance", which would disable
         the Public Voting Experiment whenever it would prohibit all
         Voting on a Proposal.

12/12  Chuck argues that Restore Game Balance II and A Public Voting
         Experiment both created Rules numbered 1741, and protoes a
         pragmatization of Rule 1349.

12/13  Proposal 3639 [Harlequin] Infect Rule 1605
                                   ("Discourages Too Many Proposals")
       Proposal 3640 [Harlequin] FULL FRONTAL LOBOTOMY
       Proposal 3641 [Kolja A.]  <no title>
                                   (Amendment to Repeal-O-Matic Rule)


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1073 [Steve]
         12/08 Assigned to Swann
         "Votes were cast on Proposals 3601-3613."

CFJ 1074 [Michael]
         12/10 Assigned to elJefe
         "A Proposer of a Disinterested Proposal is not liable for a 1
          P-note fee if their proposal fails."

CFJ 1075 [Steve]
         12/12 Assigned to Oerjan
         "Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with lower
          precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
          purely discussionary nature."


OFFICES
-------

12/09  Michael Nominates for Cartographor.

12/10  Murphy attempts to Nominate for Cartographor, but is not quite
         two hours late.

12/12  Michael is Elected Cartographor by Acclamation.

       No Nominees for Archivist, so another Election begins.

12/14  General Chaos resigns as Assessor.


OTHER
-----

12/14  Oerjan recalculates the Frankenstein Rule's status and finds
         that the restriction of Voting to Frankenstein Monsters was
         never effective after all, meaning that Proposal 3603 passed
         after all.  A sentence requiring Votes to be sent to the
         Frankenstein Monster is added to the Frankenstein Rule (but
         the Public Voting Experiment probably has it covered anyway).


ERRATA
------

Proposals 3537, 3538, 3543, and 3601-3613 actually passed.  [General
  Chaos, Steve]

I think there are Frankenstein Monsters subscribed to the Public Forum, so
the provision in the Frankenstein Rule should not have much effect.

I could not find a Proto for Rule 3646, so no vote there.

Email me if you lack any of the Official REPORTS I have made (alas, I have
not yet found RECORDS of HISTORICAL mutations.) I will soon post the
MUTATION Report for this Week.

As the Currency holdings (especially VTs) around here are still rather
uncertain, I do not feel that I can fulfil my EinP duties for Calabresi
before going on holiday.  I therefore resign as such.

I judge TRUE.

I agree with the Caller that the second part of the cited sentence must be
considered on its own behalf.

I also do not find anything else in Rule 1023 that contradicts this. 
There are deferrence clauses, but those would merely reduce the Rule's
precedence and so are not of concern to the Statement.

(I do not think they trigger in the case of Rule 1729, anyhow.)

Still, I deny the requested Injunction.  This I do because Rule 1729,
while the immediate reason for the interest in this issue, is not actually
relevant to its resolution.  The statement would be just as true if 1729
did not exist.


Rule 1023/9 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      the Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

After this, I make myself Ineligible to Judge any CFJs called between now

I hereby pay the Petition Fee for the following Proposal.


Proposal:  Declaration of Absence

Amend Rule 1715 to read:

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT or ABSENT on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to
      the Vote Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      Players who declare themselves ABSENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum are not considered to have voted, unless they
      also do something else that causes em to be so considered.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

Amend Rule 452 by replacing the paragraph beginning "This Rule shall in
no way prohibit the Vote Collector" with this paragraph:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared Presence
      or Absence on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum.  If a
      Voting Entity has performed one of these actions in the Public
      Forum and has not performed any of these actions outside the
      Public Forum, then the Vote Collector is permitted to state that
      that Voting Entity has performed that action.  Otherwise, the Vote
      Collector is prohibited from specifying which of these actions
      a Voting Entity has performed.  The publication of a list as
      described in this Rule is not a Crime, unless specified as such
      by another Rule.

Amend Rule 683 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1717 by replacing this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with this paragraph:

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.  If
      any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a Proposal
      by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, then both their Votes on
      that Proposal and any delayed Transfer Orders generated by those
      Votes are cancelled.

Amend Rule 1434 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST".

Amend Rule 1663 by replacing "FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN" with "FOR and
AGAINST".
