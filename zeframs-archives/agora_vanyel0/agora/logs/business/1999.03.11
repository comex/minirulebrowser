This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Powers of Attorney" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rules 1841 and 1842 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Player (hereinafter, the Grantee) who lawfully holds a
          grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
          the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of
          Attorney. However, this power to act on the Grantor's behalf
          shall not extend to the performance of any privilege, duty,
          or power of any Office held by the Grantee.

      (b) Power of Attorney is granted by Public Forum Announcement. 
          The announcement shall be posted by the Grantor and shall
          set forth:
        (1) the name of the Grantee; and
        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of
            the announcement;
        (3) the grant is to begin within one week of the time of the
            announcement;
        (4) the grant is to end within three months of the time of the
            announcement;
        (5) the Grantee holds a grant of Power of Attorney for at most
            one other Player at the time of the announcement; and
        (6) the Grantee has not granted Power of Attorney to anyone
            else.

      (d) A grant is terminated if:
        (1) the Grantee ceases to be a Player or goes on Hold;
        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum
            Announcement, to the grant before the time the grant
            begins;
        (4) the grant's specified period expires;
        (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
        (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum
            Announcement.

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
          duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
          and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
          who holds any of these positions.

Completing the process for this appeal seems a bit tricky to me.  It's not
clear to me what it actually means to vacate an order to vacate a PO which
was already satisfied.  We've had a previous discussion on whether vacating
an order does anything to reverse collateral (secondary) effects of an order
that have occurred prior to the vacation.  IIRC, we decided that it could not
(and that is my opinion, as well).  This means that vacating the vacation of
a satisfied PO would have no affect on the condition of the PO, i.e. it would
continue to be satisfied.  One might argue that since such a vacate order
caused a reversal PO to be issued,  the reversal PO is also vacated.  But
this reversal PO is only a collateral effect of the original vacation, and
IMO, the reversal PO would not be automatically vacated.

However, I think R1807 gives me an out:

Rule 1807/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Appellate Orders

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        ...

So, with the consent of one or more of my fellow justices, I issue
the following Appellate Orders to Steve in eir Official capacity
as Clerk of the Courts:

1)  The CotC is hereby commanded to issue a Payment Order for 1 VT
    naming Kolja as the Payor and the Bank as Payee.
2)  The CotC is hereby commanded to issue a Payment Order for 1 Indulgence
    naming Kolja as the Payor and the Bank as Payee.

These orders will have the effect of reinstating the Failure to Vote
penalties which should apply to Kolja based on this Appeal.

Proposal: Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined 
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be 
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for 
          collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
          This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction. 
          On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir 
          Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one 
          particular currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction 
          Currency is the Voting Token.

      (d) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first 
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public Forum, 
          together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction 
          Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      (e) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
          is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (f) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
          Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that 
          particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is 
          only valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

        (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, 
            or after its end.
        (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the 
            Auction Currency.
        (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
        (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made so 
            far in the Auction.

      (g) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
          without a valid Bid having been made.

      (h) The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
          largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The 
          Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
          as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
          a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
          equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to become a Zombie by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E then becomes
      a Zombie. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the Player has become a Zombie.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Change the title of Rule 1042 to "Zombification due to Silence".
 
Create a rule, with titled "Zombie Masters", with text:

      All Players who are Zombies have a Master, who owns them. 
      When a Player first becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the 
      Bank. Zombies may only be transferred from one Master to
      another as explicitly described by the rules.

      If a Player becomes a Zombie's Master, then e is granted
      Power of Attorney for the Zombie, for as long as e remains
      the Zombie's Master. Non-player Zombie Masters are not
      granted Power of Attorney in this way.

      If a Player who owns a Zombie deregisters, all eir Zombies
      become owned by the Bank. The Registrar is required to
      announce this transfer as soon as possible after the
      Player's deregistration, and the transfer takes effect at
      the time it is announced.

      The Registrar is required to keep track of which Players
      are Zombies, and who their Masters are, and publish this
      information in eir Report.

Create a rule, with title "Zombie Auctions", and text:

      Each week, if there are any Zombies owned by the Bank, for
      which Auctions are not already underway, the Registrar 
      shall conduct an Auction for each of those Zombies. The
      Auctioneer for these Auctions shall be the Registrar. The
      Auction Currency is Indulgences, and the Starting Price 
      for each Auction is equal to the number of Blots held by 
      the Zombie being Auctioned, with a minimum value of one.

      When the Winner of the Auction is announced, e becomes 
      the Zombie's new Master. If the Auction ends without a
      winner, then the Zombie is deregistered.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the 
      Registrar shall vacate any Blots that owned by the 
      Zombie.

Create a rule, with title "Returning to Life", and text:

      If a Zombie Player becomes Noisy, then e is no longer
      a Zombie, and eir Master ceases to own em. 

      Unless the Zombie was owned by the Bank, the Registrar
      shall pay the Zombie's most recent Master a number of
      indulgences equal to the starting price in that Zombie's
      most recent Auction, halved for each new calendar month
      since the end of the Auction. This payment shall be 
      made as soon as possible after the Zombie becomes Noisy.

Amend Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsiblilities) to read:

      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or executor in probate, or in 
      general to occupy any role or position to which a Rule assigns
      any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered, or who is
      a Zombie, may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes
      precedence over rules which would prevent em from ceasing to
      occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

Amend Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal From Offices) by replacing the
text:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered,
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

with:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, is deregistered, or
      becomes a Zombie, e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

[Comments:

1.0 - Old Nomickers don't die...

      Silent players are no longer deregistered, but become Zombies.
      Zombies are initially owned by the bank, but are Auctioned off
      for Indulgences (which effectively go towards paying off that
      Zombie's Blots).
 
      The player who so buys a Zombie, gains its Power of Attorney.
      If the Zombie player returns to the game, its Master is 
      refunded some of eir price.

      ...the just get amended.

1.1 - If a Zombie is not bought, it is deregistered, to prevent lots
      of unwanted Zombies from being Auctioned every week.

      Fixed a bug in the refund rule (forgot to say who was being paid).

      Zombies cannot become Officers, Judges, etc.
