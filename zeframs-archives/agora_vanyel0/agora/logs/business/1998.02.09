I vote AGAINST, for reasons listed in the last vote on .Nomic (also, I
could be wrong, but isn't the correct name of the game .nomic?).

There should be a space after that first comma, so I vote AGAINST on
this one, too.

PROTO SC-1
Spring Cleaning

[Corrections of various errors found during Read the Ruleset Week, and
a few found while preparing this Proto.

I have not included capitalization in this, although it is a mess.
That may be a separate Proto.

I also did not try to standardize between "a SLC" and "an SLC".
I _did_ include corrections of "he/his" to "e/eir".

I have divided the Proto into "Basic grammar and spelling", which
should be fairly uncontroversial changes, and "Various", which may or
may not be so.

I'll check what AI this needs at a later stage.]

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

[The last remains of the Virus.  Does anyone want to keep this?]

Rule 1659 ("The Right to call Elections") is amended to read

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right to call Elections.
      This Right is exercised by posting an announcement in the Public
      Forum that both lists a number of Offices currently held in
      normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker is exercising eir
      Right to call these Elections.  If the Speaker posts such a
      message, is not Tainted at the time of posting, and has not
      exercised this Right since e last became Speaker, all Officers
      holding Offices listed in this post are then retired from those
      Offices.

[The current Rule uses "held temporarily" rather than "retired", in
conflict with Rule 790, which defines the former in terms of the
latter.]

Amend Rule 1626 ("Applications") by replacing the paragraph reading

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

with

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

[The rest of the Rule defines Signatures Platonically, in such a way
that an Application cannot contain illegal ones.]

Amend Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges") by replacing the paragraph
reading

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

with

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

[The original Rule only requires the penalty to be reported, not the
Infraction.]

If the last and second last paragraphs of Rule 1575 ("Standards of
Proof") are identical, delete the last paragraph.

[They certainly look identical to me...]

Amend Rule 663 ("Injunctions--General") by replacing "made by the
Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an Injunction" with "made by the
Board of Appeals in an Appeal to Append an Injunction".

Amend Rule 1564 ("Initiating Appeals") by replacing the text reading

      The elements that are permitted to be appealed, what the Board
      is to consider, and what results from its findings, are as
      follows:

        i) The Judgement of the CFJ;
       ii) The Dismissal of a CFJ;
      iii) An Injunction issued with a Judgement.

with

      The elements that are permitted to be appealed are as
      follows:

        i) The Judgement of the CFJ;
       ii) The Dismissal of a CFJ;
      iii) An Injunction issued with a Judgement.
       iv) The lack of an Injunction issued with a Judgement.

[Appeals to Append an Injunction are confused with Appeals of an
Injunction in both of these Rules.  Also, "what the Board is to
consider, and what results from its findings" are not in the list, but
are instead detailed in other Rules.]

Amend Rule 1695 ("Appeal of an Injunction") by replacing "report this
penalty" with "report this Infraction".

[Small bug there.]

Amend Rule 1504 ("Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions")
to read

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate as soon as possible any
      Payment Order(s) originally executed to apply the penalty, and
      any non-Currency part of the penalty is reversed to the extent
      possible immediately upon resolution of the appeal.

      The Player making the report of an Infraction shall execute
      whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply the penalty
      specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds that the
      Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is required to
      issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the Courts to vacate
      the Payment Order(s) originally executed to apply the penalty.

[The current wording is bad enough to have required an annotation, and
is almost self-contradictory.  This should hopefully bring this Rule
clearly in line with Pragmatic Currencies.]

Amend Rule 417 ("Duties of the Archivist") by replacing "game Winners
in past games" with "game Winners".

[We don't have Game Ends any more.]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") by replacing the paragraph

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following
      information:

with

      The Cartographor's Report contains the following information:

[Currently the Cartographor has no Official Report.]

If Rule 1754 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") exists, repeal Rule
1763 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II").

[Duplicate Rule.]

Amend Rule 1713 ("Debt") by removing the paragraph reading

      With the exception of this paragraph, this Rule shall have no
      effect prior to the first day of December, 1997.

[This one has done its duty.]

Amend Rule 1637 ("Wills") by replacing "treasury" with "entity".

[Old terminology.]

Amend Rule 1662 ("The Speaker's Gratuity") by replacing "At the end of
every month" with "After the end of every month".

[The current formulation could be taken to imply that the Registrar
has to pay out at an exact moment.  While there is game custom to the
contrary, this is still not a good formulation.]

Amend Rule 1682 ("Boors") by replacing the paragraph reading

      This Patent Title shall never be awarded or revoked by
      Directive.

with

      This Patent Title shall only be awarded or revoked as described
      in this Rule.

[We don't have Directives any longer.]

Amend Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") by removing the text ", or which would
allow em to reregister".

[The Pardoning system does not work due to this.  It doesn't help
having a precedence clause when the lowered-numbered Rule you are
trying to trump also has one...]

Amend Rule 1747 ("Pardoning Lawlessness") to read

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

["He/his" and some bad timing requirements have been changed.]

Amend Rule 1439 ("Blots Due to a CFJ") by replacing the text

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

with

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ. 

[Fixes a missing period and makes the Rule PC compliant.]

Amend Rule 1658 ("Tainting the Speaker") by replacing "permitted to
call such a Referendum" with "authorized to call such a Referendum".

[With all the Rule 116/1011 debates I don't feel that the word
"permitted" has enough weight for this purpose.]

Amend Rule 681 ("Giving Up Speakership") by replacing "the former
Speaker shall lose 1 VT" with "the new Speaker shall bill the former
Speaker 1 VT".

[PC compliance.]

Amend Rule 1590 ("Maintainer of SLCs") and Rule 1531 ("Administrators
and Their Duties") by replacing each instance of "Compact" with "SLC".

[Old terminology.]

Amend Rule 1651 ("The Silly Proposal") by replacing the pronoun "he"
with "e", and by replacing "The Assessor shall take note and report
this Silly VT" with "The Assessor shall pay out this Silly VT".

[Not PC compliant in any of the senses.]

I hereby transfer one Kudo from myself (Blob) to Sherlock, as an apology

board.
