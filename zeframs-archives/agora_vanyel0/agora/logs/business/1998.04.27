This Week with R-O-M

I show 340 Rules in the current Rule set.  My random number generator spit out
the following numbers:

188 = Rule 1503 Crimes and Infractions
153 = Rule 1756 Delinquent Judges
328 = Rule 1377 The Herald
218 = Rule 1047 Patent Title of Zeitgeist
121 = Rule 1583 Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players

I choose Rule 1047.  It's a little better now that three different entities
have to vote for the proposal, but I still see little incentive for Players to
actually vote against proposals, except for the very few highly controversial
ones that come up.

So, acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1047 (Patent Title of Zeitgeist)
          This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
          Rule 1047 is hereby Repealed.
