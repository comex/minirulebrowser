Evidently, I am not intelligent enough to understand the Probate Code.
If I am still Swann's Executor in Probate, I hereby resign. I strongly
urge Notary Murphy to appoint General Chaos as Swann's EiP.

CFJ 1070

"Immediately after becoming Speaker, Morendil was registered as a 
player."

Judge's verdict: TRUE

Reasoning and Arguments:

My original intent was to cover the ground trod by this statement as 
widely as possible, taking into account the whole sequence of events 
leading up to Morendil's Speakership.  It turns out that I have too 
little information, so I am only going to rule on the narrow question 
immediately raised by the statement, i.e. if the Rules specify a non-
Player as Speaker (which I'll assume for this Judgement to be the case) 
what exactly happens?

What exactly is a Player?

The only definition of Player we have in the Rules is from Rule 869, "A 
Player is any person who is registered as a Player."

So, from this it seems obvious that there is an equivalence between 
Playerhood and Registration.  While other rules may trump Rule 869 by 
taking precedence over the _method_ of registration, there's no 
particular reason to believe that the first sentence of 869 takes effect 
after the conflict is resolved after all, after someone becomes a 
Player, by any means, any conflict with the registration methods in 869 
is over with and 869 begins to reassert its authority, and by its 
authority it defines all "Players" as "registered."

To illustrate this, it is my opinion that if we adopted a Rule that 
defined players directly, as in some nomics, by saying "X, Y, and Z are 
Players." and that Rule took precedence over 869 (which it would have to
have effect at all) it is my opinion that after X, Y, and Z became 
Players, 869 would afterwards define them as Registered.

The other half of the question is a causal one.  Does becoming Speaker 
automatically mean you become a Player.  I think so.  The only Rule 
tying Speakership to the Players is Rule 103, and at fist blush all that 
Rule does is say that a Player cannot be both a Voter and a Speaker, an 
obsolete and archaic reference to when the speaker didn't vote.

But 103 directly defines the set of Players to include both the Voters 
and the Speaker, so the Power 3 Rule 103 defines "X is a Player" as in 
my example above.

Therefore I judge the Statement TRUE

Now I understand what these voting reminders are good for (in addition
to reminding people that they haven't voted yet).

H. Assessor, please note that I have already voted on many proposals
in the 3601-12 batch. Several people (including you, IIRC) commented
on my nonstandard use of the "-" to indicate a nonvote, so it must
have been distributed, too.

I have appended the old votes to this mail; please note that these are
not new or additional votes.

This is a small step for a PLAYER, but a LARGE step for Agora.

I call on prior Mad Scientist Harlequin until to overhand his records.

I note me ALSO that the last Mad Scientist's Report in my folders was from
12th October.  I interpret the Frankenstein Mutator some to require that I
perform the procedure ONE time for each of the five weeks in between, some
I believe earlier Mad Scientists also HAVE DONE.  I find though the phrase
"once a week" SLIGHTLY ambiguous:  means it that the Rule Changes must
take place IN each week, or merely FOR each week?

FORWARD to the FUTURE,
Ørjan.
