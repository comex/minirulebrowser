Guess what: I have _not_, in fact, fallen off the face of the earth.
(Newton would be happy.)  Since moving to Providence I have been swept
by a wave of business and, essentially, haven't been reading anything
Agora-related for that long.  I have been archiving; all five lists are
available at http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/agora/logs/ (the old quincy
addresses will no longer work, but everything should've been
transferred).

Am I even still a Player?  What sorts of bizarre crises have been cooked
up while I wasn't paying attention?  I did happen to notice Chris
Monsour's name on the list: welcome back, and congrats on getting to
Princeton (boo, hiss, rival Ivy League school :).  Could someone send me
a summary of the last month or so, though?  The mailfile

-rw-r--r--   1 dpb      grad     5444706 Sep 16 23:53 Mail/agora/nomic-in

is pretty daunting. :)

This got lost in my mailbox somewhere; I just found it cleaning out
old mail.  Unfortunately, because of the rather badly worded Rules
pertaining to Internomic Referenda, no Referendum can be held on it
(the Voting Period would be of negative length).  My apologies.
======================================================================

INP 347
Create a new rule with the text enclosed in ###:

###
InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal. 

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote. 

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.

###

Remarks: 

- - Note that 309 (voting period ends before the full two weeks'
time if all nomics have voted) cannot stop InterNomic from voting. In
fact, at the moment, with InterNomic eligible to vote but not doing
so, the second sentence of 309 never applies at all.

- - The last two paragraphs are needed because 332 does not make it
clear who will actually cast a valid vote (= "send a message to the
moderator" according to 207) for InterNomic.

- - Note that the moderator is not "voting for" IN in any sense; it's
just that someone has to do it, and the moderator is the only one with
the necessary information. A choice or free will of the moderator is
not involved, however. 

- - As a side effect, this will encourage IN member nomics to vote
early, so they can influence IN's vote.

The recent debate about the missed INP Referendum made me take a brief
look at the relevant Rules. It is still not quite clear to me whether the
Ambassador is permitted to Vote as e wishes or not - does the phrase "the
Referendum is undecided" include the case when the Referendum is not held 
at all?

What is clear to me, however, is that
1) Rule 1631 contains:

      Furthermore, the Ambassador shall maintain a record of the
      Ruleset of InterNomic, and shall post it to the Public Forum at
      least once a month.

2) The only message I can find in my folders which contains an Internomic
Ruleset, whether posted to Agora lists or Internomic lists, is from March
13.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Well, I had intended to Vote for Harlequin, but forgot to.  So, I cast
my deciding vote for Harlequin.
