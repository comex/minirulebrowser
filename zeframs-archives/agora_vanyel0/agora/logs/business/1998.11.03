Splut. RL strikes again, with aid from P3792.

I deregister. I plan to stay tuned to the lists, but I don't have 
enough time to pay my POs, let alone vote. With the passage of 
mandatory voting, I don't feel that staying registered is worth it.

Re: BUS: Bye

Hmm.  It seems that a delay in message transmission caused me to incorrectly
assess a PI Infraction against Antimatter this past Monday.  I hereby vacate
POI082.

PS.  Sorry to see you go, Antimatter.  Glad you're going to keep tuned in.

DIS: my blots

Lee, don't worry, you still have a long way to go before Lawlessness - and
someone has to allege it to have effect anyway.

BTW, Lee, with the largest number of Blots, is the Miscreant.

FYI:

I am quite willing to work on and eventually  issue an Accountor's
report, but if i am deregistered because of my Blots, I will take all
my records with me, and someone else will have to do all that work, or
you will have to have a currency reform.
