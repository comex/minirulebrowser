Proto-Proposal
A Public Voting Experiment

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Election or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

Hm.  I have no Report on current Frankenstein Monsters.  I have it to
understand that I am required to maintain a schedule of them (which is
not a "Report", in the capitalized sense), but at present that
schedule is empty, as I have not yet had the opportunity to construct
it. 

Since at the moment I am not aware of the existence of any specific
Frankenstein Monsters, I thereby present you with an empty schedule,
with the disclaimer that it may be legally incorrect for this schedule
to be empty.  I invite proof of the existence of Frankenstein
Monsters, and when presented with reasonable proof, will amend the
schedule accordingly.

Regards,

General Chaos
Chancellor
