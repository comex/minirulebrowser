Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Stylishness of Rules}

     Every Rule has associated with it a value known as that Rule's 
     Stylishness.  A Rule's Stylishness shall be an integral value that 
     is positive, negative, or zero.  A Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     positive is a Stylish Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     negative is a Dull Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is zero is 
     a Generic Rule. Upon the adoption of this Rule all Rules are 
     Generic.
   
     The Wizard shall maintain a record of the Number of each
     non-Generic Rule and its associated Stylishness.  E shall publish
     this record at least once every two weeks.

{Comment: Removed the Rulekeepor from this since a) e has enough work,
          and b) There's no real reason e needs to maintain the 
          information since the Wizard is the one who acts on it.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Changes to Rules' Stylishness}

     Whenever a Proposal is adopted that changed the Proposer's Style, 
     every Rule that the Proposal amended shall have its Stylishness
     change by the same amount, and every Rule that the Proposal created
     shall have its Stylishness set equal to that amount.

     Every week, the Wizard shall randomly select one Generic Rule that 
     does not list the Player currently holding the Office of Wizard in 
     its Attribution.  When the Wizard selects this Rule e shall assign 
     it a new Stylishness based on the same criteria e uses for 
     proposals.  This new Stylishness shall be an integral value between 
     -3 and 3, not including zero.

     When a Rule's Stylishness changes, the Wizard shall record the 
     change and the reason for it.  E is required to publish these 
     changes in the Public Forum as soon as possible after they occur.

{Comment: Again, removed the Rulekeepor from this.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: The Style Machine}

     This Rule is known as the Style Machine and may be referred to 
     unambiguously in that manner.  The Executor of the Style Machine is 
     the Wizard.  The Style Machine is a Voting Entity.  Every time the 
     Wizard produces a report listing the Style changes due to
     Proposals, e shall also pay out a number of VTs to the Style
     Machine equal to the number of Proposals in that Report that
     changed their Proposer's Style. The Wizard is only permitted 
     to act on behalf of the Style Machine as explicitly directed in 
     this Rule.

     If the Style Machine possesses VTs, it shall act as follows;
     
       i) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote Against that Proposal.
      ii) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Dull Rules than Stylish 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote For that Proposal.
     iii) If neither i) or ii) apply, the Style Machine shall Abstain on
          that Proposal.

     If the Style Machine does not possess VTs, it shall act as follows;

      iv) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Stle Machine shall not declare its Presence for that 
          Proposal.
       v) If iv) does not apply, the Style Machine shall declare its 
          Presence on the Proposal.

     The Wizard must report Votes or declarations of Presence for the 
     Style Machine before the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal 
     in question.

     The Style Machine's votes shall count toward Quorum.  The Style 
     Machine's Votes cannot be changed once made.  This Rule takes
     precedence over the Rules covering Voting Entities and Votes in 
     general.

{Comment: This is now only work for the Wizard.  The extra work IMO is 
          offset by a measure of power e receives by modifying the 
          Stylishness of Rules.  The idea being that Stylish Rules are 
          slightly harder to change than Dull Rules.}

I have been MERCILESSLY NAGGING Harlequin to make him deliver to ME the
records of the Mad Scientist, to NO AVAIL.

More carefully reading the Rules I find that Harlequin was removed from
Office when he went On Hold, and the Speaker (WHO WAS MORENDIL) became Mad
Scientist.  The Registrar's Report has been in ERROR.

I have not been successful in retrieving the records, and will SO HAVE TO
do my Mutations without knowing certainly which ones may take effect, and
not EVEN completely certain when the last Mutation was (I _believe_
October 12.)

One of YOU should have the Records, and if not, MORENDIL is the last
elected ARCHIVIST and so should be able to dig up the information.

I request Records of:

- ALL successfully applied Proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule,
their Proposal Numbers, and the identity of the Entities who Proposed
them.

- ALL reports of Frankenstein Mutations and other non-Proposed Rule
Changes to the Frankenstein Rule.

BURN the BOOK-BURNERS,
Ørjan.

PROTO1: Risky Quorum

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Risky Quorum}

     Once in every week in which Proposals are distributed, the Promotor 
     shall select one of those Proposals at random to have a reduced 
     Quorum.  The Promotor shall not reveal the identity of this 
     Proposal to anyone until the results of voting upon that Proposal
     are announced.  The selected Proposal shall have a Quorum of one.
     This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
     Proposals.


PROTO2: Quorum buyback (Something to do with P-Notes)

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Buyback}


     Any Player other than the Promotor is permitted to buyback Quorum 
     on a particular Proposal.  This can only be done once by any Player 
     for any single Proposal. A Player does this by informing the 
     Promotor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a specified Proposal. 
     That Player can rescind eir buyback before the end of the voting 
     period by sending a message stating so to the Promotor.

     The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not rescinded) 
     is to reduce the Quorum on that Proposal by one.  If multiple 
     Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal, the effect is 
     cumulative.

     At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Promotor 
     shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for 
     each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Promotor shall then bill 
     each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

     The Promotor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a 
     Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

     This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
     Proposals.


PROTO3: Quorum without objection

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Without Objection}

     The Speaker has the power to, Without Objection, designate any 
     Proposal whose voting period is underway to have achieved Quorum.  
     That Proposal shall then have its Quorum adjusted to equal the 
     number of Players who had already voted on it at the time the 
     Speaker made the designation.

     This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
     Proposals.

     Once, for every week in which Proposals are distributed, the
     Assessor shall, in the 72 hours after the end of that week, select
     one of those Proposals at random to have a reduced Quorum.

Proto-Proposal: Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Speaker may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire. 

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

[v2 Changed the declaration to be Without Objection]

----

Comment: If the power can only be wielded Without Objection, would people
mind if it were given to the Registrar rather than the Speaker? I would 
like to start giving more discretionary powers to the Officers.
