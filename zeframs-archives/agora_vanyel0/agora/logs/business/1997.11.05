Vir is and was a senator when P3581 became a Senate Proposal.  This is a COE.

Quoth Rule 1717/0 (in part)

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

I had voted at the time it became a Senate Proposal, and at that time, I
was a Senator.

I'll note that R1717 does not prevent me from changing my votes, since I am
now a senator.

Having considered your arguments, I agree that you are now a Senator,
since you have now been registered continuously for the past two
months. I was wrong to assume that a Player's status as Senator is
fixed for the duration of the VP of a Proposal. So, ChrisM, for
example, although not now a Senator, will become one sometime on Nov
13, perhaps in time to vote on P3581. However, I maintain that you
were not a Senator at the time of Morendil's announcement, since at
that time you were 97 minutes short of having been registered
continuously for two months at that time.

So I agree with one of your claims and disagree with the other. Does
that mean I should admit or deny your Claim? I guess that, since in
any case my original assertion was incorrect, I should admit the
Claim. So: COE admitted. The correct list of Senators is currently:

I am afraid that Vir cannot change his Vote on Proposal 3591.  Rule
1717 states "[I]f any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on
a Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes on
that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change thereafter[...]".
Vir had already cast a Vote on Proposal 3591 prior to its becoming a
Senate Proposal; therefore, Vir's Vote cannot be changed, his new
status as a Senator notwithstanding.

I'm still trying to puzzle out what the effect of "the cost of casting
those Votes is transferred to them" will be.  Does this require the
Assessor to issue a Payment Order refunding the cost of that ABSTAIN
vote?  Furthermore, it is not at all clear what happens to the delayed
Transfer Order submitted by Vir when e Voted.  It would have made far
more sense if the Rule had merely cancelled the Votes of non-Senators,
instead of changing them to ABSTAIN.

On top of all that, the grammar in this Rule is terrible.  Who wrote
this piece of junk?

Except that now that I am a senator, that sentence no longer applies to me.
 Sure, my votes were changed to ABSTAIN immediately following it becoming a
senator proposal, but now that I am a senator, that sentence does not apply
to me and my votes were changed to FOR when I made that change.

I hereby resign as CinC, appointing Vlad as my successor.

I hereby move to the Stasis Chamber, going On Hold in the process.

Sigh. Life is busy. No time for Agora anymore -- I've got a week's worth
of mail waiting to be read right now. Hope I can return to the fold
soon...

R1743 again.

Two things.  First, conditions not being met for R1743 in my original
post, *all* my attempts to vacate POs were invalid and I assume that posting
had no effect on the status of any Indulgence POs.  Second, I note that because
I now hold the Office of Herald temporarily, I am unable to delegate this
Office until after the elections (unless I have missed another Rule somewhere).
So we'll have to wait to resolve this R1743 thing for a while yet.

I don't know whether the current Rebellion eliminates the significance
of the above, but I accept the office of CinC pro-tem, if necessary, and
nominate myself for the Office in the current election.

I disagree: R1478 states that an Executor of an Entity is a Player.
R1738 states that an EiP is an Executor. I conclude that one cannot
remain an EiP if one ceases to be a Player.

I call for the Appeal of this Judgement.
