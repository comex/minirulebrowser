I sent several important messages to the PF last
Friday and have not received any of them back.  I
haven't seen any other messages either, except one
from Oerjan on agora-discussion.  I wonder if the
attempt to block spam messages is blocking
everthing else too?  I wonder if I'll ever see
this message?
