And I wondered if the "Perl regular expression" feature on my
Rules search page would ever be used!  (I searched for "\nCFJ" (no
quotes), "Perl regular expression" checked Yes, "Rule text only"
checked No.  This would have also picked up any Rule whose title
began with "CFJ", but it turns out there are currently no such
Rules.)

Rule 114 also has a mandatory annotation:

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 920, Apr. 17 1997: Rule 114 should be interpreted such that a
change to the rules such that they instantaneously thereafter do not
permit modification of the rules is not prevented from occurring by
Rule 114 if it leaves the gamestate such that after some definite
finite or infinitesemal time interval the rules will again change such
that the gamestate then satisfies Rule 114's condition.
Relevant Rules: 114

[CFJ 906: the term 'ruleset' as used within Rule 114 refers to a set
 of information that includes all Rules, and not merely to a
 representation of that information.]

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 114, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1077, date unknown
Amended by Proposal 1277, Oct. 24 1994
Renumbered from 1077 to 114 by Rule 1295, Nov. 1 1994

The following Rules have anomalous histories:

Rule 1643: The annotation for the amendment gives Amendment Number 2
but the headline gives Amendment Number 1.  The annotation is probably
misnumbered.

Rule 1568: The annotations for the fourth amendment gives Amendment
Number 3 (should be 4).  The annotation is almost certainly misnumbered.

Rule 1662: The annotations show two amendmentws but the headline gives
Amendment Number 3.  Either the headline is wrong or an annotation is
missing.

Andre,

Welcome back!  (Sorry to take so long to mention this).

Unfortunately you left us while holding onto a Fugitive Blot, so it is my unfortunate duty to hereby order you to pay one (1) Indulgence to the Bank.

Andre's Fugitive Blot is hereby destroyed.

Well, I managed to get through at least most of the rules.

I hereby request Registration.

Maybe I should have waited until I was eligible for a grace period again,
but I decided that that was too long (2 months)

However, more important was the following loophole I found in the rules:
A Payment Order can be satisfied by submitting a Transfer Order - but it
does not matter whether or not this Transfer Order is effective! That is,
if there is a Payment Order ordering me to pay 1 VT to the Bank, I can
just submit a Transfer Order for that 1 VT, even if I do not have Voting
Tokens, and this will satisfy the PO.

Well, I got some more ideas while reading the ruleset, but you'll hear
of them (probably) later.
