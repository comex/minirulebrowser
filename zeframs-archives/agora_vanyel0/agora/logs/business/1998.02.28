H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-notes to increase
its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Groups can vote in Referenda

Be it hereby resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Vote) be
amended to read:

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals, Referenda and Elections as if it were
      a Player. Such votes are cast by the Organization's Executor,
      acting on behalf of the Organization.
