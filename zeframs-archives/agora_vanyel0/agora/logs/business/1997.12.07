H. CotC elJefe!

I hereby submit the following CFJ:

Statement:

Votes were cast on Proposals 3601-3613.

Arguments:

The following summarizes, I hope, the consensus reached in
discussions between Crito, Chuck and myself concerning the casting of
votes during the period of the infection of R1598. Any mistakes are
my own.

The infection of R1598 invalidated the Rule which defines Transfer
Orders. We accept that this had the effect of making impossible the
execution of any delayed implicit Transfer Orders such as would
ordinarily arise from messages sent to the Public Forum purporting to
be voting messages. Since both Rules 1442 and 206 state that the
casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of Voting
Tokens, it was initially thought that it would be impossible to cast
votes on any Proposals whose Voting Periods concluded during the
period of the infection of R1598. This initial view is reflected in
the Assessor's Report of the results for Proposals 3601-3613, in
which all the Proposals are listed as having failed, with no votes
cast either for or against them.  

However, Crito has persuasively argued that this initial view is
mistaken. A closer look at R1442 shows that, despite the connotations
ordinarily attached to the word 'spend', the spending of Voting Tokens
for the purposes of R1442 does not require the execution of the
implicit delayed Transfer Orders which normally arise from voting
messages. It requires only the submission of such Transfer Orders,
and this is not blocked by the infection of R1598. R1442 states
that:

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal...

Since R1442 begins by stating that the casting of any votes may only
be achieved by the spending of VTs, and since the Rule also obviously
accepts that votes are cast when a voting message appears in the PF,
it follows that the submission of the implicit delayed TOs associated
with the votes in a voting message is sufficient, for the purposes
of R1442, for regarding VTs as having been spent. The execution of
those TOs is not necessary. Hence the infection of R1598 did not
prevent the casting of votes on Proposals 3601-3613.
