H. Herald Crito--

I hereby execute the following Transfer Order:

===========================================================================
TRANSFER ORDER
>From elJefe to the Bank, 1 Indulgence.
===========================================================================

I state that this transfer order is being submitted for the purpose of
satisfying POI031.

I further state that this same transfer order is being submitted for the
purpose of satisfying POI048.

I further state that this same transfer order is being submitted for the
purpose of satisfying POI061.

I further state that this same transfer order is being submitted for the
purpose of satisfying POI079.


(So it has four purposes!  I believe this works, in accordance with the
precise wording of Rule 1732.    :-)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1732/0 (Power=1)
Satisfaction of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order from the
      payor named in that Payment Order to the payee of that Payment
      Order for the currency and amount named in that Payment Order is
      successfully executed, provided that, when that Transfer Order
      was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated that that
      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Regards,
-- elJefe
