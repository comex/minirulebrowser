I hereby submit the following Proposal.  Now would someone be so kind as to
fund the darn thing?  I seem to be in need of a few Houses...



Proposal:  Plots


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes precedence over any
      Rule attempting to prevent Churches from having this effect.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

Since Time Agent seems to have gotten stuck in his TARDIS, I hereby remove
em as Trustee of Vir's estate.  I appoint myself in eir place.

Technically, the Accountor, Promotor, Herald, Order Vizier, and Jester
are supposed to confirm my belief that Vir possesses 31 Indulgences and
no other Currency or debts.  In practice, we all know by know that this
is the case.  Vir also had no Will.  I therefore submit the following
plan for Vir, under the usual Without Objection clause:

  * Transfer 31 Indulgences to the Bank

Metagaming or Roleplaying - two Approaches to Playing Nomic
===========================================================

by Kolja A.


I. Introduction
===============

I am a bit disappointed about the flame-war like athmosphere that is
surrounding the present Officer's veto scam and its prelude, the
recent rebellion and elections, and its aftermath, the impeachment of
several officers involved in the scam. Such a brilliant scam, exposing
and using a huge loophole, not really doing any damage to the game as
a whole, and what a high degree of organization and preparation that
went into this project! And here we are fighting over side issues like
little children instead of enjoying, pushing or opposing the main
event...

Instead of joining the melee of accusations, Kudo transfers,
suspicions and fingerpointing that are surrounding this scam (and,
probably, any other scam of similar proportions) I would like to take
one or two steps back and try to figure out why tempers are boiling so
high in this particular case. 

True, tempers will always rise in the critical days that decide the
success or failure of a major scam attempt. But at the moment a lot of
bad feelings are not centered around the scam itself at all, but
around its preliminaries and its aftermath. My impression is that
these problems are not connected to the scam at all, but to a
different development that happened during the recent elections: a
strong shift towards a political, roleplaying style of playing nomic,
mixing in an unclear way with the traditional athmosphere of Agora,
where the metagaming approach dominates and many (metagame) issues are
discussed freely.

Let me make clearer what I mean by political roleplaying
vs. metagaming.


II. Metagaming vs. Roleplaying Approach
=======================================

On the metagame level, which traditionally dominates Agora, 

1. Officers invest a lot of time and effort to keep the game
going. Running for office, and holding office, is in fact, and is
generally considered to be, a service to the Agora community.

2. Players freely discuss the background of their actions:
motivations, intentions etc are not secret (except, for a limited
time, if secrecy is needed for the success of a scam; but even in
these cases after the success strategy and other "behind the scenes"
issues are publicized and srutinized freely.) In fact, these
discussions are an important part of enjoying the game for some
players.

3. Successfull (or spectacularly failing) scams, (ab)use of loopholes,
and other "creative" and unexpected ways of making things happen are
accepted, and even applauded and enjoyed by all players. This includes
things that would be seen as unacceptable, objectionable or at least
in very bad taste in real life (legal or not), like bribery, secret
conspiracies, quibbling and going to the courts over election results
and formalities etc.

4. Losing an election, having a proposal rejected etc is taken in good
humour and not interpreted as an expression of personal dislikes
between players, declaration of personal mistrust or accusation of
misbehaviour by anyone. 

5. Players tend to form their opinions and decide their votes on a
case-by-case basis, focusing on facts, concepts and their ideas of
what an ideal nomic should be like, not on the persons involved. If
any, there are only very temporary alliances between players, and
there are few, if any, personal feuds going on between them (in fact,
players who believe to be on the receiving end of such personal
vendettas tend to leave in a huff fairly quickly...)

This level of playing is similar to what roleplayers call "out of
character" (OOC) or out time level.


On the more political/roleplaying level, focusing on the same aspects
of the game as in 1. - 5. above, 

1. Being an officer gives you power and wealth. To a great degree this
is due to recent changes, most notably the increasing scarcity of VTs
(leaving officers' salaries as the only regular source of income) and
the immediate influence officers can exert on the game due to the
authority given to them by rules (including, but not limited to the
officers' extra votes that have been used in the current scam). These
changes were intentionally introduced in order to emphasize the "in
character" desirability of holding office - even including powers that
were intentionally constructed such that they can be "abused" for the
personal interests of the officer.

2. There is a lot of speculation as to the motives of players - in
fact, many of the recent flames centered around allegations of what
was done by whom for what reason, and whether these (perceived,
constructed or publically confirmed) motives were "honorable", in
keeping with Agora's traditions etc. 

3. Grabbing for power, scamming, being "greedy" (i.e. trying to gain
control of important resources of the game) etc. are regarded as bad
things that must be opposed, and may occasionally even be declared as
dishonorable (while the scammers then point out that they could have
legally taken over the whole game and expect applause because they
didn't). Being on the losing side, seeing the winners rejoice and
enshrine their success in monumental rules etc can be felt to be a
humiliating defeat that cries for revenge, and so forth.

4. In elections, impeachment procedures and other decisions, the
personal honor or integrity of players and/or groups is at
stake. Losses are seen as humiliating defeats, and even attempted
impeachments are seen as personal (occasionally even "OOC") attacks on
a players reputation and integrity. (see paragraph C. of chapter III) 

5. Decisions are influenced by political wheeling and dealing, forming
of coalitions and fractions held together by mutual support (or
feuding) along lines that are partly defined by consent on basic
issues, partly on personal relations, likes and dislikes, and only
occasionally by an agreement on the detailed issues at hand. (Let me
add that this aspect of politics is what gives it such a bad
reputation in large parts of the public.)

This level is similar to the "in character" (IC) or "in time" level of
roleplaying.


III. How to Choose Between the Two Approaches
=============================================

If you look at these different aspects of the game, each of you will
be able to find numerous examples for all the points I mentioned and
for contributions to the Agora mailing lists that treated these points
on an "in character" or "out of character" level. The contributors may
not always have chosen their level of play deliberately; sometimes
they even included remarks that I would classify as IC or OOC in one
and the same statement, and sometimes different players would classify
the very same remarks or actions as IC or OOC. 

On a meta level, of course, the interesting question is: How do we
decide whether to act - or to treat and evaluate a player's action -
on the meta (OOC) or the roleplaying (IC) level?

The main purpose of this essay is to encourage discussion of this
question, and to make some initial contributions. Let me just try some
explanations of how we choose the playing level.


As I mentioned above my impression is that by and large the
metagaming, or OOC, level of playing is the standard in Agora's
traditions. I will therefore focus on some reasons why we occasionally
switch from this detached style of playing to a more personally
involving, role playing style.

Obviously, saying that the metagaming approach is typical for Agora
implies that other nomics, or even some players of Agora, may favour a
more roleplaying approach as a general preference. But in addition, I
can think of the following reasons why even people who usually prefer
a more detached, metagaming style occasionally go for a more "in
character" approach.


A. What's in a Name? or: Rules that Encourage Roleplaying.
----------------------------------------------------------

Often we seem to be influenced by quite superficial guidelines such as
names of procedures and actions. Let me quote just one example:

An "impeachment" is not seen as what it is in the rules of Agora (just
one of many ways to remove players from office, and one of the most
difficult ones at that) but interpreted similar to a procedure which
exists in the US American constitution, with a very different function
and purpose, but which happens to have the same name and some similar
results (removal from office) as the Agora procedure. Aspects like the
officer's personal integrity and honor are not connected to Agora
impeachments at all (it isn't even necessary to provide a reason for
an Agora impeachment); they are introduced into the Agora discussion
merely by the parallel with US politics.

Other similar concepts which are quite neutral, some so much so that
they are really quite useless and empty forms with no real content,
within the Agora rules are "rebellion" and everything to do with
locations. This is most obvious in the requirement that changes of the
rebelling/abiding status must happen "in" a location called "Beer
Hall". These concepts derive their colour and their fun (role
playing!) aspect solely from their names and the real life concepts
they remind us of.


B. Time of Crisis: Off with 'Eir 'Eads!
---------------------------------------

As we all remember from the scams we've seen before it is easy to get
a bit carried away when big scams are getting closer to the "make or
break" point. Players who are involved with the scam want to see their
schemes succeed, and are hurt if someone opposes their plans on an
inappropriate level. Not that you don't expect any opposition at all
(it wouldn't be fun that way) - but usually you do expect to prevail
in the end. It can be frustrating to see your efforts spoilt by an
unexpected move. As long as that spoiling move has some scam or
loophole surfing potential in itself, it is at least fun on the meta
level; but getting opposition that just denounces scam attempts as
dishonourable, on the "IC" level, tends to draw responses on the same
level. In a similar way, some scamsters in the recent scam have been
reacting very adversely, both on the IC and OOC level, to attempts
(IC, in my opinion) of some players to roleplay their (IC)
"frustration" about the succeeding scam via rebellions and
impeachments, because they felt that the attack was aimed at the
scamsters' persons, not the scam itself (a separation that quite
clearly belongs to aspect 5. of IC vs OOC actions).

The frustration to see one's plans stopped cold is something we can
deal with on a detached level if we are talking about small projects,
and projects that clearly happen on the OOC level where we all strive
to build, run and improve a nice little nomic game. But as soon as you
get closer to reaching a big goal, obviously the stakes are higher,
and emotions are more easily triggered - no matter whether the big
goal is a spectacular scam, a big reform project (like PC or plots) or
a new idea elsewhere. The more the big goal lends itself to an
emotional embellishment on the roleplaying level, the stronger this
tendency (remember the Kudo thrashing that Morendil received after eir
"treason" against the New Rishonomic "invasion" attempts?).

On the other hand, those opposed to a scam will also tend to favor a
roleplaying, IC approach. Partly because as soon as the scam becomes
visible, stopping it becomes their "big goal"; partly because scams
often win or fail depending on how well, how fast and how completely
the potential opposition can be mobilized, and drumming up support
against a scam often seems to be easier in an emotional, rhetorically
decorated way.


C. The Game Master's Nightmare: Mixing IC and OOC play
------------------------------------------------------

While I'm not a roleplayer myself, I'm told that one of the worst
things that can happen in a roleplaying group is when players start to
mix IC and OOC information, values and (meta) rules.

This confusion was the reason for many of the recent arguments, I
think - rebellions, impeachments etc played out (at least from the
acting players' point of view) as "in character", but seen by others
as "out of character" attacks on the persons holding office, etc.

I think that blurring the line between IC and OOC makes it extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to discuss matters of game strategy in a
constructive way, and especially so if it comes to questions about the
fairness, adequacy, living up to Agora traditions or the general moral
evaluation of certain game moves. I will not elaborate further on this
point, but would ask the reader to notice that the two approaches to
gaming, esp. referring to points 1, 3 and 4, are concerned with the
very same set of gaming actions, but reach completely different
conclusions as to what gaming moves should be applauded or deplored,
supported or opposed, and generally be considered enjoyable and good
or annoying and bad.



IV. Historical remarks:
=======================
 My involvement in the recent trends towards more In Character playing.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always tried to support rule changes that encourage roleplaying
not as a meta game agreement on playing style, but from within the
rules. For example, this trend has led to the developments sketched in
aspect 1. of the roleplaying approach.

The elections after the recent rebellion then opened up a new avenue
to explore in the direction of more roleplaying, for several reasons.
Some players were disappointed (at the OOC level) about the
rebellion. Without knowlegde of the impending scam, which was prepared
by this rebellion and the following elections, the rebellion seemd
like a rather lame attempt to demonstrate a loophole in the delegation
rules and create a lot of work for the registrar for a very limited
entertainment value.

At the same time, the following elections had candidates for most
offices in combinations that made group based voting patterns a
possibility, as candidates belonging to the Threat were facing
candidates belonging to the Order of the Evil Eye. 

Of course, in hindsight this wasn't a coincidence, at least not from
the point of view of the Threat, who needed to grab both a sufficient
number of offices and some particular key offices, including
speakership, to secure the success of their scam. At the time, I
didn't know this, of course, and being both a member of the Order, and
not a candidate in any election, I decided to play in a more
roleplaying style than usual, making some propaganda to portray the
elections as a struggle against total domination of Agora by the
Threat. 


Now of course I didn't really fear any bad consequences for Agora in
the case that all Threat candidates would win, and I was blissfully
unaware both of the scam that was to follow and even of the
possibility that these elections might be more than the aftermath of a
lame loophole exploitation (sorry to you Threats for not expecting
more of you...). In fact, my impression that these elections were
essentially meaningless, pitting qualified and trustworthy candidates
against each other anyway, was one of the reasons why I chose to try
and spice up these otherwise boring elections with a bit of rhetoric.

My attempts were a big political failure, of course - I did manage to
polarize the situation a bit, but in the end the Threat managed to win
(nearly) everywhere, although the Speaker's tie break was required in
most cases. 


Another attempt of mine to roleplay some more politics failed shortly
after that: after the Threat won several offices right away, and
Speaker Steve announced eir first tie break in favour of a Threat
candidate, I saw two strategies for the Threat (in what I thought to
be just another set of elections): grasp as much power as possible,
leaving the game, and especially the holding of offices and the salary
distribution in a rather unbalanced shape; or try for some more
balance between the groups.

I tried to entice Speaker Steve to follow the latter strategy (by
breaking the remaining two ties in favour of the Order's candidates)
not in a direct, metagaming approach (by simply mailing em and asking
em to do so), but in a roleplaying way: by rebelling, and thus
roleplaying my dissatisfaction with the situation, embellishing this
with the strong rant I added to the message in which I rebelled. 
Whether Steve just broke the ties in favour of the Threat to
make the upcoming scam work, or whether my IC Beer Hall "diplomacy"
simply failed, I don't know, but I certainly didn't reach my goal,
plus I annoyed Steve enough for em to deKudo me...

At the same time, my allegations that the Threat would hold too much
power after winning all these elections (which was not much more than
rhetoric to me at the time, because, as I said, I didn't fear any
destructive game play from the Threats) turned out to be true, of
course, but: only in the sense of the short term, IC meaning of the
roleplaying approach to point 3. above. On a more detached, meta
level, I am more than willing to applaud the Threat, following the
metagaming approach to aspect 3.


In order to be complete, let me add that I am still not sure whether
my voting for the impeachment of the officers who used their officers'
vote in this scam was an undue, dishonorable or whatever thing to
do. It was certainly more in the roleplaying spirit concerning aspect
3., but I am still not sure what was so wrong about it - except that
it provoked reactions from the impeached officers which I never
intended (see chapter III C).


V. Personal Conclusions
=======================

At the moment I am doubly disappointed about the results of my attempt
to roleplay more politics: not only did I fail and the Threat prevail
in all respects, as far as the IC level of playing is concerned; I
also annoyed several players I respect, and would never want to accuse
of destructive behaviour on the metagaming level, in a way that
triggerred the unpleasant blurring of the line between IC and OOC
play, outlined in chapter III C. above. I don't feel I have to
apologize for anything (nor has Sherlock, in my opinion), but I'm
certainly not content with what happened and with the results my
actions led to, and I am sorry for unintentionally hurting the
feelings of Steve and others.

Obviously, the metagaming approach is very deeply rooted not only in
Agora's traditions in general, but also in the minds, and instincts,
of many key players of the game. I still think that the roleplaying
approach has its own merits, too; and I wouldn't want to discourage
other players to pursue such an approach, like Sherlock did so
consistently and courageously in the face of considerable opposition. 

But the fun of roleplaying must somehow be balanced against the danger
of frustrating valuable, and irreplacable, key players of the game
(you know who you are). Ideally, these players will understand that
they have occasionally drawn the line between IC and OOC play
elsewhere than other players, and have interpreted moves as personal
attacks that weren't meant as such. Then we can maintain the open and
friendly athmosphere of Agora, characteristic for the metagaming
approach with respect to aspects 1.-5., while we can still have fun in
times of crisis, going into roleplaying mode for short periods of time
and where appropiate; and, lastly, we can accomodate players with
varying preferences concerning the proportion of roleplaying and
metagaming - this is the biggest challenge for an open nomic, after
all: getting (and keeping) together players with different goals,
styles and preferences and moving somewhere together, having fun along
the way.

The atmosphere has heated up, but only a little. This has been one of
the most civilized responses to a scam in my experience. After the
Mousetrap scam, comparisons were made between myself and Adolf Hitler!
It's interesting to think about why these two scams generated such
different levels of heat in response. (If you haven't read Swann's
history of the Mousetrap scam - although I bet you have - I recommend
that you do so. It's a document as fine in its way as your own, and
there are many points of contact between them.) Firstly, the nature
of the loophole that the Mousetrap scam attempted to exploit made it
politically a 'dirtier', more controversial kind of scam, since it
attempted to force Players into the Jurisdiction of a Organizational
Compact without their consent, something that was bound to cause a
lot of antagonism. By contrast, the Officer's Veto scam is a
relatively 'clean' scam. Secondly, the legality of the loophole was
much more seriously - indeed, successfully - questioned, in a way
that the legality of the Officer's Veto loophole or the instrument
loophole has not really been (although Antimatter's CFJ is now getting
a fair bit of attention). This explains why so-called 'side issues'
are getting more attention.

Interesting. These 'one or two steps back' signal to me that you are
entering metagaming mode, in which Players' motivations, intentions,
etc are freely discussed, as you describe in II.2 below. Your remarks
in sections IV and V are also pretty clearly in metagaming mode. Yet
one of the purposes of the article appears to be the defence of the
roleplaying approach. It seems to me significant that this defence
of the roleplaying approach comes in the metagaming style. This suggests
to me that the two approaches are not really in conflict with each
other, as you occasionally seem tempted to suggest, but are rather
complementary.

That is a very interesting question, and I'd like to make a
contribution of my own. As an example, consider Sherlock's calls for
Impeachment, and my reaction to it. In your article, you put
forward a kind of theory about these events in terms of the
metagaming vs roleplaying distinction you introduce. The theory goes
that Sherlock's actions were more properly interpreted as roleplaying
or in character actions, and that my indignant response to it arose
from having misinterpreted those actions as personal attacks on the
metagame or out of character level. But the truth may be more
complicated than that, and may result in the blurring of the
distinction between roleplaying and metagaming. For consider this
alternative theory: although perfectly well aware that Sherlock's
actions were not intended as personal attacks on the metagaming
level, in my judgement the most politically effective way to reply
to them was to respond to them as if they were. Now, putting it
that way makes it sound as if my responses to the situation were
entirely cynical and manipulative, and that is not true. I genuinely
was upset at the prospect of being Impeached. Nevertheless, I also
did think that allowing other Players to see that I was upset, instead
of hiding my upsetness beneath a mask of urbanity, was probably a
better course to take. All of which is to say: I can be roleplaying
even when I'm metagaming; it doesn't have to be one or the other.

I think this shows in my general play. On the one hand, you might
count me as one of the most active political roleplayers: I make
shady deals in smoky, if virtual, backrooms, I form alliances
with Players based on mutual interest and convenience rather than
on principle, and in general involve myself in all the kinds of
activities which you rightly characterize as typical of the
political roleplayer. I've also joined you in trying to get Rules
adopted which encourage this 'sharp' style of political play.
Hence my campaigns to abolish free voting, introduce VT scarcity,
and so on.

On the other hand, I'm also one of the most active metagamers. I love
the kind of analysis you engage in in your article, or that we see in
Swann's history of the Mousetrap scam, and I've written quite
theoretical essays about Nomic myself: on the concept of breaking the
Rules, on the relationship between Power and precedence, on the
concept of a 'Rule Change' in the Initial Set. I have a
theoretician's interest in voting systems and how they interact with
human psychology. I've studied game theory, and I'm particularly
interested in mathematical approaches to situations of negotiation.

It seems to me that in my own personal case, I've developed a
role for myself as metagamer, which I play with great enthusiasm.
I'm not denying the utility of your distinctions, but they do have
their limits.

Has anyone else here read David Foster Wallace's _Infinite Jest_?
I'm thinking in particular of the extraordinary passage concerning
the Enfield Tennis Academy game of Eschaton, which illustrates this
point.

At the time, my rationale for acting as I did was that I'd invested
considerable time and political capital in bringing about a situation
in which I might get to make those decisions, and so it seemed a waste
not to follow through and make decisions favouring my political allies,
even if it meant taking some heat for it.

But I've since had a change of heart, to the extent that I'd like to
make the following announcement. If two more of the 4 currently 
Rebellious Players (Harlequin, Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent)
will agree to become Abiding, so pushing the prospect of another
Revolt further into the distance, then I will use my Speaker's
Right to Call Elections to free up some of the Offices held by
the Threat, namely, Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.
Bearing in mind that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General
Chaos is not really contesting the Election), this will reduce
the number of Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically
restoring the political balance.

I just remembered that R1047 was amended by P3717. 

Registrar and Chancellor, please note: Swann did not earn the Patent

Player voted for it. I therefore vacate PO aaa135.
