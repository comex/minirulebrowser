As Notary, I hereby place Time Agent (or eir estate) in Probate, naming
myself as Trustee (unless someone else wants the job).

Accountor, Promotor, Herald, Order Vizier, Jester:  Rule 1738 requires
you to provide me ASAP with records of how much Currency Time Agent
possesses, and a list of all Payment Orders naming Time Agent as either
Payor or Payee.

(All POs?  That seems broken; should be "all POs which are neither
 satisfied nor vacated".)

COE: I destroyed these on 13-4-98 (I think it was noted in the April
13th Herald's report).
