H. Promotor, I hereby make the following Proposal, and transfer 1 P-Note to
the Bank for the purposes of raising its Priority to 1.

####
Proposal: Electees

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

with the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 910 ("The Justiciar") by replacing the text:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with the text:

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

and the text:

      only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion

with the text:

      Electee who is not the Speaker.
