Of late, I've been having some difficulties with the Archives website:
citing "security issues" the sysadmins say that linking to directories,
ftp-style, is no longer kosher (and now results in "permission denied"
errors).  Hrmph.

However, there is another proposal I've been thinking of making, which
would entirely obsolete the Office of Archivist and all its trappings
(well, I suppose the Office is already gone, but whatever).  Some other
lists I'm on (novial, conlang, auxlang) have been archived at
findmail.com for several months now, and it seems to be very stable and
convenient.  Not only does it keep the mailfiles, but it allows you to
access individually by message, and sort by date, author, thread, etc.
It even has a double-blind system for obscuring email addresses from
bots without preventing actual sending of email.

It does, however, involve relying on a completely outside source for
archiving, with no guarantee that the site will remain up permanently
(although it seems sufficiently well-established that that shouldn't be
a great worry).  It also would make the mail archives a bit more high-
profile than they currently are---an indexed system on a big website
instead of an obscure subpage of a user in an edu domain.  So I thought
I'd ask here before setting up a findmail archive.

I haven't had any communication with findmail about Agora yet.  So I
don't have any guarantees at all about how things would work.  Some
(potential) issues:
 * There are five lists to archive.  Would this irritate them? (probably
   not, but you never know.)  If I asked nicely, could I finagle a new
   subtopic for "Nomic" or "Rule-mutation games"?  If not, should I put
   it down as "Recreation:Games", "Recreation:Hobbies",
   "Recreation:Other", or something else entirely?
 * The lists are fairly high-traffic (at least in aggregate).  Will this
   be an issue?
 * Normally, the findmail people are quite happy to accept old archives
   and integrate them into their system.  How happy will they be about a
   several-hundred-megabyte archive dating back five years?

Anyway, unless I get any serious objections, I'll begin working on
setting things up over there sometime early next week.

I hereby overturn Judge's Kolja's decision. I disagree with eir
statement that "a challenge of such custom in a CFJ is enough to
change it". If the origin of a particular custom has some basis in
interpretation of the Rules, then I contend that Rule 217 does not
allow a Judge to return a contradictory Jugement merely because
of personal preference.

I am of the opinion that "specific" and related terms, as used in
the Ruleset and with the meaning that previous Game Custom have
imparted to these terms, do not necessarily imply exact, individual
specification of an existing and narrowly identified entity.

Phrases such as "I hereby ABSTAIN on all Proposals up for Vote",
variously qualified by conditionals such as "if possible", "if I have
not already done so", or "I delegate the Assessorship to whoever is
willing to take it up for a week", have in the past been accepted as
legal. In that context of allowing 'loose' specification, which
sometimes reach absurd extremes, I fail to see why a particular
Rule should be singled out for a different interpretation.

I am in agreement with fellow Justice Steve about the substance of
lee's Judgement, that is, to interpret "direct submission" as required
by Rule 1808 to exclude the Public Forum as a valid means of 
submission.

I further agree that the fact that the Judgement would invalidate a
number of Private Orders, mostly Transfer Orders, previously thought
to have been valid should not be a primary factor in the Board's
decision. (I do not agree, however, that we might just take these
erroneous transfers to have taken place and agree to 'ignore the
errors' as has been suggested, as this would represent a radical and
unwarranted departure from Agoran tradition in taking judicial 
findings into account; rather; I would hope to see most recent 
Official reports Ratified so as to correct for all such errors).

I also agree that supposed conflicts with prior Judgements are not a
major issue. Not only does Steve offer some arguments to the effect
that these prior Judgements can be seen as not conflicting; I also
believe that the requirement to consider 'past Judgements' in Rule
217 must be interpreted according to the literal meaning of 'past',
i.e. 'past Judgements' delivered in the recent past are by necessity
of more dubious value in guiding further Jugdgements that those
delivered several weeks, months, or years ago and which have 
demonstrated their usefulness.

Where I differ with Justice Steve is in his assessment of Rule 1808
as being, so to speak, unclear in such a way that the Judge was
justified in interpreting it as clearly having a different meaning
than it was previously thought to have.

If a controversy arises as to the meaning of one particular Rule, and
that controversy reaches the Board of Appeals, then I am of the
opinion that such a Rule can be validly called "unclear". If the Rule
were "clear", we would all be interpreting it in the same way, and
no argument would arise.

Thus, I believe this Board is justified in examining lee's Judgement
in the light of all factors mentioned in Rule 217, and overturning it
if overall the evidence and arguments against overweigh the evidence
and arguments for.

A crucial point offered by Judge lee in eir defense of the Judgement
(and not, as Steve note, in the Judgement proper) concerned the
wording of other Rules that might have been relevant to the
interpretation of Rule 1808, and in particular the uniqueness of Rule
1808 in including the phrase "directly to".

lee cited several Rules which require a given body of text to be
submitted to a particular Player and which have been in the past
interpreted as being satisfied by a post to the Public Forum. Judge
lee cited Calls for Appeal - not a particularly good example, as
Rule 1564 explicitly require such submissions to be to the Public
Forum. Other Rules which require a given text to be "submitted to" a
particular Player are 1789, 1792, 1726, 991, 1826...

In contrast, Rule 1808 is unique in requiring a given submission to
be made "directly to" a given Player. But for this argument to be
complete, we should also turn to other Rules which are known to
require a submission to be made to a given Player, *and* prohibit
such submissions to the Public Forum. There is one instance, Rule
1859 (Secret Voting), which calls for messages to be sent to "the
Vote Collector of the Proposal, Election, or Referendum _only_." 
(My italics.)

I contend that "directly to X" strongly differs in meaning from "to X
only". I believe it would be proper for a Judge to offer an
interpretation of the "directly to X" constrution, whether this
interpretation is such as to include Public Forum postings or not,
but I am loath to sustain a Judgement the text of which does not
allude to an issue which later emerges as being central to the
decision.

I therefore see no option but to call for reassignment.

Kolja is correct, the report is in error.  Although I reported Kolja's transfer
of an Indulgence to Morendil in the recent events section, somehow I neglected
to process the transfer itself.  Kolja's holdings should have been reported as:

                                 10Aug98    10Aug98  Change   Blots
Kolja A.                            3          0         -3        0


Additionally there should have been the following line within the Transfer
Order section:

Executed          Amt.   Payor            Payee              for PO Status
----------------  -----  ---------------  -----------------  ------ ---------
07Aug98 12:17:35      1  Kolja A.         Morendil                  Succeeded

As long as I'm here, per Rule 1791, if there is no objection, I will ratify the
10Aug98 Herald's report as amended by the above correction.
