While I appreciate the active way in which the Notary is trying to
execute Time Agents estate, it seems to me that it is not legal to
publish a plan before actually receiving info from all recordkeepors.

I will proceed under the assumption that Time Agent possesses no Irises

I submit the following plan for the completion of Time Agent's Probate:

Therefore the publication of the above plan seems to be premature, and
I object to it.

Sorry, Murphy, for making your job more difficult, but this is yet
another occasion where I would favor changing cumbersome rules over
ignoring them...

I just wanted to let everyone know that dfw.net, in its
infinite wisdom, has decided to change its name to nationwide.net
(Largely on account of the fact that it is now offering service
to those outside the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  Wait, I've been
here for a couple years, and I'm outside the DFW area.  Oh well...)

I'm told that my old address, ccarroll@dfw.net, will continue
to work for incoming mail, so don't worry about it too much.
However, outgoing mail will be marked as sent from ccarroll@nationwide.net.
I just wanted to warn people of this.  Since a-o and a-b only
allow posting from subscribers, I've subscribed under the new
address and asked for the old address to be removed.

Accordingly, I request that my official address be noted in
the Registrar's report as ccarroll@nationwide.net.
