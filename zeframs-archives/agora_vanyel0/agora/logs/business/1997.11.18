        Foundation for the Encouragement of New Players and Proto
        Proposing, if it exists.

        If there are still transferable Currencies remaining, they
        shall be distributed in integer amounts as equally as possible

        newest Player if there are none. The newest Player shall get
        any undivisible change or non-integer parts.

I understand that Steve's attempts to issue TOs in
order to settle Swann's Estate were ineffective. 
What is not clear to me is whether eir attempt to
vacate Swann's POs were effective.  The Probate
code seems to give Steve the proper authority
here, but it seems that each section may need to
be completed properly before the next.  Is the
authority invested in Steve to vacate POs at the
time e becomes EiP, or only at the time each step
becomes "effective"?  I welcome other's thoughts
on this.
