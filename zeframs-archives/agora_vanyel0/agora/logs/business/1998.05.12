Absolutely.  I have that proto ready, but I have no P-Notes to give it a good
priority.  I'll go ahead and propose it, but I solicit Players with P-Notes to
pay to raise it's priority.  I guess I'll make the same deal Steve made.  I'll
pay two VTs for each P-Note payed to raise it's priority - up to 3 P-Notes.

I hereby submit the following proposal:

Proposal
Fix Transfer Orders

Amend Rule 1799 by replacing the text:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.

with the text:

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended, stayed,
      or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders,
      Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer Order may be
      amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who executed it only
      during the time in which it is delayed.

Amend Rule 1598 by appending the sentence:

      If a Transfer Order purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order
      and either that Payment Order does not exist or cannot be
      satisfied by the Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is
      invalid.

PROTO: Ombudsman Mk II

Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman)

     There is a Patent Title of Ombudsman.  This title shall be awarded 
     in the following ways;

       i) If the prior Ombudsman designates an eligible successor, then 
          the Player designated by the Ombudsman is awarded the title.

      ii) If a referendum is called to award the title to an eligible 
          Player, then upon the passage of that referendum the title is 
          awarded to that Player.

     iii) If no Ombudsman exists, then the Speaker shall, in the Public 
          Forum, call for volunteers from amongst all eligible Players.  
          One week from this call, the speaker shall select one of the
          elgible voulenteers at random to become the new Ombudsman.

     Whenever a player is awarded the title of Ombudsman, that title is 
     removed from all prior holders.

     The player holding the title of Ombudsman shall be known as the 
     Ombudsman.

     If an Ombudsman ceases to be a Player, then eir title is removed.

{Comment: The Ombudsman isn’t an Office, and it’s only an elected
          position in certian rare curcumstances.  The idea is to create
          an advocate for the less powerful Players.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Elgibility to be Ombudsman)

     In order to be eligible to be the Ombudsman, the following must be 
     true of a Player;

       i) The Player must hold no Office nor be the Speaker.
      ii) The Player must not be On Hold.
     iii) The Player must not be Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group.
      iv) The Player has no Blots.

     If any of these conditions become false of any Ombudsman, that 
     Player has a period of 14 days to either correct the situation or 
     designate a willing successor in the Public Forum. If the Ombudsman
     fails to do either within the 14 day period, then the Title of 
     Ombudsman is immediately removed from that Player.

{Comment: The prerequisites of the Ombudsman exist to prevent eim from
          becoming part of a coalition.  E is intended to be 
          independent.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Designating a Successor Ombudsman)

     At any time, an Ombudsman is permitted to designate an eligible 
     player to succeed him as Ombudsman.  E must do this in the Public 
     Forum.  To be successful, this designation must be of a willing 
     player.

     If a successor is designated, and that Player is eligible to be the 
     Ombudsman, and that Player consents to be the Ombudsman in the 
     Public Forum within three days of the designation, then that Player 
     is awarded the title of Ombudsman either upon the designation, or 
     upon eir consent, whichever is later.

{Comment: This is intended to be the basic mechanisim for changing 
          Ombudsmen.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Referendum to replace the Ombudsman)

     Any Player can call for a referendum to replace the Ombudsman.  The 
     Player must make this call in the Public Forum, and the Referendum 
     must name an eligible Player to replace the current Ombudsman.  For 
     the referendum to begin, the named Player must consent in the 
     Public Forum within the two days immediately after the call.  If 
     the named Player consents, then the voting period begins as of the 
     consent.

     The default procedure for referenda changes as follows;  Vote 
     collector is the Player who called for the referendum.  Voting 
     entities only include players who hold no Office and are not the 
     Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group, and who are not the
     Speaker.

     If the referendum passes, the named player becomes Ombudsman, if it 
     fails, the referendum has no effect.

{Comment: This is the recourse to deal with an Ombudsman who doesn’t 
          perform to the ideals of the position.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Duties and Responsibilities of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman is responsible for being the voice of the people of 
     Agora.  His duties, broadly defined, are as follows;

       i) To help new Players acclimate to Agora by providing mentoring
          and guidance.
      ii) To hear grievances by the Players and bring them to the 
          attention of Officers and the Speaker.
     iii) To fight injustice insofar as the powers of the Ombudsman 
          allow.
      iv) To be an impartial and independent representative for all the
          Players of Agora.

     Other Rules shall define the specifics of these duties and 
     responsibilities.

{Comment: The broad outlines of what the Ombudsman is for. }


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Grievance Report)

     The Ombudsman has the responsibility to hear confidential 
     grievances from any Player about the game of Agora. The Ombudsman 
     shall regularly poll the people of Agora, with special attention to 
     those Players who hold no Office, and solicit their grievances.  In 
     addition, any Player with a grievance can submit their grievances 
     to the Ombudsman without being polled.  These grievances need not 
     be matters of law (which are subjects of the courts) but can be 
     manners of style, culture, fairness, and anything else that affects 
     a Player's ability to participate in Agora and enjoy doing so.

     Every week, the Ombudsman shall publish an Official Grievance 
     Report listing grievances e has received since the last such 
     report.  This report shall not give out the names of the Players 
     with these grievances unless the Player with the grievance 
     explicitly states that eir name is to be attached to the report, 
     otherwise all grievances given to the Ombudsman shall be 
     confidential and shall never be revealed.  This rule takes 
     precedence over any rule that would require or permit the Ombudsman 
     to violate this confidentiality.

{Comment: I think this would be useful, especially in times of crisis.
          Having an anonymous forum to vent might help with a historical 
          problem where Players have felt that their complaints about 
          the game resulted in personal attacks upon them.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Duty to New and Inexperienced Players)

     Upon the registration of any new Player the Ombudsman shall 
     communicate to that Player, as soon as possible, the fact that the 
     Ombudsman exists to be a mentor to that Player.  The Ombudsman 
     shall also provide the following services to any Player.

       i) To the best of eir ability answer any question about Agora. 
      ii) To assist any player in understanding the mechanics of a given 
          action (submitting/judging a CFJ, submitting a Proposal, 
          manipulating currency, and so on.)
     iii) To direct a player's query to the appropriate Officer. (Such 
          as FOIA requests and so on.)
      iv) Provide advice to any player who needs it.

{Comment: This is meant to be a replacement for the late Welcome Wagon,
          which never got rolling.  I think it would be nice for newbies 
          (and others) can have a centralized authority to consult 
          with in trying to play this increasingly complex game.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Special Privileges of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman shall have the following rights and privileges, to be 
     exercised only in the spirit of advocacy for *all* Agorans;

       i) Once every month, the Ombudsman is permitted and empowered to 
          vacate up to five Blots belonging a single individual Player.
          This must only be done to correct what the Ombudsman believes 
          to be an injustice to an otherwise Rule-abiding Player.

      ii) The Ombudsman is permitted to cast an additional two votes 
          AGAINST any proposal e believes disenfranchises a large number 
          of Players,  distributes power unfairly, or adversely affects 
          a large class of Players who do not themselves have the 
          resources to oppose.

     iii) The Ombudsman has the power to, once a week, pay out one of 
          any currency, other than an Indulgence, minted by the Bank to
          any single Player who has none of that currency.

      iv) If the Ombudsman Rebels, e counts as three players toward a
          Revolt.

     In addition, the Ombudsman shall receive a weekly stipend equal to 
     1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary, to be paid out by the 
     Registrar.

{Comment: These powers are designed to help the Ombudsman in eir
          duties.  I tweaked them a little so there’s less a chance of
          unbalancing Blots.}

     If a Proposal has been submitted by a Player during eir Grace 
     Period then that Proposal shall have an initial Priority of one.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

      However, If the votes were cast by a Player during eir Grace 
      period, then the Assessor shall instead bill that Player a number 
      of Voting Tokens equal to half the votes cast by that Player.
