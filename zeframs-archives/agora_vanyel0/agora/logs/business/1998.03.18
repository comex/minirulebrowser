Changes from v3.5 to v3.6:

* Initial VTs increased from 5 to 25, to cover the purchase price of
    some Plots
* Initial Ergs decreased from 50 to 30
* Maximum of 5 Structures per Player may be overridden by other Rules
    without requiring explicit claim of precedence
* Repeals Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits")


Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.6)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless another Rule states
      otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 25 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 25 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

      Proposal 3710 was not distributed in the form in which it was
        Proposed; Promotor Blob accidentally removed a ">".  This may
        mean that the Proposal was not distributed at all, or that it
        was distributed except for the affected clause, or that the
        text distributed by Promotor Blob takes full effect despite its
        difference from the Proposal submission.

      Murphy protoes "Fix Referenda".

      Kolja A. Proposes "Zeitgeist and scarce currencies".

      Swann Proposes "A minor Score Fix" and protoes "Non-Pejorative
        Elective Tools".

3/13  General Chaos re-protoes "The Industrial Revolution".

      Swann re-protoes "Non-Pejorative Elective Tools".

        Responsibility).

3/15  Chuck Proposes "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I".

3/16  Chuck Proposes "CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II".

      The following Proposals are distributed:
        3716 [Chuck]          CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part I
        3708 [Repeal-O-Matic] Repeal Rule 795 (Accurate Quoting Shall

        3712 [Repeal-O-Matic] Repeal Rule 1665 (Abuse of
                                Responsibility)
        3717 [Kolja A.]       Zeitgeist and scarce currencies



CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1086 [Morendil] Judgement:  FALSE
         2/23-3/6  Assigned to Harlequin, who Judges FALSE
         3/5       Harlequin commits the Infraction of Judicial
                     Inactivity by going On Hold, but remains Judge.
         "The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus,
          claimed to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly
          Proposal."

CFJ 1087 [Antimatter]
         3/9  Assigned to Morendil
         "The last sentence of Rule 1766 prevents the remainder of
          that rule from granting additional votes."

CFJ 1088 [Morendil]
         3/9  Called
         "When a Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal, and
          Votes were previously cast on such a Proposal by Entities who
          were not Senators, such Votes are nevertheless still legal
          Votes and should be taken into account for the purpose of
          determining Voting results."

All times are in GMT.

All delegations except Promotor are to avoid a bug in Rule 1486
(Procedure to Impeach an Officer), which says "Adoption Ratio is 2" and
not "Adoption Ratio must be 2 for the Referendum to pass" or similar
language.  All ten of Sherlock's Referenda to Impeach reached Quorum
and therefore passed, though none with the 2-to-1 ratio intended by the
author of Rule 1486.  This bug was worked around by postponing the
announcement of results till all ten Offices were delegated, causing
the passage of the Impeachment Referenda to have no effect.

Impeachment Referenda for Accountor, Archivist, Assessor,
  Cartographor, Chancellor, Clerk of the Courts, Commander-in-Chief,
  Scorekeepor, Speaker-Elect, and Wizard:

3/11  Speaker Steve makes this announcement:

      "If two more of the 4 currently Rebellious Players (Harlequin,
       Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent) will agree to become Abiding,
       so pushing the prospect of another Revolt further into the
       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections
       to free up some of the Offices held by the Threat, namely,
       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."

      Sherlock becomes Abiding.

      Chuck becomes Rebellious.


INTERNOMIC
----------

3/10  INP 363 is adopted.

3/12  INP 364 is submitted by New Rishonnomic.

        "A Monument to the Threat" to 4.  (Assuming that Proposal 3710
        was distributed, at least in part.)

3/13  Sherlock goes On Hold.

I fear that my life has too many other matters taking up time for me
to remain active in Agora right now.  (Starting a corporation is very
timeconsuming.)  I find that I have no idea what is going on right
now, nor do I have time to sort it all out, nor do I have the time to
fulfill the duties of whatever Offices I presently hold (on that issue
I am not even entirely certain anymore...).

If it is still necessary to do so in order to go on Hold, I hereby
move to the Stasis Chamber; if I am not already on Hold, I hereby go
on Hold.

(I will endeavour to make available any records I possess which are
necessary for the furtherance of the Game, upon request, but I do not
guarantee that I will do so with any alacrity.  Please send such
requests to me personally, as I will be reading these fora
infrequently and cursorily.  I also remind everyone of Rule 1584.)

I offer my sincere regrets for any difficulties this action may cause
(but sincerely hope that my removal from play creates a number of
interesting legal questions...).

That it seems likely to do. Scott went On Hold at Wed, 18 Mar 1998
13:06:37 -0500, just under 6 hours before the cross-Delegations which
were used to avoid the Impeachments were to have ended. At the time he
went On Hold, therefore, Scott was holding 3 Offices - Archivist,
Commander-in-Chief, and Wizard - as a Delegate. Further, he had
Delegated 3 Offices - Assessor, Scorekeepor and Chancellor - to
other Players, the first two to me and the third to Jeff. Since then,
the Periods of Delegation have all expired. So, the question is: what
is the situation now?

R1555 is clear on the Offices that Scott was holding as a Delegate.
Holding office as a Delegate is still holding Office, and R1555 states
that going On Hold removes one from every Office one holds, with the
Speaker becoming the holder of the Office. So when Scott went On Hold,
the Speaker (ie, me) became the temporary holder of the Offices of
Archivist, Commander-in-Chief and Wizard. However, as R1645 is
currently written, this did not cause the Period of Delegation to
end. At the end of the PoD, I resumed holding these Offices in the
normal fashion. This is important because it means that the 6 hour
period during which I held the Offices temporarily as Speaker did not
trigger an Election for those Offices, since they remained delegated
Offices during that period. I conclude that that I continue to hold
the Offices of Archivist, Commander-in-Chief and Wizard in the normal
fashion.

What of the Offices Delegated by Scott to Jeff and myself? Once again,
the deficiencies in R1645 mean that Scott's going On Hold did not
cause the PoDs for these Offices to conclude, so they remained with
the Delegates after Scott went On Hold. At the end of the PoD, R1645
tried to return these Offices to Scott as the Delegating Player.
However, it cannot do so because of R1584, which states that On Hold
Players cannot hold Office. R1645 does not say what happens in the
case that for some reason, the Delegating Player is no longer able to
hold Office at the end of the PoD, so the issue gets punted over to
R1006, which says that the Speaker holds these Offices. I conclude
that I am currently holding the Offices of Assessor, Chancellor and
Scorekeepor temporarily, as Speaker. Of course, the PoDs having
ended, these are now undelegated Offices being held temporarily, and
so Registrar Michael will have to hold new Elections to fill them in
the normal fashion.

In the meantime, I find myself holding 3 fairly demanding Offices.
I am not at all sure I have the time at the moment to fulfil the
duties associated with them. I therefore resign the Office of
Scorekeepor, appointing Swann as my successor, and I resign as
Chancellor, appointing elJefe as my successor. I'll hang on to
Assessor at least long enough to issue as Assessor's Report,
then see how things stand.
