Given that this statement has been judged true, I must admit that my
Assessor's Report dated April 19 is in error insofar as it stated that
Elysion ABSTAINED on P3853. In fact, he did not make a valid vote.
This does not affect the outcome of the vote.

It does mean, however, that I should vacate the PO:

avt142  Elysion        Bank       1.0  VTs       Voting

and declare that Elysion is guilty of Failing to Vote on that batch
of proposals. So issue two new POs:

avt151  Elysion        Bank       1.0  VTs       Failing to Vote
ain012  Elysion        Bank       1.0  Indulg    Failing to Vote

Michael,

I note that "Separation of Powers" is still shown as being in the Proposal
Queue. It should have been removed when Steve adopted it summarily. 
(I can find no legal basis to contest that he did so successfully.)

You're right, I missed this.  Thanks for checking my report.  I admit
the COE.  The report now includes:
