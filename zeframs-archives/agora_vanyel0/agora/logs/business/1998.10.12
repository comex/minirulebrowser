As per a previous message to Murphy, I did actually nominate for this;
and I have a log of the message I sent.

However, it would seem that you are pretty much required to start a
new Election by the current rules because I am still only in the
Office temporarily, and there is no election current because even if
there was one, I don't get to fill the post until Murphy announces
that I won it. 

No, actually, I see now that this is probably wrong.  It seems much
more sensible to assume that an election doesn't finish until its
result is announced, so the election for which I nominated on 27
September is current until Murphy says that I've won it. 

Any other views?

Michael.
