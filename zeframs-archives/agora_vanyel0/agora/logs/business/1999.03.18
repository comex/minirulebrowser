This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Merit" and is to have Adoption
Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has a Merit Rating, an integer, which may be
          positive, negative, or zero.  Until the Rules act to give a
          Player some other Merit Rating, a Player's Merit Rating is
          zero.  Merit Ratings shall be changed only when authorized
          by the Rules.

      (b) The Office of the Secretary is hereby established.
        (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of the Merit Rating
            of every Player.
        (2) The Secretary's Report shall include:
          (A) a schedule setting forth the Merit Rating of each
              Player; and
          (B) a description of all changes made to the Merit Rating of
              any Player since the last such Report.
        (3) The Secretary shall receive a salary equal to one and
            one-half times the Basic Officer Salary.

      (c) When an entitlement is to be randomly distributed to the
          Players, the Officer making the distribution shall use the
          following procedure (or any other procedure which results in
          each Player having the same probability of receiving the
          entitlement as e would under the following procedure):
        (1) The Officer shall, for each Player, place in a bin one
            hundred tokens bearing the name of that Player, in each
            case augmenting or diminishing that number by that
            Player's Merit Rating.  (If a Player's Merit Rating is
            less than negative one hundred, then no tokens are placed
            in the bin.)
        (2) The Officer shall then draw one token from the bin, and
            award the entitlement to the Player whose name is on the
            token.

      (d) When making a distribution the procedure described in
          subdivision (c), the Officer shall use the Merit Ratings of
          the Players reported in the most recent uncontested
          Secretary's Report, and no other.  A distribution made based
          on Merit Ratings as required by this subdivision is valid
          notwithstanding any error in the Secretary's Report which
          may later become apparent.
        (1) If the most recent uncontested Secretary's Report is more
            than twenty-one days old, the Officer may elect to delay
            the distribution until a new Report is made.  If the
            Officer elects to delay a distribution, e must announce in
            the Public Forum that e has elected to do so.
        (2) If there has never been an uncontested Secretary's Report,
            the Officer shall proceed on the assumption that every
            Player has a Merit Rating of zero.

I hereby change the Priority Bar to 1.7 P-Notes.

This change will be effective on Monday, in accordance with Rule
1881(d).

(This change is intended to reduce the P-Note bleed being casued by
the large proportions of Proposals that pass.  My records show that
approximately 80% of recent Proposals have passed.)

Except that they can't hoard Voting Tokens; the VT Tax will get them.
My intent is to increase demand for P-Notes amongst people who want to 
spend them (but don't have them) so that they will trade with the
people who are hoarding them (and, I should note, making little or no
use of them).  Either they'll trade VTs, resulting in the hoarders
being taxed, or they'll trade favors.  If I lowered the Priority Bar,
I'd be eliminating competitive pressures, which I think are
desirable.

In order to further increase competitiveness in the Proposal Queue, I
hereby reduce the Batch Size to two, effective next week.

I have other motives for a high Priority Bar, some of which may become 
apparent over the following weeks.
