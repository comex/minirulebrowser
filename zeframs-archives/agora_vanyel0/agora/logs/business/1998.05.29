PROTO: Order Repair v2.0 (this proposal shall have AI=3)
------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Barring further comment, this will be the fix I Propose.
      With the addition of one scam-related rule :)

PART I: Orders in general
==================================================================

Rule 1793 is amended to read as follows;

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity.  It is a non-Rule entity given coercive power by other
      Rules.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

{Comment: The language about either multiple prohibitions, or one single
          act, is needlessly constraining-- and raises some bizarre 
          problems when considering possible amendments.  It makes more 
          sense to treat them as unitary bodies of text with coercive 
          power, like a Rule, that can contain multiple provisions as 
          the situation dictates.  In the case of Orders defined by the 
          Rules, (TO's PO's &c.) there's already reasonable restriction 
          on their content.}


Let the following rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Automatically Invalid Orders)

     An Order shall be invalidated upon its execution if any of the 
     following is true of it;

       i) It seeks to hinder the appeal of itself or some other Order
      ii) It seeks to hinder the stay, vacation or amendment of itself,
          either directly, or indirectly through hindering the stay,
          vacation or amendment of another Order.
     iii) The Order itself is in direct violation of one or more Rules.
      iv) It seeks to compel, or forbid, the performance of any duty
          required or permitted of a Player solely in virtue of that
          Player being a Judge or Justice.
       v) It seeks to forbid any Player from submitting a CFJ, appealing
          a CFJ, or submitting a Motion.

{Comment: Fixed ii) to allow Orders to hinder the operation of other
          Orders, if that hindering still permits the stay, vacation &c. 
          of the Order in question.}


Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Precedence and Authority of Orders)

     Orders are non-Rule entities with coercive power granted by this
     Rule.  If there is a conflict between Orders of different classes,
     the following precedence relations shall hold if no other Rule
     explicitly applying to those Orders specifies otherwise. If another
     Rule explicitly states that an Order executed by a particular
     Player in a particular circumstance shall take precedence over--
     or defer to-- another Order, then that method of precedence shall 
     govern first.

     Otherwise, Orders have precedence in relation to their class as 
     follows;

       i) Administrative Orders have precedence over Private Orders.
      ii) Judicial Orders have precedence over Administrative Orders and 
          Private Orders.
     iii) Appellate Orders have precedence over all other Orders.
      iv) Between Orders of the same class, the Order that was most
          recently executed or amended shall take precedence.

     The following shall always apply to any Order, other Rules
     notwithstanding;

     An Order can only affect another Order when the Order affected 
     does not take precedence over it. An Order that attempts to do so 
     is invalidated upon execution.

     No Order can forbid or hinder a Player from executing an Order
     of equal or higher precedence.  An Order that attempts to do so is 
     invalidated upon execution.

     This Rule takes precedence over other Rules defining the precedence 
     of non-Rule Entities that don't apply solely to Orders.

{Comment: Revised this to allow stays upon appeal, and to treat Orders
          as NREs, with a twist.  In order for vacation and such to be
          effective, I have reversed the "normal" precedence for NREs, 
          with later-executed Orders taking precedence.  I think this 
          makes sense given the nature of Orders, which are more 
          transitory than Rules or SLCs.
          
          Redid this to allow specific rules to revise precedence
          relations of specific Orders.}


Rule 1796 is amended to read as follows;

      All Administrative, Judicial, and Appellate Orders executed in the
      manner prescribed by the Rules are presumed valid and enforceable 
      until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      Any Private Order that is of a type not explicitly permitted by
      the Rules, or is not pursuant to an agreement between the Player
      issuing it and the entity to which the Order is directed, or is
      not affecting such an Order, is presumptively invalid until proven 
      otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must;

        i) Permit the Player who executed the Order in question to 
           execute such an Order.

       ii) Require or permit the execution of the Order in the 
           circumstances which existed at the time it was executed.

      iii) Not explicitly render it invalid.

{Comment: Loosened the reigns on private Orders to allow for Player
          agreements, removed the "class and type" language.
          Permitted Orders pursuant to agreements by players.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Definition of Improper for Orders)

     An Order shall be improperly executed when it fails to conform to 
     the procedures defined in the Rules for the execution of an Order, 
     or if its content fails to conform to the strictures provided in 
     the Rules for the content of an Order.

     An Order shall be for an improper purpose if it does not conform to 
     the purpose of such an Order as broadly defined in the Rules.  The 
     following shall be the minimum considerations for determining the 
     proper purpose for each class of Order;

       i) Private Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to the personal business of the Player 
          issuing them, or to the business of entities of which that
          Player is an Executor, or are persuant to a binding agreement
          betwen the Player issuing the Order and the entity being so
          Ordered.
      ii) Administrative Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless 
          they are directly relevant to the performance of the official 
          duties of the Player issuing them.
     iii) Judicial Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to a CFJ currently being Judged by the
          Player issuing them.
      iv) Appellate Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to an issue that Board is currently 
          adjudicating.

     Orders which are improperly executed, or for an improper purpose, 
     are invalid.

     Orders that are improperly executed, for an improper purpose, or
     are otherwise invalid, are defined as improper Orders.  A proper 
     Order is any Order that is not improper.

{Comment: Rewrote i) after some suggestions.}


Rule 1800 is amended by appending the following paragraph;

     "If an Amendment to a valid Order would render it invalid, then the 
      Order to make that Amendment is itself invalid.

{Comment: IMHO this makes sense, because otherwise it would be possible
          to get around legal Orders by amending them into invalidity, 
          which I don't think should be possible.


PART II: Orders and the Courts
=======================================================================
Rule 1809 is amended to read as follows;

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ whose Statement alleges that the Order is improper.  (i.e.
      invalid, improperly executed, or for an improper purpose.)

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidity executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidity
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  This Order to stay shall take precedence over the Order
      in dispute. If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

{Comment: This is a better solution IMO than my prior attempt.  It 
          allows us to have a precedence of Orders, but allows special 
          cases, like the above, when we would want to grant an order 
          precedence beyond what is normal.  (The Judge doesn't need a 
          clause, since the only Order eir Order doesn't take precedence 
          over are Appellate Orders.}


Rule 217 is amended to read;

      All Judgements, and Judicial Orders, must be in accordance with
      the Rules; however, if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or 
      unclear on the Statement to be Judged, or the Order to be issued, 
      then the Judge shall consider game custom, commonsense, past
      Judgements, past Judicial Orders in similar curcumstances, 
      and the best interests of the game before applying other 
      standards.

{Comment: This gives the same standards to Judicial Orders that apply to
          Judgements.}


Rule 1804 is amended to read;

     Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
     Call for Appeal.

     If not specified elsewhere, the insistence of three Players, or the 
     insistence of the Player subject to the Order, to the Public Forum, 
     shall be sufficient to call for this Appeal.

     The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
     improper (i.e. invalid, improperly executed, or for an improper 
     purpose), amend or vacate the Order, as it deems appropriate.

     When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
     for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
     stay the Order under appeal.  This Order to stay shall take
     precedence over the Order under appeal. If the Board of Appeals 
     affirms the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate 
     this stay.

{Comment: See the amendment of 1809.  BTW, both of these use the
          new definition of improper I introduced.}


Rule 1827 is amended to read;

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      In any case, the Judge shall deny any Motion that would require
      eim to make an improper Order, is not directly relevant to the 
      CFJ to which it applies, or would require em to act in violation
      of any Rule.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      the determination made and the reasons, if any, on the record of
      the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the Motion of that
      determination.

{Comment: Currently it is perfectly all right for a Motion to be issued
          that directly bribes a judge to grant itself (I was 
          considering, as an alternative response to the Counter-
          Revolution, submitting a motion requesting a Judge-- notably 
          P-Note poor-- to pay out to emself five P-Notes and vacate all 
          of Macross' Orders), and it currently need not have anything 
          to do with the CFJ in question.}

Rule 1830 is repealed

{Comment:  The first part is taken over by the stronger Rule above, and 
           the other class can be added to the dismissal Rule.}

Rule 1565 is amended by changing the text;

      " i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement."

To read as follows;


      " i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.
      vii) Its statement alleges that a Judge or Justice has failed to
           perform a duty of a judicial nature.  (Such issues are for
           appeal to the Board of Appeals, as specified in other Rules.)

{Comment:  Added the reason for this new clause in the interest of
           clarity.}


Rule 1806 is amended to read;

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
      accompanied by that false certification. This Order to vacate
      shall take precedence over the falsely certified Order.


Rule 1807 is amended to read;

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid if and only if addressed to:
        i) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
       ii) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
      iii) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
       iv) any combination of the above.

      All other Appellate Orders are improper and presumptively invalid.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.


Rule 1695 is amended to read as follows;

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was proper, valid, and if it
      was appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made properly, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was improper, invalid, or that
      it was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Part III: New Concepts and restrictions
======================================================================

Rule 1810 and 1811 are hereby repealed.

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Definition of Fufilled, Satisfied, and Defied Orders)

     An Order shall be Fulfilled when all actions required of the entity 
     so Ordered are performed by that entity.

     An Order shall be Defied when any action an entity is required by 
     the Order to refrain from is performed by that entity.

     An Order shall be Satisfied when it is Fulfilled, and that Order 
     does not require the Ordered entity to refrain from any action.  If 
     an Order can be Defied, it cannot be Satisfied.


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: No Multiple Fulfillments)

     No single action by any entity can be used to Fulfill the 
     requirements of more than one Order unless the rules state 
     explicitly otherwise in the circumstances in which the entity 
     performs the action.  This Rule take precedence over Rules that 
     contradict its provisions.


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Penalties for Contempt)

     There is a Crime of Contempt by Action, a Class C Crime.  This 
     Crime is committed when an entity Defies an Order.

     There is a Crime of Contempt by Inaction, a Class C Crime.  This 
     Crime is committed when an entity, when required by an Order to 
     perform an action, fails to perform that action within the time 
     required of it by the Rules.  If the Order has been Fulfilled, that
     shall be a complete defense against this Crime.

     This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
     which has been adjudicated to be improper, and the impropriety of
     the Order is a complete defense to any Criminal accusation made
     under this Rule.

Rule 1802 shall be amended to read;

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.
      Vacating an Order that requires action from an entity shall not
      have the effect of reversing any actions performed by that entity
      to Fufill that Order. Vacating an Order that has been Satisfied 
      shall have no effect.

{Comment: This is starting to address Michael's loophole.}

Let the follwoing Rule be created;
(Title: Judical Redress for improper Orders)

     If a Judge finds that an Order was improper, and the entity so 
     Ordered has acted to Fulfill, in whole, or in part, the improper 
     Order, the Judge shall issue an Order to reverse, insofar as is 
     possible, those actions performed by that entity that the Rules do
     not provide reversal for by other means. However, e shall only
     issue such an Order if it does no further harm.

{Comment: This replaces 1818 as far as old TO's goes.  If you need to
          deal with a vacated TO over a month old, take it to the 
          courts.}


Part IV: Currency
======================================================================


Rule 1818 is amended to read as follows;

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is vacated within one week of its issuance, e shall 
      execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that would have 
      the effect of reversing the original Transfer Order.

{Comment: This smoothes out the oddball handling of vacated TO's as well
          as putting a statute of limitations on vacations the 
          Recordkeepor needs to note.  If a problem occurs in an older 
          TO, that's when Judicial redress comes into play.  See the 
          above Rules..}
