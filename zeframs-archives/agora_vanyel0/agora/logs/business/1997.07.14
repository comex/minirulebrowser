Sigh. It was recently drawn to my attention that in addition to not
receiving Salaries, Officers who fail to produce weekly Reports also
commit the Infraction of Failure to Report, and incur penalties as
for a Class D Crime. I don't much like being Agroa's policeman, but
although I don't *have* to report these Infractions, now that I know
they're there, I feel uncomfortable just ignoring them. So, I hereby
report that the following Players committed the Infraction of Failure
to Report, and incur penalties of 2 Blots and 2 VTs for each such
Infraction:

Harlequin failed to produce either a Mad Scientist's Report, or a
Cartographor's Report (so he commits the Infraction twice).

General Chaos failed to produce a Wizard's Report.

Registrar Steve
