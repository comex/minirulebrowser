H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Urgent Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to make
it an Urgent Proposal, and 2 further P-Notes to raise its Priority to 2:

####
Proposal
We Need a Holiday

Be it therefore resolved a Rule, entitled "Merry Christmas, Agora"
be created with the following text:

      The period commencing every year at midnight GMT December 25, and
      concluding at midnight GMT January 1 is a Holiday.

(I'd have made it January 2, but that would make it an 8-day Holiday,
which is disallowed by R1769.)

If this is adopted, it'll take effect after midnight GMT December 25,
which will take us into by now familiar territory concerning when the
Holiday starts, if it does at all.
