Proposal:

That the text of Rule 1586/1 (Power=1) "Definition and Continuity of
Entities" be replaced with the following text.

    "This text was left by Jester as a memory."


And that Rule 1586/1 (Power=1) "Definition and Continuity of Entities"
not be repealed.

[Please vote against this, I would like to see how the legalities of an
Anti-Proposal resolve themselves.]

Proto-Proposal: Risky Rebellion

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to the 
      Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only effective
      if the following conditions are met:

         i) The player posting the Call is Rebellious,
        ii) No other effective Call for Revolt has been made that week,
       iii) A successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds,
      as outlined below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - The Registrar shall vacate all Blots of each Rebellious 
           Player.
         - The Registrar shall pay out 2 VTs to each Rebellious Player.

         - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional) Blots

      The Registrar shall execute any payment orders required by this
      rule.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.

[v1.0 The aim is to make Rebellion a bit more risky, but also to set 
      penalties so that if a Revolt does take place, you'd rather be
      on the winning side.]
[v1.1 fixed some language, added reporting requirement]
[v2.0 added Blot penalties & Patent Title]
[v2.1 toned down some of the rewards & penalties]
[v2.2 Added some language modifications suggested by Murphy]
[v2.3 Removed "At the time this Rule is created..." sentence]
[v2.4 Fiddled with the penalties again.]
[v3.0 Removed the penalty for Abiding Players, and changed the reward to 3 EVs]
[v3.1 Removed vague language about determining the result of the Revolt]
[v3.2 Changed to reflect new Agoraspace & Indulgences rules.]
[v4.0 Change to reflect Pragmatic currencies & prevent multiple Revolts]

Wait a second--I'm supposed to be the sleuth here! ;)

I played Nomic World for a few weeks; unfortunately I had joined right
near its end.  I recognized several of the Players' names here when I
was shopping around for Nomics to join, but none of them were people I
had talked to on Nomic World.  So, for what it's worth, yes, I was a
Player there.

For his extraordinary skills as a detective, I bestow on him a "Baker
Street Bonus", that is to say, in less interesting words, I hereby transfer 
1 Indulgence to Oerjan.

I will also offer 1 Indulgence to the first Player who mails the
Public Forum a message containing the author and title of the fairly poor 
series that featured a character named "Ganelon".

     He was a character in Roger Zelazny's Amber series.

I hereby tranfer 1 Indulgence to Time Agent, for his knowledge of
second-rate sci-fi/fantasy. ;)

Well, Ganelon was a pseudonym used by King Oberon on Roger Zelazny's
"Nine Princes in Amber" books, but I'm not sure if that series
deserves the appelation of "fairly poor".
