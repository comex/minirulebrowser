I hereby submit the following proposal, and spend 1 P-Note to raise its
Priority to 1.

----

Proposal: 
Modes of Voting

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing
      mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals, with Support. 

       (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections, with Support. 

       (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

       (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.

 v1.1 - Modified it to use the new "With Support" rule. Removed the
        clause describing timing, as that is covered by "With Support"
        (albeit in a different way).

        I am in the process of bringing the numbering in line with
        Gen Chaos' standard, but I've lost the message in which he
        described it. 

        Removed the final clause as it didn't seem to have any real
        purpose.

H. Promotor, please note:

Being required to serve, I submit the following proposal, delimited by
lines of 70 hyphens at either end:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
That Rule 1854 ("The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary") be
amended to read:

The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary by first announcing
that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that e announces a
value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive.  The change to the Basic
Officer Salary then occurs at the beginning of the next week if the
announcement was made on a Thursday or earlier in the week.  If the
announcement is made later in the week, then the change occurs at the
start of the second week after the announcement. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comment: As I left to go on holiday, the unnecessary restrictiveness
of this rule as it stands now was discussed.  I think it's perfectly
reasonable, whether or not salaries are paid on a monthly or a weekly
basis, to let the Chancellor announce changes whenever they want.
With a suitable delay, the Chancellor shouldn't be able to cause the
rest of the populace any nasty surprises.

Promotor, I hereby transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank to raise the priority
of the above Proposal.

Michael.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Standards of Proof" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

Hi all,

I'm preparing for a period transition (moving, starting in a new job
etc), so I'll soon be unsubscirbing from a-d for some time. I'm not
sure when I'll have everyday eMail access again, so to be on the safe
side:

I hereby give Steve Power of Attorney to conduct my business,
according to R1841 and 1842. I do so for the time period of noon
(GMT), 1st February 1999 to noon (GMT), 30 April 1999 (If I'm back
earlier, I can always revoke it...)

Steve, don't forget that you have to consent to this in the PF before
the starting time on 1 Feb.

I hope this will not only allow Steve to do everyday business for me,
but also lead to some interesting situations trying out this new
aspect of the rules for the first time (at least over a longer period
of time). So I explicitly encourage everyone to try and use this time
to explore the Attorney rules, and tamper around with what is possible
and what isn't. I do hope that there are no bugs waiting that will get
me deregistered, or bankrupt, or something similarly nasty. But to be
honest, I'd rather see one of these bad things happen after a good
discussion, interesting CFJs etc, than just watch everyday business...

Kolja A.

PROTO
Upmutate Rule 1814, version 1

This Proposal shall have Adoption Index 3.

Rule 1814 is Amended to read

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

      However, the punishment for a Crime or Infraction may be
      completely set aside by a Rule explicitly granting Amnesty.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies a
      different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.

The Power of Rule 1814 is set to 3.

[This Rule is an important enough safeguard that it deserves higher
Power.  I have inserted a provision for Amnesty.]
