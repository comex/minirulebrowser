Proto-Proposal: Non-Pejorative Elective Tools.

PART ONE--- The Speaker

Rule 1660 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1659 is amended by replacing each instance of the word "Tainted"
with the phrase "in Transition."

Rule 1661 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1648 has its title change to, "When the Speaker is in Transition."
Rule 1648 is amended by replacing each instance of the phrase "Speaker
is Tainted" with the phrase "Speaker is in Transition," and replacing
the phrase "A Tainted Speaker," with the phrase, "A Speaker in
Transition."

Rule 1658 has its title change to, "Calling for a Speaker Transition."
Rule 1658 is amended to read as follows;

      A Speaker shall be forced into Transition when a Referendum
      calling for a Speaker Transition passes. Any Active Player is 
      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting 
      such to the Public Forum.

      If this Referendum passes, and a Speaker Transition has not
      occurred since the Referendum was called, then the Speaker shall
      be placed in Transition upon the announcement of the Referendum's 
      results.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and the Adoption Ratio
      required for passage is 2.

{Comment: There is a pejorative cast to the word Tainted, this replaces
          the term with the more neutral "in Transition."  Rule 1658 is 
          rewritten to remove some other pejorative language "such as 
          offending Speaker."  With this redone, there should be less of 
          a moral cast to this whole process, allowing more political 
          use of the process. Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}


PART TWO--- The Officers

Rule 1486 has its title change to, "Public Calls for Elections."
Rule 1486 is amended to read as follows;

     Any Active Player is permitted call a Referendum known as a Public 
     Call for Elections.  This is done by requesting such a Referendum
     in the Public Forum.  Such a call must list one or more Offices 
     that are subject to this Public Call for Elections.  Upon passage 
     of this Referendum, any player holding a listed Office that has
     not been filled by an election since the Referendum was called
     shall be retired from that Office.

     For a Public Call for Elections the default procedure for referenda
     is modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum.

     Such a Referendum can be declared a Call for Impeachment.  Such a 
     call must be clearly identified as such, can only list one Office, 
     and must identify the Player holding the listed Office.  If
     that Player still holds the Office upon passage of the Call for 
     Impeachment, e shall be removed from the listed Office.

     For a Call for Impeachment, the default procedure for referenda is
     modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum, Voting Entities do not include the Officer under 
     consideration for Impeachment, and the Adoption Ratio required
     for passage is 2.

{Comment: Created a less offensive way for the public to wield some
          power vs. Officers.  It gives the Players the Speaker-like 
          right to call elections (should they gain a majority
support.)           I retained impeachment as impeachment, since there
should 
          be a means of emergency Officer removal if someone is truly
          damaging the game.  (The former only forces an election, the 
          latter boots the person out of Office, dumping it on the 
          Speaker.)  Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}

Well, after a week of straight typing papers, essays and my thesis, 
Spring Break has finally arrived to free my spirits.  I will not be at
a terminal until March 22nd at the earliest, and so...

I hereby move to the Stasis Chamber.

Have a good week, everyone!
