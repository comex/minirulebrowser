H. Cartographor, Registrar and whoever else this may concern, please
note: 

I hereby move to the Stasis Chamber and go on hold.

(One week physics conference - I wonder whether you'll have made the
voting procedure workable again when I come back... to be honest, I
doubt it ;)

H. Registrar, please note:

I hereby nominate for the office of Ambassador, because Internomic and
the idea of a game that is played by games instead of people was one
of the things that made me want to play Agora, so I'd like to do more
in that direction.

My understanding of the current Currency uncertainties is that while the
actual number of Blots around is in dispute, there is little if any chance
that anyone has much less Blots than what the Herald has reported.

Therefore, I believe that I should be safe from accusations of Persecution
due to what follows. I just hope I won't have to eat my words. :-)

The latest Herald's Report recorded Elde as having 25 Blots. Since then,
he has committed 5 Infractions of failing to Judge. So, if I have done my
research correctly, he now "officially" has 25 + 5*3 = 40 Blots. 

As I said above, there is little chance that he has much less. In
particular, he certainly has more than 30 Blots. 

I hereby allege that Elde is Lawless. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

You might want to correct the CFJ number. This is a COE.
