Having only been elected to the Cartographor-ship on the 10th of July,
you are not eligible for the salary for the week ending on the 12th.  

I hereby vacate payment orders RVTPO448 and RVTPO472. 

I hereby order the Bank to pay Steve 0.8 VTs (RVTPO493) as his salary
for Cartographor for the week ending 19 July 1998.

I also order the Scorekeepor to note that Steve gains three points for
becoming the Speaker. 

Michael.

This Week with R-O-M

There really are 352 Rules now that Chuck's PO vacations have really happened.

This selection this week is:

204 = Rule 1502 The Nomic Phone Books
 51 = Rule 1758 Holding an Office in Perpetuity
 44 = Rule 1431 Claims of Error
  6 = Rule  754 Spelling and Grammar Errors
103 = Rule  683 Voting on Proposals

Hmm, well maybe the R-O-M can't get rid of a White Elephant this week, but it
might get rid of some White Pages.  I'll select Rule 1502.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1502 (The Nomic Phone Books)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1502 is hereby Repealed.

Claim of Error:  That should have been three new Proposals;  the batch

In light of my criticisms of CotC Michael's method of Judge reselection in
CFJ 1100, and of Kolja's Judgement of CFJ 1101, I hereby claim that
Michael's method of Judge selection in both these CFJs was illegal in
that it did not satisfy R1079. In both CFJs, every Active Player who
neither barred nor was the Caller of the CFJ was eligible to be selected
as a Judge. I request that Michael use the standard method to determine
if new Judges should be selected to Judge these CFJs (especially the
first, CFJ 1100; I accept that there are special paradoxical problems in
performing a reselection for the second.)

   3778 Swann          1 Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's 
   3779 Blob           1 Skimming a bit off the top.
   3780 Steve          1 Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

======================================================================
Proposal 3778 (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional-- ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

======================================================================
Proposal 3779 (Blob) AI = 1
Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

======================================================================
Proposal 3780 (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: The secret voting experiment seems to be working reasonably
well. I'd like to extend it another two months. Note that this quite
independent of the issue of Presence.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by Vote
Collectors), 1625 (Secrecy of Votes) and 1764 (Public Voting) each be
amended by appending to them a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that R1859 (Secret Voting), be amended by
replacing in it the paragraph which currently reads:

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

with a paragraph which reads:

      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this Rule
      repeals itself.

Claim of Error:  That should have been three new Proposals;  the batch
size must be changed the Week _before_ it is used.
