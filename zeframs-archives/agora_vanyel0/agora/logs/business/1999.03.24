Elysion,

I confirm that the above statement is correct with respect
to VTs and Indulgences.  As High Priest of the OEE, I also
inform you that macross has no Irises.  Let me know if you
need a list of specific POs for macross and I'll send them
to you directly.  Of course, they are in the latest Accountor
and Herald Reports, if you still have those.
