This Week with R-O-M

Still 342 Rules by my count.  Here are the five random picks this week:

 21 = Rule  114 Rules Can Always Be Changed
315 = Rule 1759 Organizational Payment Orders
283 = Rule 1778 Initiating an Endgame Procedure
153 = Rule 1568 Judges On Hold
 80 = Rule 1770 Distributing Proposals

I feel a slight temptation for Rule 114 8), but I'd vote against it myself, and
I doubt if anyone really would want that.  The others aren't very exciting, but
I will select Rule 1568.  Let's see if Players are willing to let Judges opt
out without penalty.  I'll amend 1567 to remove the penalty there too, for
consistency.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1568 (Judges On Hold)
          This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1568 is hereby Repealed.
Rule 1567 is amended by replacing the text:

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge of that
      CFJ.

with the text:

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall recuse that Player as the
      Judge of that CFJ.
