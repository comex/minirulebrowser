I hereby transfer one Kudo from myself (because I don't have anyone else
to deKudo at the moment) to Steve (for being the first to publically notice
that I'm not actually a member of the Order any more).  And, for the record,
I don't have any formal alliance whatsoever with the Order, other than a
personal decision to support their candidates this round.
