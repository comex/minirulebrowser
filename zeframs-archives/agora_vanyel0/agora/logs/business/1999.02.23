Well, it's almost the end of February, and I haven't seen any
other nominations or witnessed any more deserving acts (IMO),
so, as allowed by R1872, I hereby award a Kudo to Oerjan

This CFJ is essentially the inverse of CFJ 1119 and I hereby enter a judgement
of TRUE.  I quote my reasoning from the appeal of CFJ 1119 to support
this judgement:

"...because the PoA Rules allow the grantor to revoke
PoA at any time, without warning or restriction, there is never a time during which the grantor
is actually unable to make use of eir assets, if e so desires.  It is this judges opinion that
such an ability amounts to continuous "effective control" over the assets in question."

I hereby vote to overturn the above judgement and return a judgement of FALSE for CFJ 1119.

At first blush, the original judgement seems reasonable, since granting PoA to another Player
does indeed technically deprive the grantor of the ability to make Transfer Orders for the
duration of the granting.  However, because the PoA Rules allow the grantor to revoke
PoA at any time, without warning or restriction, there is never a time during the the grantor
is actually unable to make use of eir assets, if e so desires.  It is this judges opinion that
such an ability amounts to continuous "effective control" over the assets in question.

This means that Kolja did indeed incur a Duty to Vote on Proposals 3829-3830 and the
original penalty assessment was valid.  Since these penalties were vacated by the
original Judge, it appears to be my duty as Justiciar and Lead Justice for the Appeal
to issue Appellate Orders reinstating these penalties, as long as one or both of my
fellow appellate justices concur with this finding and certify that these orders should
be issued.

Proto: Variable Unemployment Benefits

Amend Rule 1858 to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit.

      The value of the unemployment benefit is a proportion of the
      Basic Officer Salary, the same for all Players. It can be set 
      by the Registrar by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing
      so, provided that e announces a value between 0% and 100% inclusive
      in units of 10%, and that e makes the announcement before the 25th
      day of the month.
