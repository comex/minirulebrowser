H. Promotor,

I hereby retract the proposal with the title "Monthly salaries" which
I submitted a few days ago. Instead, I submit the following proposal:


Monthly salaries


Amend the first paragraph of R1007 to read

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Player the designated Salary for each Office that
      Player has held for a total of at least 12 days in the 
      preceding month.


Amend R1858 to read

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit
      of half the Basic Officer Salary.


Amend 1854 to read

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.
