Boy,  what a week for me to be up to my ass in alligators.  Well, here's my two cents
on this latest development.

First, I think the calls for banishment, permanent or temporary, are over the top.
Steve obviously had strong feelings about Summary Adoption and e also clearly
used restraint in perpetrating eir scam.  These things should be taken into account.

OTOH, e did abuse eir position as a list administrator in order to perpetrate this scam.
To me this is particularly serious because that position is not equally available to all
Players.  If an Officer abuses eir powers, at least all Players had the opportunity
to run for that Office.  This is not true for a list administrator, which is, if you will, a
"meta-game" position of trust.

But what is fitting punishment?  Clearly, the prosecution of any possible Crimes
should be carried out to the letter of the law in this case.  And I expect Steve
is and was willing to accept the consequences of eir actions in this regard.
But there is another, and I would have thought obvious, penalty.  Steve has
conducted emself as one of the most honorable of Players up to this point
and eir Kudo status reflects this.  But eir serious breach of meta-game trust
probably should result in eir loss of Samurai, and especially Shogun status.

In the past, Kudos would already have been flying for such a controversial
move (as Morendil can well testify).  I am sorry to see such draconian
measures as banishment being called for instead.  So, let me set an
example here.  Let the Kudos fly, prosecute any Crimes, and let's get
on with a gentalspivakly game, please.

I hereby transfer a Kudo from Steve, for eir serious abuse of trust
as a list administrator, to Peekee for speaking up so strongly against
the use of personal invective and in favor of civility in our discussions.

I vote AGAINST this referendum. Steve has in no way abused his capacity
as CotC, and I for one trust that he will not, even if it might be in
his better interests. Steve in a veteran scamster and he knows when to 
rock the boat and when not to. Pulling off a scam is one thing, hindering
a valid resolution during the aftermath is something else entirely. I
think we can trust Steve to know the difference.
