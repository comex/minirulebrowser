I think this may be worth another look. I join the Appeal.

Just a reminder: Read the Ruleset Week has now begun.

The Ruleset is the heart of Agora, but too often,
we find ourselves surprised by what it contains.  The
Agoran populace has thus seen fit to designate one week
each year as Read the Ruleset Week.  Surely once a year is
not too frequent for each Player to read the entire Ruleset!

I urge everyone to find the time--*make* the time--this
week to read the entire Ruleset, in either format.  Go at
it with a purpose in mind, if you like.  Look for areas to
improve.  Look for scams.  Or just read it for your information.

In order to encourage reading the Ruleset, I will transfer
1 P-Note each to the first five Players who confirm, in the PF,
that they have read the text of every Rule this Week.  (Myself excluded.)
Claims must be made by the end of this Week to receive the award.
While I have no way of confirming such claims, I will trust
Players to be honest.

I have just posted the Ruleset in both forms (although I have not
seend the FLR come back to me, yet).  The FLR and SLR are
also available through my rules page, 
<http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/>.  Also available there
is a Numerical Ruleset, in case anyone prefers that form, and I
am of course willing to send a Numerical Ruleset to anyone who wants
one.

Finally, if you are completely unable to find the time to read the
Ruleset this Week, I urge you not to just wait until this time
next year, but to read the Ruleset at the earliest opportunity.

Chuck
