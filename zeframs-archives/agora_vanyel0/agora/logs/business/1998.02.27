I claim that the post of the Short Logical Ruleset dated 21 Feb 98 is in
error.

It did not have the Rule titled LET JESTER BE FE'TED.

The voting report shows that P3690 did not get the required number of
votes nor did it achieve Quorum.

> SI 3690 Jester           2 (none)                      F/Q    1-1-0-1

Rule 106 states;

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.The Proposal
stated;

> LET NOT THIS RULE BE CREATED:

If this Rule has not been created then the Proposal has been adopted. We
know that the Proposal was not adopted therefore the Rule must be created.

Here is the full Proposal again.

I don't know if this is the correct form to use or not, but here goes.

In the event of my de-registration from the game and my 'estate' needing
to be distributed I desire that all of my transferable items be
transferred to the most recently registered new (not re-registered)
player.

I call for the appeal of the Injunction in CFJ 1084;  Rule 1504 clearly
specifies that the Judge shall injunct the _Clerk of the Courts_ to
_vacate_ the penalty PO, not injunct the Registrar to reverse it. 

Sheesh.

I would have called for also appending the proper injunction, except that
(1) this is only allowed when there was no injunction in the first place,
and (2) appeals to append Injunctions are disallowed due to a bug in Rule
1564.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I join this appeal, noting only that the proper term is "enjoin", not
"injunct".

Reminiscent of Luke 16. Very shrewd. I commend you.

H. Herald, 

I hereby issue a Kudo transfer from myself (Blob) to Crito for 
being an excellent Promotor, for putting up a good fight, and for
stepping down honourably. 

Crito, I salute you.

Blob

H Herald,

I hereby transfer one Kudo:

FROM Gen. Chaos, because he rudely condemned Jester's attempt at 
loophole surfing apparently without attempting to fully comprehend it.

TO Morendil, for his diligence and insight as a Justice in several 
recent appeals.

Blob

I note that Blob errs in alleging that I did not "[attempt] to fully
comprehend" Jester's argument; on the contrary, I did in fact fully
comprehend it, and found it lacking.  I thereby transfer one Kudo from
Blob for jumping to conclusions, to Jester, so as to make up for my
rather frank dismissal of his argument.
