Denied.  Rule 1047 restricts the award of the Zeitgeist Title to
Interested Proposals.

This Week with R-O-M

292 Rules this week, and my random number generator spit out:

 58 = Rule 1007 Salaries of Officers      - I doubt if this will fly.
291 = Rule 1651 The Silly Proposal        - Hmm. Maybe.
148 = Rule 1694 Appeal of a Dismissal     - I don't like messing with appeals.
128 = Rule 1575 Standards of Proof        - Why is the last paragraph there
                                            twice?
278 = Rule 1377 The Herald                - I don't think so. 8)


Well, I kind of like the Silly Person concept myself, but it hasn't got much
use since I've been playing and I have a feeling that it's considered one of
those White Elephants by some Players.  So we'll go for it.  It also gives me
the opportunity to exercise the greater flexibility that the R-O-M rule gives
me in adding provisions to make the ruleset "more consistent".  So I will pick
R1651 as the selection this week and add the provision to repeal 1650 as well
(the Silly Person).

If you want to sponsor this, please refer to P3688 or the title "Repeal Rule
1651 (The Silly Proposal)".
