I can confirm this.  My apologies, but I missed seeing this message in the
collection that Blob sent me.  Normally I would not delay adding a submitted
proposal to the queue, but I do note that the Rule makes this an ASAP
requirement, so that I have not broken any Rules by this oversight, thanks to
Steve's inquiry.  Still, there is no excuse for such oversight.  To make up for
this, to some extent, I hereby exercise the Promotor's prerogative to raise the
priority of "Indelible Proposal Voting" to 3.

Proposal Chuck113
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II

I request that this Proposal have AI=5.

The Rule entitled "A Monument to the Threat" is hereby repealed.

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then a Rule, entitled "A Win for
Non-Threat" is hereby created, with the following text:

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" win the game upon creation
      of this Rule.  This takes precedence over Rules that would
      prevent any of them from winning the game at that time.

      Any Threat Trombones in existence are hereby destroyed.

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" are granted the Patent
      Title "Threat Trombone Mute".

      Chuck is granted the Patent Title "CounterScamster".

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: A Win for everyone might seem a little extreme, but
if everyone else doesn't get a reward at least that given
to certain people by the Veto Scam, why not just vote down
the Veto Scam?

I'd like to limit the win and PT to those voting FOR Part I,
but I'm afraid that would run afoul of R1003.]

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

[Comment: Close this loophole.]

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then the Rule whose text
begins, "No instrument can create, or empower another entity to create,"
has its Power set to 3, and is amended to read as follows; if
Proposal 3710 has not been adopted, then a Rule is created with Power=3
and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

[Comment: much shorter and more effective than Swann/Threat's
version.  Theirs has several problems.  First, does not
prevent an intrument from *changing* the Power of another.
Second, sets a Proposal's Power *before* it is adopted.
(Just look at what I did here with such a loophole!  Even
though TGOVSP seems to guard against that by not allowing
a Proposal to "take effect" until it's adopted, it's
still a dangerous precedent, IMO.)  R594 sets the Power of
a Proposal once it's adopted, anyway.  Also, their "Proposals
are explicitly exempt from this provision" is unclear--are
Proposals exempt as the creating entity, the created entity,
or both?  They have to throw in an extra prohibition on
Proposals later to make up for their ambiguity.  Finally, got
rid of the final paragraph, setting the default Power of
instruments to 1, as I'm not fond of having instruments
other than Proposals and Rules anyway, and I don't want to
encourage it.]
