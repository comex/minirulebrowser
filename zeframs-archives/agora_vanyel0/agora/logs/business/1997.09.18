Ok.  H. CotC take note.  I hereby make the following CFJ.

For proposals distributed during the infection of R693, the ten days
immediately following the distribution of each such proposal will be designated
its Voting Period immediately upon the disinfection of R693.

Arguments:  See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

I am just feeling a bit strange, so:

I hereby create a new Currency, with the following properties:

Name: Euclids
Mintor: Ørjan
Recordkeepor: Ørjan
MUQ: Pi

Anyone want a Euclid or 6.28? :-)

Greetings,
Ørjan (resisting the urge to involve Ackermann, Goodstein[sp] or the Busy
Beaver).

Well, I think Scott, Chuck and I all disagree with you there. We
seem to be of the opinion that this message is, implicitly, 3
Payment Orders for 1 Indulgence each.

The definition of 'cat' above is, of course, no good, but it's not
meant to be. In any case, the I agree that we cannot claim that
something which is not an order is a Payment Order. The claim is
that the above message *is*, implicitly, an order.

Well, I started this thread in order to determine whether I should
Appeal CFJ 940. I'm beginning to think I should.

In fact: I hereby call for the Appeal of the Judgement of CFJ 940.
This whole question needs to be looked at more closely, it seems.
