The truth or falsity of the claims may be a matter of opinion, in the
sense that *in general*, such claims are things about which rational
people might disagree. That does not mean that *specific* such claims
are immune to support or destruction by evidence, or that you can
honourably make them with impunity without producing evidence in support
of them. 

You accused me of hypocrisy for claiming on the one hand to want a
"meaningful economy", while on the other, opposing SA, which you claimed
would add a meaningful item to that economy. In response, I produced an
argument showing that the right to Object is economically worthless due
to oversupply. Neither you nor anyone else have replied to this
argument. (But even if this argument were to fail, that wouldn't show
that I was a hypocrite.) Your charge that I am motivated by a lust for
power is similarly unsupported, and contradicted by my past behaviour.

Your tactics appear to be to make and repeat these baseless
slurs against me, and then when challenged to produce evidence in
support of them, to demur and say "it's a matter of opinion, so I can
say anything I like". Do you imagine that you are making a positive
contribution to the game by pursuing such tactics? What do you find so
intoxicating about the stench of acrimony your use of such tactics
leaves hanging in the air?

H. Herald Crito,

I transfer a Kudo 

FROM General Chaos, for using ad hominem tactics which make the game
acrimonious and therefore less enjoyable, 

TO Vlad, who has, as he always does, managed to find much more
honourable ways to express his disagreement with me.

To whom it may concern (and most specifically the Clerk of the Courts):

I am no longer interested in participating in this game.  It has
ceased to be interesting for me, and I have better ways to consume my
time than to be insulted by Steve.

I hereby transfer all of my Currencies (that is, P-Notes, Voting
Tokens, and Indulgences) to Vlad.  May he find a decent use for them.

I believe the Reports I have just recently posted will be adequate for 
my successor in the Promotor's Office to continue without difficulty.

I withdraw my nomination for Justiciar.

Finally, I hereby call for a Rebellion.

Enjoy.
