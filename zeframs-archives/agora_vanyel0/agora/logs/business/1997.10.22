                               CFJ 1047

    "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial."

======================================================================

After reviewing all of the evidence, one point sticks out that simply
cannot be ignored.  Justice Andre argued that General Chaos claimed that
transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or VT1041,
both POs being for the amount of 2VTs each.  This statement misrepresents
the actual game state.  By denying the COE which alleged as such, General
Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a class 1 crime which
bears a penalty of 1 Blot.

I hereby find this CFJ to be TRUE.

Since this CFJ was reassigned, Michael's original Injunction had no effect.

I hereby issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalize General Chaos for this
Crime.

I think this Judgement is plain wrong. What General Chaos denied was
that Harlequin's Transfer Order(s) succeeded in satisfying certain
Payment Orders. As it happens, this was a completely correct
description of the situation, even though it was delivered for
completely the wrong reasons.  But G. Chaos' reasons for denying the
COE don't enter into it. On the crucial (indeed, only) issue of
substance, which TOs satisfied which POs, General Chaos was correct. 
Whether the same (or similarly worded) TOs issued in different
circumstances, viz, with Harlequin in possession of 4 VTs, would have
satisfied the POs is totally irrelevant.

I said this in my Appeal Judgement, and Justice elJefe agreed with
me.  As the duly appointed Justices assigned to hear the Appeal, that
ought to have been the end of the matter. But this annoying bug in
R1693 which I've now proposed to fix has caused the CFJ to be
re-assigned, and Vir has chosen to side with the minority decision of
Justice Andre. So here we are.

What to do? It seems tiresome to Appeal the Judgement, but what else
is there to do? I think there's a reasonably important principle at
stake here concerning what and isn't relevant when denying a COE, and
in Judging whether a particular denial was correct. I don't feel that
I can in good conscience allow the principle defended by Andre and
Vir to become precedent for future cases.

Therefore, I appeal Vir's Judgement in CFJ 1047. CotC Andre, please
do so note.

There's an interesting question as to who will be eligible to
serve as Justice, if, as I expect, a third insistence is heard
and an Appeal is initiated. In particular, will Andre, elJefe
and I be eligible? Concerning the eligibility of Justices, Rule 991
states:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

I take it that the Board to be constituted to hear the Appeal of
Vir's Judgement is not the same Board that heard the Appeal of
Michael's Judgement, so (i) does not apply. We can disregard (ii),
(iv) and (v) as irrelevant. The applicability of (iii) depends on
how seriously you take the Judge/Justice distinction. I'm inclined
to think that I haven't been a Judge of this CFJ, only a Justice, and
so (iii) does not disqualify me (or elJefe or Andre). Do we have
any precedent on this?

Assuming that Andre, elJefe and I are eligible to serve as Justices,
we might expect the same 2-1 decision as we have already had (unless
elJefe or Andre changes their mind; I won't be changing mine.) I would
suggest to CotC Andre that he delay as long as is legally permitted
before assigning Justices to the Board of Appeals. The Justices can
then delay their decisions long enough for the amendment to R1693 to
pass, so that another 2-1 decision does not result in yet another
re-assignment of the CFJ.

Before anyone else does:
I hereby COE on the assignment of CFJ 1060. Kolja A. is not, as claimed
in the message, On Hold. The Assignment does not change (the random
number between 1 and 15, 15 Kolja A., others General Chaos came out on
10).

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1060

"Ross Morgan-Linial did not successfully transfer a Kudo from 
 Harlequin to Blob on October 14."

======================================================================

Judge:       General Chaos

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
	     General Chaos, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, 
	     Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Harlequin
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Harlequin, 17 Oct 1997 21:55:17 -0400 (EDT)
   (might have been later)
  Assigned to General Chaos, 22 Oct 1997 21:52:17 +0200 (MET DST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Arguments: R1478 says that "The Executor of an entity is a Player who 
is empowered by the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e 
was that entity. Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player 
is eir own Executor." I argue that this should properly be read
to define any Player who can act on behalf of an entity as that
entity's Executor. Since, on October 14, Antimatter was not his
own executor, he could not act on his own behalf and thus his attempt
to transfer a Kudo failed.

Relevant Rules: R1478.
