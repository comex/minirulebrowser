Proto:  Repair Probate

Amend Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsibilities) by replacing "executor in
probate" with "trustee".

Amend Rule 1601 (Probate) by replacing this text:

      An entity which would otherwise be destroyed but the destruction of
      which is being deferred due to the foregoing provisions is called
      'terminal'.

this text:

      An entity is terminal if and only if it is a deregistered Player
      in Probate, or an entity that would be destroyed in the absence of
      the foregoing provisions.

Rename Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) to "Trustees".

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing "thia" with "this".

Amend Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) by replacing this text:

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

with this text:

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces to the Public Forum the completion of the implementation
      of a Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate; or, if the
      entity has no Trustee, when the Notary announces to the Public
      Forum that that entity is no longer in Probate.

Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.4)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless another Rule states
      otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
      initially owned by the Bank, unless otherwise specified.  No entity other
      than the Bank may own more than five Structures.

      A Structure is created or destroyed whenever a Player reports its
      creation or destruction as required by the Rules.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 50 Ergs to that
      Player.  In addition, the Registrar shall report to the Cartographor that
      3 Structures are created in that Player's possession.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, 50 Ergs, and 3 Structures are
            created in that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price and Maintenance Fee to the
      Bank.

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
      shall pay out half the old Type's price (rounded down) to the Structure's
      owner.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      Only Types of Structure defined by the Rules exist.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle       none       none           none
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      A Church's Production depends on its color.  A green Church Produces 1
      Indulgence and becomes red; a red Church produces 0 Indulgences and
      becomes green.

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it
      is Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

I vote twice AGAINST Proposal 3710.  Mostly, just in case Antimatter's
recent CFJ is judged TRUE.

Note that even under that assumption, another two Votes AGAINST are still
needed.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
