H. Promotor,

I hereby transfer 1 P-Note to Michael.

Michael, 1 VT will be sufficient payment, thank you.

Not me!  I have used up my last P-Note in getting a Proposal onto the
Queue.  If it doesn't get distributed within a month, its Priority
will drop to zero, and then it will likely be culled by the Promotor.
My investment will have had zero return, and won't even had had a
chance to produce any return.  

I could do with an extra P-Note to push its priority even higher, but
that would in a sense be self-defeating because I would have then
spent two P-Notes in order to (possibly) get two back.

Still, better to remain in the same financial position, and have my
proposal adopted than to lose a P-Note and not ever have the Proposal
see the light of day.

Would one of those P-Note rich Players care to sell me a P-Note?  I
can perhaps offer 1 or 2 VTs.  (I will need some in reserve to pay for
a vote on the proposal itself.)

This "game within a game" of proposal sponsorship is certainly a
difficult one for the poverty-stricken.  As they say, it takes money
to make money.  

Michael

Dear me. I was just doing a bit of political grandstanding. I didn't
mean to offend.  I don't want you to go. Not in the least! I want you
to stay and fight! I was just beginning to have fun - I thought I had
found a worthy opponent. I'm so sorry if you took my remarks as 
personally offensive. Please don't leave like this Andre. I'm sorry.

I actually don't want you to have to give up the Chancellorship. You
were doing a good job. I thought the Speaker's reaction was overdoing
it a bit. Actually, I have been rather worried that we couldn't replace
you if we wanted to - a number of closet democrats seem to be coming
out all of a sudden. I thought I might have a losing battle on my
hands. 

I apologise for taking too aggressive an approach to the game. But be
assured, it is just a game to me, and I never wanted to hurt anyone by
my actions. Please forgive me. And say you'll stay.

Malcolm
