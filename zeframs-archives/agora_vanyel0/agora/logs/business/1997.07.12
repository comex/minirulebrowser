I Vote as follows:

3534 FOR x 2
3535 FOR x 2
3536 FOR
3537 FOR
3538 FOR
3539 AGAINST

On 3539, "a list of all Neutral and Openly Hostile Nomics" should IMO be "a
list of all non-Neutral Nomics", and "if it [a Member Nomic of Internomic]
is Hostile" should be "if it is Openly Hostile".

I hereby Disown Proposal 3539 (paying 1 P-Note to do so). I will propose
a corrected version soon. By the way, the first should be corrected to
"a list of all Friendly and Openly Hostile Nomics", IMO.
