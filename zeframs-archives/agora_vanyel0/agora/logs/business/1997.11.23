I agree with this reasoning.  However:

1) Swann's leaving Probate did not remove Steve as eir EiP.
2) Swann's EiP is still required to carry out the Probate Code, regardless
   of whether Swann is in Probate.
3) I (as Notary) am permitted to assign someone an EiP even when not
   required by the Rules to do so, therefore my assignment of General Chaos
   as Swann's new EiP is effective.

See Rule 1738, as well as the failure of the Ruleset to include certain
clauses.

Also:

4) If an entity leaves Probate due to improper announcement of the completion
   of Probate, then that entity will immediately re-enter Probate, at least
   if the entity possesses Currency and has not re-registered.  (I'm not sure
   what happens if either or both of those conditions is false.)

Future Notary's Reports will reflect these beliefs.

Because your EiP is Elde.

However, upon careful reading of Rule 1738 and a quick search for "Probate"
in the rest of the Ruleset, it appears that I can assign an EiP whenever I
want to.  (No Rule ever says "The Notary may not assign an EiP if..." or
"The Notary may assign an EiP only if..."; it only says "The Notary shall
assign an EiP if...".)  In particular, I can assign an EiP to an entity even
if it already has an EiP.

I hereby assign Blob as Executor in Probate of Blob.

Blob, you must now follow the Probate Code with regard to yourself.

       General Chaos protoes "Pragmatization of Transfer Orders":  A Currency
         Recordkeepor's determination of the success or failure of a Transfer

         appoints a successor, the successor assumes Office only if e consents.

       Michael Proposes "Resignation of Offices cleared up":  Same general
         effect as Steve's "Resignation and consent"; shorter, but the
         successor must give consent prior to being appointed.

       elJefe Proposes "No nonplayer responsibilities":  Non-Players are
         barred from any role or position to which a Rule assigns duties or
         powers.

11/22  General Chaos protoes "Probate, Take Two", a Probate reform.

11/23  General Chaos re-protoes "Probate, Take Two".

       General Chaos protoes "Persistent Judges":  Judges are not removed from
         a CFJ due to delinquency till two Players demand it in the PF.  (Other
         penalties for delinquent Judgement still apply.)

       General Chaos protoes "Simplify Judicial Salaries", requiring them to be
         reported within a week (ASAP imposes an ordering requirement).
