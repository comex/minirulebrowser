The Player in the Jurisdiction has unanimously consented that its Regulations
are changed to:

1. Andre is this Contest's Contestmaster. No Player may become a 
   Contestant. There is no Contest Fee.
2. The Contestmaster may spend the Contest's Currency as he wishes.
3. Andre is the Frankenstein Monster of these Regulations.
4. The Contest dissolves when the Contestmaster so decides. However, no
   such dissolution may take place if the Contest Fund contains any
   Currencies.

I'm sorry I have to do this, but RL time constraints are getting
