PROTO-Proposal: Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies :)
 
Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Change Rule 1712's title ("Distribution of Indulgences") to
"Indulgences are a Closed System" and amend it to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players. For each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      transfer the Indulgence to em. 

      Whenever a Player transfers an Indulgence to the Bank in order 
      to satisfy a Blot, or a Blot is vacated, one Indulgence in the 
      Bank is destroyed. Whenever a Blot is issued, one Indulgence
      is created in the Bank.

      If the number of Indulgences in existence is ever less than the 
      number of Blots minus one, the Bank is required to create enough
      Indulgences so that the number of Indulgences is equal to the 
      number of Blots minus one.

      If the number of Indulgences in existence is ever more than the 
      number of Blots minus one, the Bank is required to destroy 
      enough Indulgences so that the number of Indulgences is equal to

      the number of Blots minus one. If the Bank does not possess 
      sufficient Indulgences, the Bank is required to destroy all 
      Indulgences it possesses.
      
Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birth."

{Comments:
Changed the Indulgence distribution method and fiddled with it until
it's got a reasonable facsimile of a closed system. Simplified stuff,
too, and used Ratification rather than hard-coding to set Players'
values correctly.
}

It is improper and illegal for you to record this transfer.  Only the
Chancellor, acting as the Bank's Executor, may transfer Currencies
from the Bank to another entity.  Rule 1712 requires you to issue a
Payment Order for one Indulgence from the Bank to Vanyel, but does not
in any way authorize you to execute any Transfer Orders on behalf of
the Bank.

I therefore claim that this Herald's Report is in error, in that it
reflects a transfer of Currencies which was not the result of a
legally submitted Transfer Order.

PROTO:Revise Nomic Entities


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let the following Rule be created:

     The name of any entity, if that name is assigned by the Rules, or 
     via procedures defined in the Rules, is a Nomic Property.  The 
     Rules may not assign two entities the same name.  If an attempt is 
     made to give entities duplicate names, only one entity is so named, 
     the other is unnamed.  The named entity is determined as follows:

      i) If both entities are named directly by the Rules, the entity 
         named by the higher precedence Rule is named.

     ii) If one entity is named directly by a Rule and the other is 
         named by some other procedure, the entity named by the Rule is 
         named.

    iii) If both entities are named by procedures other than directly 
         by a Rule, then the entity named first is the named entity.

     Classes of entities are themselves entities for the purpose of 
     this rule, and are permitted to have names.  A Players nickname is 
     a name for the purpose of this rule.  

{Comment: This finally legislates a proceedure to deal with duplicate
          names, I also think it would be better to get away from the
          idea of "Name" since IMO this restriction was origginally 
          intended to _avoid_ confusion.  I think that if the Rules call
          an entity something, that should be its name unless something
          says different.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1586 is amended to read as follows:

      Any entity that has existence solely due to the fact that the
      Rules define it to exist, shall cease to exist whenever those
      Rules are repealed or amended to remove the definition of that 
      entity.

      When the Rules defining a given entity are amended such that they
      still define the entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

{Comment: Axed the Nomic Entity idea, but kept the continuity provisions,
          which were the important part of this rule anyway.}

------------------------

I hereby admit this claim.  This report, and my suggestion for Indulgence/Blot
balancing were based on a deeply flawed understanding of Pragmatic Currencies. 
I see now the error of my ways - only the Chancellor is allowed to transfer,
create, or destroy currencies in the Bank.  The Rules do not give this power,
even in limited circumstances, to any other Officer.  I submit my most abject
apologies for my unbounded stupidity.  I submit a corrected version of the
Herald's report below.  8)

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Interesting question.  I'm not sure whether this should be treated as
a null action, or if it should be interpreted as a transfer of 1
P-Note to the Bank.  (It's clearly legal for you to do so, but it may
not have the effect of satisfying the Payment Order I just executed.)

Opinions?

I think it's clear that this was a conditional attempt to make a transfer in
order to satisfy a future PO, but I won't lose any sleep if I lose an extra
P-Note.  8)

In any case, if the above Payment Order has not already been satisfied, I
hereby transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank in order to satisfy this PO.

The above was posted on July 8, meaning that Elde has been Absent
since July 22. In accordance with R1042, I hereby cause Elde to
become Abandoning, which results in his deregistration, which I
hereby report in my capacity as Registrar.
