This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Simpler Changing of the Voting
Tariff" and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1682 be amended to read:

The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for VTs,
between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting Tariff to
any value in this range at any time by announcing the change in the
Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours after it is announced. 
Until the Promotor sets another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.
