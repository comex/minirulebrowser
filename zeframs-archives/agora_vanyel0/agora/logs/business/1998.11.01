As a result of the Board's decision to overturn Morendil's Judgement,
Morendil forfeits his Judicial Salary. I therefore vacate Payment Order
CVT0002.

According to R1734, the result of this is that the Recordkeepor for VTs,
Accountor lee, is required to issue a reversing order from Morendil to
the Bank for 1 VT.

A question about this: why the necessity to vacate the PO once it is
satisfied? Why not just issue the reversing order?
