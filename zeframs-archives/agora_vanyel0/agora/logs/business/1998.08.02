I want everyone to know that i did my best to look at the rules and
judge the statement accordingly.    I take offense at the suggestion
that I did not give this CFJ sufficient consideration.  I attempted to
state my reasoning concisely. I pared down my first draft so that my
reasoning would be clear to all.  Apparently in Agora, brevity is
viewed as a sign of lack of thought.  I shall therefore not be brief. 

I can understand that this ruling is sufficiently important to warrant
another look, but to suggest that I did not consider game custom as i
should have or given this much thought is insulting.  I looked long and
hard at the rules.  I read both current and old Rulesets, and I looked
at how language was used. I consulted with experts on Agora as to the
meaning of certain phrases.

In particular, i looked at the way the word directly is used in Rule
1808/0. In other many places in the Rules, there are specifications
about Nomic Entity being submitted to another Nomic Entity, such as a
Player or an Officer.  Only in this Rule does it specify that something
a Nomic Entity is to be submitted directly. The phrase is unique. 
However i did not find it ambiguous.

I reasoned that if posting a statement to the Public Forum saying it
was an Order to a Player were sufficient to execute an order, then the
language of Rule 1080/0 would be more like the language that specifies
how Appeals are submitted to the CotC, or more like the language in
many other Rules. In addition, if there were no other more direct way
to contact a Player, then the language in Rule 1080/0 would be
ambiguous. 

In an Official report, the Registrar’s Report, the email address of
each Player is given.  Thus, in an official document, a way to directly
contact a Player, other than a message to their attention in the Public
Forum, is given.

To me it was unambiguous that according to Rule 1080/0 that Private
orders had to be submitted not simply to the Public Forum, but rather
to that Player in a more direct fashion.  Since the Rule seemed clear
to me, i could not even consider game custom. I knew my ruling would be
inconvenient, but i felt compelled by the Rules to judge the way that I
did.  I gave this more consideration than some Players would have, and
for that I have been insulted in the Public forum.

As Payment Order VT2567 had been fulfilled before it was vacater, I
hereby issue the following reversal PO:

I order Blob to pay 0.8 VTs to the Bank.

And, while I'm at it, I'll pay the order, and other debts:

I hereby transfer 0.8 VTs to the Bank to satisfy the above PO.
I hereby transfer 3.0 VTs to the Bank to satisfy VT2589.

I'm also looking for volunteers to take on the Accountorship. 
I have discovered that it is too much work for me. I would also be
happy to support a proposal giving the Accountor a pay increase.

Oops, typo.  I transfer 1 VT to the Bank to satisfy VT2600, if it has not
already been satisfied.  Now is there a way to get those 2 VTs back?

lee, don't take the strong reaction to your Judgement personally. Such
reactions are an inevitable sequel to the delivery of a Judgement with
profound and disturbing consequences.

I don't know whether your Judgement will be upheld on Appeal or not. I
think you've made a good defense of your Judgement, and I will be
considering your arguments carefully as member of the Board of Appeals.
I do wish to state publically however that I was impressed with your
conduct as a Judge, and would not hesitate to recommend your example to
other new Players looking for a model to emulate.

H. Herald Crito,

I hereby transfer a Kudo

TO lee, in recognition and appreciation of the seriousness with which he
took his responsibility to Judge the difficult CFJ 1100,

FROM Michael, whose tardiness in distributing the CFJ made the Judgement
of it more difficult than it need have been.

Since Murphy has just been Elected Speaker-Elect, and I want to avoid
any future complications with the Speaker and the Justiciar being the
same person, I hereby announce that Morendil has won the Election for
Justiciar.

Speaker Steve

PS. An announcement on the Wizard Election is pending.
