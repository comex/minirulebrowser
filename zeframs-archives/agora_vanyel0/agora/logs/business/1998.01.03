Swann's Estate is not terminal; hence, I am restricted to considering
the creditors of the estate.

Indulgences: Debits are POI627, POI633, POI647, and POI651, totaling 4
Indulgences.  All will be vacated, and 4 Indulgences will be
transferred from the Estate to the Bank.

P-Notes: Debits are POP095, POP097, and POP137, totaling 3 P-Notes.
All will be vacated, as will be POP160, a credit of 3 P-Notes.

VTs: There are no debits.

Other Currencies: There are no debits.

Vlad's estate is terminal; there is no Will.

The estate's assets are insufficient to meet all of its debts: there
are insufficient P-Notes, but an excess of VTs.  Since the only
creditor of the estate is the Bank, however, no purpose is served by
attempting to allocate VTs in lieu of P-Notes in this case.

Indulgences: Debits are POI274 and POI582, totaling 4 Indulgences.
All will be vacated, and 4 Indulgences will be transferred to the
Bank.

P-Notes: Debits are POP056, POP057, POP058, totaling 3 P-Notes.  All
will be vacated, and 2 P-Notes will be transferred to the Bank.

VTs: Sole debit is VT1480, totaling 0.5 VT.  It will be vacated.  The
sole credit, VT1711, totaling 8 VTs, will also be vacated.  1 VT will
be transferred to the Bank.

Other Currencies: No debits, credits, or holdings.

Seeing no Silliness going on, I hereby designate myself the Silly Person
for this week. 

I then hereby submit this here Silly Proposal:

Proposal: Guatemalan Insanity Peppers

####
Rule 1729 ("Insanity") shall be amended,
to read the following way, it is intended:

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.

      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      (Public votes shall not be counted, nor shall they be legal,
      Only votes in private shall be considered right and regal.)

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

      This shall all be true, for Players naughty and 
         upstanding,
      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
####
