I hereby issue a Transfer Order for 3.5 VTs from myself to the Threat.

That having been executed, I now proceed to perform my duties as my EiP:

1) I posess no units of any currency, and have no creditors, so sections
3 and 4 of the Probate code are trivially fulfilled.

2a) I have a debt of 2.0 VTs to the Bank as reported by the Assessor:

Preface:

     This is a revamp of an old, old, old proto that I never proposed.  
     It was based on the idea of the old currency, Win Tokens-- which I 
     saw as an admirable attempt to create a Kudolike entity that had an 
     effect on the game, having value in and of itself.  I thought the 
     implementation of Tokens fell short of their goal because of the 
     fact that they were hardwired into a Win.  That meant that the 
     Token dynamic became long periods of Quiescence followed by brief 
     spurts of activity.  The hardwired-Win aspect of Tokens also tended 
     to devalue them as Currency, limiting transfers to those 
     immediately prior to a Win.  Lastly, they were hampered because of 
     people doing their best to _prevent_ any Win by Tokens.  So, Tokens 
     never worked quite as envisioned.

     This proto was intended to offer here a property that offers a 
     dynamic that operates more as Tokens had been intended to behave.  
     ie. This was written with the idea to encourage currency 
     manipulation, conspiracy, and political wrangling.

     I have rewritten the Proto to take into account the changes since I 
     first wrote it (Currency Reform, the abolition of Points, the Mad 
     Scientist and Locations.)

PROTO: Magnetism

Let the following Rule be created
(Title: Magnetism):

     There exists a property called Magnetism.  Magnetism is a property 
     possessed solely by Players, and its value is always integral. A 
     Player's Magnetism can be positive (an Attractive Player), negative 
     (a Repulsive Player), or zero (a Neutral Player).

     A Player's Magnetism can only change as described in the Rules 
     applying specifically to Magnetism.

     Any new Player, or any Player who has no recorded Magnetisim,
     begins as Neutral.

{Comment: Basic definitional Rule, setting up most of the terminology,
          making sure Magnetism is integral.}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: The Mad Scientist Records Magnetism):

     The Mad Scientist shall keep a record of each Player's Magnetism, 
     and the changes made to that Player's Magnetism.  At least once 
     each week the Mad Scientist shall publish an Official Report that 
     includes, but is not limited to, the following:

       i) The current Flux & Magnetism of each Player.
      ii) The nature and magnitude of all Magnetism changes made since 
          the last report of Player's Magnetism.
     iii) All required Magnetisim-mandated Payment Orders for the
          preceeding week.
      iv) All Players who's Location is the Faraday Cage.

{Comment: This Rule is solely bookkeeping.  The good part's next.}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: Flux and Magnetism changes):

     Every Player has a characteristic Flux, which is also the number of 
     Magnetism Changes that Player can cause in a single Nomic Week.  
     Each Player's Flux is equal to one plus the integral portion of 
     half the absolute magnitude of that Player's Magnetism.

     When a Player undergoes a Magnetism Change, eir current Flux is 
     either added to, or subtracted from, eir current Magnetism. Any 
     Player can cause a Magnetism Change in any other Player, but e may 
     not cause eimself to undergo a Magnetism Change.

     A Magnetism Change occurs when a Player sends a Magnetism Change 
     Request to the Mad Scientist that fits the following criteria:

       i) The Requesting Player has not yet, during the current Nomic 
          Week, made a Magnetism Change to the Player to undergo the 
          Requested Magnetism Change. No Player may cause a Magnetism
          Change in another Player more than once in a Nomic Week.

      ii) The Requesting Player has not yet, during the current Nomic 
          Week, made a number of Magnetism Changes that equals or 
          exceeds eir current Flux. Flux changes do not affect Magnetism 
          Changes made prior to the change in Flux.

     iii) Neither the requesting Player, or the Player to undergo the 
          requested Magnetism Change, is located in the Faraday Cage
          or the Stasis Chamber.

      iv) The Request indicates whether the Magnetism Change shall be
          positive or negative.

     If these criteria are not met, the requested Magnetism Change does 
     not occur and does not count against the number of Magnetism 
     Changes the requesting Player may initiate in a single Week.

{Comment: This is where it gets interesting (and a bit of a pain :)
          Flux, like the name implies, varies. Which means that everyone
          has a variable number of transfers of a variable amount.  The
          progression will no longer be linear. (Starting at zero, five
          positive changes result in M:0 F:1, M:1 F:1, M:2 F:2, M:4 F:3
          M:7 F:4, M:11 F:6.)  Obviously, this is why the restriction of
          (i)}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: The Faraday Cage):

     There exists a Location known as the Faraday Cage.

     Only Attractive or Repulsive Players may remain located in the 
     Faraday Cage.  If a Player in the Faraday Cage becomes Neutral, eir 
     Location is immediately changed to the Origin.

     All movement to or from the Faraday Cage must be announced in the 
     Public Forum.

     In order to move from the Faraday Cage, a Player in the Faraday 
     Cage must inform the Cartographer at least seven days in advance of 
     the move.  If no date is specified on the move, the Player shall 
     move exactly seven days from the date of the message.

     Immediately after the end of each calendar quarter, all Players are 
     immediately released from the Faraday Cage.

     While inside the Faraday Cage, a Player cannot undergo a Magnetism 
     Change initiated by another Player, nor can e initiate any 
     Magnetism Changes eimself.  This takes precedence over Rules that 
     would allow a Player inside the Faraday Cage to do either.

     At the end of each full Nomic Week an Attractive Player remains
     located in the Faraday Cage, eir Magnitisim is reduced by one.

     At the end of each full Nomic Week a Repulsive Player remains
     located in the Faraday Cage, eir Magnitisim is increased by one.

{Comment: There are various reasons why someone would wish to be
          Immunized from the effects of Magnetism, its volatility being
          a major reason. This will also allow severely Repulsed Players 
          to insure that eventually they'll return to neutral (though 
          there are a few benefits to being Repulsive.)}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: Attractive Players):

     As soon as possible upon the start of every Nomic Week, the Mad
     Scientist shall pay out the following Currencies to each Attractive 
     Player:

       i) VTs equal to one half eir current Magnetism.
      ii) P-Notes equal to the integral portion of one quarter eir
          current Magnetism.
     iii) Indulgences equal to the integral portion of one quarter eir
          current Flux.

{Comment: Here is where I correct what I think of as the "Win Token
          mistake."  Magnetism is tied to something positive, but not 
          directly to winning.  I'd appreciate comments on the magnitude 
          of this income, though I don't know if we can say what's too 
          little or too much before the dynamics of magnetism play 
          themselves out.  (As this stands, someone with a Magnetism of 
          4 would gain 2 VT, 1 P-note, and no Indulgences, someone with
          a Magnetism of 11 would gain 5.5 VTs, 2 P-Notes, and 1
          Indulgence.)}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: Repulsive Players):

     As soon as possible upon the start of every Nomic Week, the Mad
     Scientist shall bill every Repulsive Player for the following
     Currencies:

       i) VTs equal to one half eir current Magnetism.
      ii) P-Notes equal to the integral portion of one quarter eir
          current Magnetism.
     iii) Indulgences equal to the integral portion of one quarter eir
          current Flux.


{Comment: The flipside of the prior Rule, all my comments about
          magnitude pertain here.}


Let the following Rule be created
(Title: Magnetic Wins)

     Immediatly after the absolute value of any Player's Magnetism
     equals or exceeds 35, that Player shall Win the Game.  If that 
     Player is prevented from winning, then the Player with the highest 
     absolute value of Magnetism and no win-preventing conditions shall 
     Win.  If there is a tie for the Win then all tied players Win.  
     Immediately afterwards, all Players who are not located in the
     Faraday Cage have their Magnetism halved, fractions rounded down 
     for Attractive Players, and up for Repulsive Players. Then all 
     Players in the Faraday Cage have their Location change to the 
     Origin. The Mad Scientist must record and report these changes as 
     soon as possible after such a Win occurs.

There is a new proposal, submitted by me on request from Berry Renken
(who recently sent mail searching for nomic life on other
planets). This has officially been distributed; voting in the Agora
referendum on this will last until Tue, 02 Dec 1997 23:19:29 -0500. 

I hope Berry will soon post some more info about this nomic. 

Here goes:

Hyrie, hyrie!  It is apparently a good IDEA to have a CONTEST and be the
FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER.

An Application to Create an Organization, HEREBYME is Created, Signed,
and Executed, NAMELY the following:

An Organization is created of class Contest, named "Å" and with THE
REGULATIONS:

	1.  Å's Contestmaster and Frankenstein Monster, who can change
	the Regulations at his whim, is Ørjan.
	2.  Den første som korrekt oversetter hva denne setningen sier får 
	et stemmemerke av konkurranselederen.
	3.  There will be no Contestants, as they would just mess up
	the place.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
