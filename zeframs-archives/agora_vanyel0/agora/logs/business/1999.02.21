**START PROPOSAL
| Be it resolved, that Rule 1815 be amended to read:

      (a) No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such
          by the Rules.

      (b) If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an Infraction,
          but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then there is
          no penalty for that act.

      (c) If the Rules define an act to be an Infraction, but fail to
          authorize any Player or Players to report instances of that
          Infraction, then that Infraction cannot be reported.
