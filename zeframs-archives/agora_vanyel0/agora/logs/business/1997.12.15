I hereby propose the following Proposal:

Proposal
Organizational Payment Orders

Create a Rule "Organizational Payment Orders" which reads:

     The Executor of Organization's SLC is empowered to execute Payment Orders
     from the Organization or from any Player within its Jurisdiction, but only
     such Payment Orders as are authorized by the SLC.

{ Comment:  The ability of Contests and Groups (old Rule 1534) to make
currency transfers from their contestants/members disappeared with
Pragmatic Currencies. Instead we merely have the SLC's power to require
Players to transfer currencies, which anyone can avoid by simply resigning
from the Contest or Group.  This proto restores the ability to make the
transfers happen regardless. }

H. Promotor Crito:

I hereby propose the following Proposal

Proposal
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days after
      e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT and
      the Judgement or dismissal is legal even though delivered late.
      Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes ineligible to
      Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven days
      after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes ineligible
      to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal submitted after
      this time is not legal and shall not be accepted by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be eligible
      before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither required
      nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or dismiss, that CFJ,
      and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that CFJ at the moment e
      becomes ineligible.


Amend Rule 591 by deleting the sentence:

      A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1565 by deleting the text ", and only when issued by the Judge
within the permitted deliberation period"

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1447 by changing the last sentence to read

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their determinations.


{ Comments:
1.) The CotC must accept late judgements, provided they reach the CotC
before e reports the Judge for failure to judge.

2.) Late Judgements are penalized (1 VT plus loss of Judicial salary).
However, Judges should not rest easy because the CotC may reassign a late
CFJ without warning, and then the penalty is 3 blots.

3.) The CotC has discretion on when to guillotine the lateness period, but
at most one week.

4.) Omit the troublesome phrase "prior to the end of the permitted time",
from Rule 408. }

-- elJefe

Judge's Verdict for CFJ 1073:

Judge's reasoning and Arguments:

The central question of the Statement, once it is given that there were 
unequivocally posts to the PF that alleged themselves to be player's 
votes on the given proposals, is whether or not the infection of Rule 
1598 prevented those votes from being, in the terms of Rule 206, Rule 
683, Rule 1741 and others, "cast."

Looking at what the infection of Rule 1598 did to the Ruleset, it left 
the Rules without an explicit definition of what a Transfer Order was, 
and more importantly it left us without a definition of what it was to 
submit or execute a Transfer Order.  While it might have been legal for 
Recordkeepors to continue paying attention to attempted TOs without 
these definitions, the fact is they did not do so, and that decision was 
at least as legal as the alternative.  So it is a fact that no TOs were 
successfully made or executed during the period of Rule 1598.

So the question is, can a Vote be cast without a successful Transfer 
Order?  Can Votes be cast when TOs are prevented by the Rules?

Rule 1442 [Power 1] states;

     "The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of 
      VTs, as specified below. . ."

The term "spending" is a unique term, that I find only in this Rule, and 
nowhere else in all the technical jargon of our Currency Rules.  If the 
word was not used as it is, I would argue for the common-sense 
definition of the term re Currencies, but the Rule does not allow this, 
since it specifies, "as specified below."  The Rule defines its own 
meaning for "spending a VT."

Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal."

>From the way this is worded, the only adequate definition for "spending 
a VT" we can glean from this rule is the "implicit submission of a 
delayed Transfer Order [...] for however many VTs."   If a player can 
only cast a Vote by spending VTs, the above paragraph states how those 
votes are cast (a message to the Assessor) and how the VTs are spent (an 
implied delayed Transfer Order.)

This is further strengthened by the wording later on where;

Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal."

The fact that when a vote is "uncast", the TO goes away implies that the
 implied TO is the "spending" and _not_ the implied TO's execution.  
This is important, since during the infection of 1598 we had no 
mechanism for successfully executing TOs, that didn't mean that Votes 
did not continue to create implied TOs.  What the infection did was make 
"implied TO" a noun without context or effect, but not without 
existence.  (Essentially rendering the 1442 the same as if all instances 
of delayed Transfer Orders with the word Blorg.  We don't know what a 
Blorg is, or what it does, but 1442 more or less equates creating a 
Blorg with spending a VT, which is its requirement for casting a vote.)

----

Side Note: Rule 1730 is a strange bird which gives a stopgap
interpretation for Delayed Transfer Order.  It still fails to give a 
procedure for executing a TO, so it doesn't really affect the above 
interpretation.  But the first paragraph of 1730 is very strange;

1730 [Power 1]

     "If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

It seems that it's lucky that Recordkeepors could still reject orders
during the infection, otherwise they might have found themselves under 
all sorts of uncomfortable obligations.  (Since IMO the capitalization 
of the word Order doesn't deprive it of its natural meaning in absence 
of a rule to the contrary.)

---

Back to Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal."

Setting aside the timing issue (if the Assessor delays the execution of 
TOs until a few hours after the end of the VP, the Rule implies they did 
not count) this is the crux of 1442 impact on the given Statement.  This 
is again because of the fact we have no executed TOs for the Proposals 
in question.  However, the problem is twofold;

  i) Can 1442 prevent Votes from being "counted"?
     (in the terms of Rule 955)
 ii) Would this prevent those Votes from being cast?

Last question first.  Rule 1442 already defines what it is to "cast" a 
vote, and it does not contradict that in the final paragraph.  According 
to 1442, a Vote is cast by sending a message to the Assessor and can 
only be "un-cast" by a cancellation of the Vote.  Whatever other rules 
say about "casting Votes" or even "casting VTs" the answer of whether 
1442 prevents casting Votes is fairly clear, it does not.

Now to the final question--
Does 1442 prevent Votes from being counted?

>From Rule 955 [Power 3]

     "When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor."

This trumps whatever 1442 would say to the contrary.  There has been 
some argument that the final restriction of 1442 implies that such Votes 
(without successfully executed TOs) are not "legally cast,"  but I think 
it is a stretch to avoid this conflict in that manner.  1442 implies 
nothing in its text about the legality of the casting of any Vote.  It 
merely defines what casting a Vote is, and makes an attempt at a 
restriction based on the results of that Vote (the implied TO).  It is 
transparent in the wording that Votes are cast at the time they are 
sent, and it is a strain to interpret the last paragraph of 1442 as 
retroactively illegalizing the casting of votes when it says nothing
about the casting of those Votes, but only about TOs and counting Votes.

It is this Judge's opinion that 1442 states that Votes are [legally] 
cast when the Voting Entity sends a message to the Assessor.  It is also 
the Judge's opinion that, due to the precedence of Rule 955, these Votes 
are to be counted by the Assessor regardless of the success or failure 
of any related Transfer Orders.  I hereby Judge the Statement True.
=========================
Evidence:



Rule 955/3 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.  The
      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

Rule 1442/11 (Power=1)
Using VTs

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

Rule 1730/0 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

I herby transfer a kudo from General Chaos to Oerjan, because
repealing the FM Rule just because it has a temporary effect on
Voting patterns is roughly akin to repealing the Virus because it
made our lives difficult by infecting the TO Rule.  Both are rather
narrow objections, and axing the rule just because of them is an
exercise in overkill.  The General's objections would've been
easily dealt with, and more interestingly, by an amendment to the 
FM, say the following;

"Any Frankenstein Monsters are blue, and while any FM's are blue, this
Rule cannot have effect on who is a Voting Entity and the Mad Scientist 
cannot seclect this sentence for deletion."

I also applaud both Oerjan's attempt to address the concerns of some
players, and being an all-in-all worthwhile Mad Scientist.

If that was the only problem I would not have resigned the
Assessorship in protest.  The problem is that the FM both creates a
considerable degree of uncertainty on its own (by constantly
disrupting the Rules) and, worse, compounds the uncertainity that is
everpresent from routine play.  It's not just one particular Rule
Change that was problematic; it's an endemic problem that I have with
_all_ random and automatic Rule Changes.  (I also intend to support
the Proposal to repeal the Virus--assuming it is even possible to vote
on that Proposal; I can't tell.  If there had not been such a Proposal
extant, I would have made one myself.)

Furthermore, neither the Virus nor the Frankenstein Mutator slow down
for a Crisis.  They just keep right on firing away at the Ruleset,
making it ever harder to right the Game when it founders.  And as
Assessor I have been taking a great deal of the incoming fire, simply
by virtue of holding the Game's most complex Office.  This Game _does
not function_ without the Assessor.  Making the Office of Assessor
impossible or overly burdensome for any Player to perform is suicidal.

I expected to lose a Kudo over this affair, but over my precipitous
resignation of the Assessorship, not over my proper targeting of the
FM as a severe source of instability and dysfunction in Agora's
Rules.  

Oh, by the way: I hereby transfer one Kudo from Swann for not
appreciating the importance of Officers, and especially the Assessor,
to Michael, as compensation for dumping the Assessorship into his lap
unexpectedly.

I hereby submit the following three proposals, paying the
Petitition fee for the first two.
---
PROPOSAL: Quorum Tools

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Buyback}

     Any Player other than the Assessor is permitted to buyback Quorum 
     on a particular Proposal.  A Player is only permitted to do this
     once for any single Proposal. A Player does this by informing the 
     Assessor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a specified Proposal. 
     That Player can rescind eir buyback before the end of the voting 
     period by sending a message stating so to the Assessor.

     The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not rescinded) 
     is to reduce the Quorum on the specified Proposal by one.  If
     multiple Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal, the effect is 
     cumulative.

     At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor 
     shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for 
     each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Assessor shall then bill 
     each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

     The Assessor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a 
     Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

---------------
PROPOSAL: Quorum Tools II

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Without Objection}

     The Speaker has the power to, Without Objection, designate any 
     Proposal whose voting period is underway to have achieved Quorum.
     That Proposal shall then have its Quorum adjusted to equal zero.

     This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
     Proposals.

---------------
PROPOSAL: Stylishness

Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Stylishness of Rules}

     Every Rule has associated with it a value known as that Rule's 
     Stylishness.  A Rule's Stylishness shall be an integral value that 
     is positive, negative, or zero.  A Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     positive is a Stylish Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is 
     negative is a Dull Rule, a Rule with a Stylishness that is zero is 
     a Generic Rule. Upon the adoption of this Rule all Rules are 
     Generic.
   
     The Wizard shall maintain a record of the Number of each
     non-Generic Rule and its associated Stylishness.  E shall publish
     this record at least once every two weeks.

{Comment: Removed the Rulekeepor from this since a) e has enough work,
          and b) There's no real reason e needs to maintain the 
          information since the Wizard is the one who acts on it.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Changes to Rules' Stylishness}

     Whenever a Proposal is adopted that changed the Proposer's Style, 
     every Rule that the Proposal amended shall have its Stylishness
     change by the same amount, and every Rule that the Proposal created
     shall have its Stylishness set equal to that amount.

     Every week, the Wizard shall randomly select one Generic Rule that 
     does not list the Player currently holding the Office of Wizard in 
     its Attribution.  When the Wizard selects this Rule e shall assign 
     it a new Stylishness based on the same criteria e uses for 
     proposals.  This new Stylishness shall be an integral value between 
     -3 and 3, not including zero.

     When a Rule's Stylishness changes, the Wizard shall record the 
     change and the reason for it.  E is required to publish these 
     changes in the Public Forum as soon as possible after they occur.

{Comment: Again, removed the Rulekeepor from this.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: The Style Machine}

     This Rule is known as the Style Machine and may be referred to 
     unambiguously in that manner.  The Executor of the Style Machine is 
     the Wizard.  The Style Machine is a Voting Entity.  Every time the 
     Wizard produces a report listing the Style changes due to
     Proposals, e shall also pay out a number of VTs to the Style
     Machine equal to the number of Proposals in that Report that
     changed their Proposer's Style. The Wizard is only permitted 
     to act on behalf of the Style Machine as explicitly directed in 
     this Rule.

     If the Style Machine possesses VTs, it shall act as follows;
     
       i) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote Against that Proposal.
      ii) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Dull Rules than Stylish 
          Rules the Style Machine shall vote For that Proposal.
     iii) If neither i) or ii) apply, the Style Machine shall Abstain on
          that Proposal.

     If the Style Machine does not possess VTs, it shall act as follows;

      iv) If a Proposal amends or repeals more Stylish Rules than Dull 
          Rules the Style Machine shall not declare its Presence for
          that Proposal.
       v) If iv) does not apply, the Style Machine shall declare its 
          Presence on the Proposal.

     The Wizard must report Votes or declarations of Presence for the 
     Style Machine before the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal 
     in question.

     The Style Machine's votes shall count toward Quorum.  The Style 
     Machine's Votes cannot be changed once made.  This Rule takes
     precedence over the Rules covering Voting Entities and Votes in 
     general.

{Comment: This is now only work for the Wizard.  The extra work IMO is 
          offset by a measure of power e receives by modifying the 
          Stylishness of Rules.  The idea being that Stylish Rules are 
          slightly harder to change than Dull Rules.}
