H. CotC Michael,

I hereby call for Judgement on the following Statement:

Statement:

      Rule 1567 should be interpreted such that a Player may only make
      emself ineligible to Judge a CFJ which has already been called.

Relevant Rules: 1567

Argument:

I begin with the general observation that being eligible to Judge a CFJ
is a Nomic property of Players in the sense of R1011, and hence can only
be changed by procedures specified in the Rules. Hence if the procedure
described in R1567 for changing one's eligibility to Judge a CFJ does
not permit Players to make themselves ineligible to Judge CFJs which
have not yet been called (as I contend), then, since no other Rule
specifies such a procedure, that action is simply not permitted by the
Rules at all, and the Statement is TRUE. 

The first paragraph of R1567 itself states that:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific CFJ
      by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts, specifying
      the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

Attention should be drawn here to two points about this paragraph. The
first is that it describes a procedure for making oneself ineligible to
Judge 'a specific CFJ'. The second point is that the procedure described
requires the the Player to specify 'the CFJ for which e wishes to be
made ineligible'. I submit that a CFJ which has not yet been called and
hence does not yet exist cannot meet the requirements of specificity in
R1567. "All CFJs called in the next two weeks" does not name a specific
CFJ, for example. Neither does "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next
month." Even "Any CFJ called by Chuck in the next three days concerning
the interpretation of Rule 1567" does not, I claim, name a specific CFJ,
even if Chuck actually makes a CFJ matching that description. 'A
specific CFJ' can only refer to a CFJ which already exists in the full
particularity of its details: its text, who called it, and when it was
called.

Motion to Annotate:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of this CFJ that R1567 be
annotated with a copy of the Statement.

And it's too late for me to vacate the delayed TO.  Thanks.  I transfer a
Kudo from myself to Crito for being nice to me.

I transfer 1 VT to the Bank to satisfy the first Payment Order.  The
second will just have to go on my tab, for now...

Ah, right.  In that case, all of those POs are still outstanding and it is my
unfortunate duty to report that Chuck is guilty of Persistent Indebtedness for
Indulgences and order em to pay one Indulgence to the Bank.

H. Scorekeepor, note that Chuck loses 2 points as a result of the above Blot.

Chuck,

Now that it has been reported, why didn't you just go ahead and vacate them
again?
