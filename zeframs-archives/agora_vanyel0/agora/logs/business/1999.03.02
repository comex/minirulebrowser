I hereby set the Voting Tariff, for next week onwards, to 0.5 VTs. 

I would like to encourage the Chancellor to turn the BOS back up to a
reasonable level, say 2 or 3 VTs.

Judge Morendil has claimed that I did not forward to him General Chaos'
Motion concerning CFJ 1120 (calling for two POs issued against Vlad to
be vacated). For the record, this is incorrect. The General's Motion was
included as part of his Arguments, and was thus forwarded to Morendil
when the CFJ was re-assigned to him on Sun, 14 Feb 1999 14:04:56 +1100.
Morendil is thus technically in breach of R1827 for failing either to
grant or deny the Motion within five days of receiving it.

This means that this CFJ remains open (there is an outstanding
judicial motion has been neither granted nor denied).  Morendil
appears to be refusing to rule on those motions.  Therefore, I call
for his removal as Judge of that CFJ per Rule 1756.  I also call for
the review of Morendil's failure to discharge a judicial duty, per
Rule 1564.  Let's exercise these little-used Rules to see what other
nits fall out. :)

(I personally believe that Morendil is still empowered to act on those 
motions; exceeding the time limit does not disable him from acting,
but merely makes his failure to act in time a Rule Violation.)
