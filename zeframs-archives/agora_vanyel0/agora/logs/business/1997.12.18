Wizard Gen. Chaos seems to think that Proposal 3645 doesn't work, claiming
that it fails to amend out the language in Rule 408 that makes a late judge
ineligible.  I wish to refute this so that players in favor of the idea
will not ignore it or vote AGAINST.


>======================================================================
>Proposal 3645 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

>Amend Rule 408 to read:
>
>      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
>      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
>      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days

Unchanged except for adding a formal definition of the end of the "assigned
deliberation period."


>      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
>      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
>      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT

>      late.

The crux of the proposal.  Late judgements are legal but penalized.


>      Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes
>      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in
>      the usual manner.

A late judge becomes ineligible when the CotC says so.


>      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
>      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
>      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
>      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted

A _very_ late judge (more than 7 days late) is automatically ineligible.
This should not happen unless the CotC is very lax.  But there should be
some limit to how lax we allow em to be.


>      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
>      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither
>      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or

Same idea as before, absolving ineligible judges from further responsibility.

Disclaimer : announcing a Vote on 3640 may or may
not be effective in casting a Vote, and irrespective
of that it may or may not be a violation of Rule
1729 - my attempt at such a Move makes no representation
as to the legality of it.
