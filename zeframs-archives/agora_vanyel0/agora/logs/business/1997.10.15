H. CotC Andre,

I hereby claim that the Judge selections in CFJs 1055-1058 are all
in error, in that Kolja was not On Hold at the time the CFJs were
assigned Judges.

Statement: Elde is in violation of Rule 478 in that e is not 
           able to receive messages sent to the Public Forum.

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Elde can not be held to be in violation of any rules as he is no
longer a Player, having been deregistered on 4 October, before the
date on which this CFJ was called.

Evidence:

The following e-mail alleged Elde's lawlessness.  This having
subsequently been confirmed by the Herald (in message with id
<s43a326d.055@rmv.state.ma.us>, dated Tue, 07 Oct 1997 12:59:43
-0400), the deregistration of Elde happened at the time of this
message.

My understanding of the current Currency uncertainties is that while the
actual number of Blots around is in dispute, there is little if any chance
that anyone has much less Blots than what the Herald has reported.

Therefore, I believe that I should be safe from accusations of Persecution
due to what follows. I just hope I won't have to eat my words. :-)

The latest Herald's Report recorded Elde as having 25 Blots. Since then,
he has committed 5 Infractions of failing to Judge. So, if I have done my
research correctly, he now "officially" has 25 + 5*3 = 40 Blots. 

As I said above, there is little chance that he has much less. In
particular, he certainly has more than 30 Blots. 

I hereby allege that Elde is Lawless. 

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I hereby admit this claim. As is long-standing tradition among CotCs
I reassign these CFJs in the following way:
Selecting a number from 1 to n, where n is the number of eligible
players, including Kolja, and reassign the CFJ to Kolja if this number
is n, keep it with the old Judge otherwise.

	n  random number
1055:	14  3
1056:	17  8
1057:	17 11
1058:	17  5

So all these CFJs are still assigned to the same Judges.

The relevant part of these CFJs should read:

======================================================================

In the case of CFJ 1055:

Eligible:    Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito,
             General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Oerjan, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:
Barred:      Andre, elJefe, Steve
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     

======================================================================

In the case of CFJs 1056-1058:


Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito,
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Morendil

Proto-Proposal
Majority Appeal decisions

[Comment: in a couple of CFJs recently, we have seen a majority of
the Justices agree to overturn a decision - only to have the CFJ
then reassigned because of the way R1693 is worded. I propose to
fix this problem. In general, I have tried to make clearer the
relationship between the rulings of individual Justices and the
Board's ruling.]]

Be it hereby resolved that R1693 be amended to read:

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which the Justices unanimously
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but a majority of the Justices do not agree
      on what action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as
      above.
