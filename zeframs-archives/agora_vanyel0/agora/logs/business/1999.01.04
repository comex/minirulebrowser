Acting as Executor and on behalf of Blob, I submit the following
Repeal-O-Matic selection process, which was delayed by last week's
Holiday.

I count 312 Rule in the Current Rule set.  Here are the five random selections:

122 = Rule 1786 Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of Margins
150 = Rule 1562 Excess CFJs
 31 = Rule 1432 Player Uniqueness
 35 = Rule 1016 Putting Oneself on Hold
209 = Rule  649 Patent Titles

Hmm.  Is it me, or is the R-O-M starting to repeat itself a lot?
I'll select Rule 1786, just for fun.  So, acting as Blob's Executor
acting as the R-O-M's Executor, I hereby submit the following
proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1786 (Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of Margins)
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
                     Rule 1786 is hereby Repealed.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of Blob, I submit the following
Proposal distribution, delayed by last week's Holiday.

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report. 
The Voting Periods for these Proposals commence as of this
message and end on Mon, 11 January, 1999.  Voting on these
proposals will cost 0 VTs.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
S = Sane
E = Emergency
I = Insane
U = Urgent

   No.  Proposer      AI Name
   ---  --------      -- ----
   3821 Blob           1 Let everyone have a turn
   3822 Crito          1 Honour without Dishonour
 
======================================================================
39. Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Let everyone have a turn

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.
]
======================================================================
57. Proposal  (Crito) AI = 1
Honour without Dishonour

Let the following Rule be created with Power = 1;

Herald's Privilege

      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the increase.
      At the same time as e makes this announcement, the Herald shall
      record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of said Player.

[A nice perk for the Herald, and a way to recognize honorable acts
of Players without requiring a 'victim'.  I deliberately left the
allowable justifications to the discretion of the Herald.]

I note that these proposals were distributed with numbers that may be
conected to their position in the queue or something, but not with
their propsal number:

>>
39. Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
[snip]
57. Proposal  (Crito) AI = 1
<<

I hope that doesn't affect the validity of the distribution. Assuming
that it doesn't, (H. Assessor, please note), I hereby cast one vote for
P3822.

Morendil made the comment before I went on holidays, that the 
"Long Term Voting Experiment" should be an action Without Objection,
so as to bring it somewhere between a pure discretionary power and
a popular vote. I agree with him, that it should be a little more
controlled in this way, but I think he has the wrong idea about WO
actions if he thinks they will achieve this. 

Actions Without Objection lie somewhere in the "majority opinion" to
"unanimous consent" end of the spectrum. They may seem very close 
to discretionary powers, but that is only because most of these
actions are inconsequential. 

So to remedy this situation, and allow for actions with support 
in the lower half of the spectrum, I proto the following rule,
which mirrors the Without Objection Rule.

Blob

-----
Proto Proposal: Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.
