I hereby transfer 10 VTs to the Bank to repay this vacated PO.
Q: Should there be a suset clause to this mechanisim-- I mean, shoul
a Player (in a hypothetical case) be liable to pay back a PO that
might be vacated two or three months after the fact?

As required by R1734, since the above mentioned POs were already satisfied, I
hereby issue the following reversal POs:

elJefe is ordered to pay 10 VTs to the Bank.
Blob is ordered to pay 10 VTs to the Bank.
Steve is ordered to pay 10 VTs to the Bank.
G.Chaos is ordered to pay 10 VTs to the Bank.
Swann is ordered to pay 10 VTs to the Bank.

This transfer did not accomplish the purpose specified because the reversal PO
had not yet been issued at the time this TO was executed.  You can't repay the
vacated PO, you have to pay the reversal PO, which I have just sent to the PF.

H. Chancellor take note:  R1754 imposes an obligation on you to transfer these
10 VTs back to Swann.

Rule Conflict Resolution - One to One or One to Many?

Ok, looking at Rules 1482 and 1030 it seems clear to me that Steve and Scott
are correct - Rule conflicts are not restricted to one on one direct conflicts.
R1482 is slightly ambiguous on this point, but R1030 explicitly says "two or
more Rules" when talking about conflicts.

As far as the proposal queue is concerned then, the question of whether a
proposal may be removed from the queue depends on the difference between an
indefinite postponement of voting and "impossible" voting, and whether
"impossible" means "impossible under the current Ruleset" or "impossible under
all possible Rulesets".

I agree that making voting impossible creates a conflict and that an indefinite
postponement does not.  I also tend to favor Scott's argument that "impossible"
should be interpreted as "impossible under the current Ruleset", given the
precedent established for CFJ calls.  Given this, I will not remove any
Proposals from the queue until such time as this conflict is resolved in a way
that allows it (or a CFJ overturns this interpretation).  This puts Harlequins
"Electees" Proposal back in the Queue.  However, since e vacated the TO that
raised its priority, we are back to another issue.  What are the effects of a
TO?  

H. CotC, to clear this up, I am going to call the following CFJ:

    The Proposal titled "Electees" submitted by Harlequin on 02 April, 1998
    had a priority of one as of 09 April, 1998.

Arguments:

    Harlequin payed one P-Note at the time e submitted this Proposal in order
    to raise the priority to one.  Although e later vacated that particular
    Transfer Order, the priority of "Electees" had already been raised, and
    there is no Rule that causes the priority to be reduced when the TO is
    vacated.  The argument has been put forth that R1802 accomplishes this.
    However, I contend that R1802 causes a vacated Order to be deprived of its
    direct effect, that of placing an obligation on someone to perform some
    action, but does cause the reversal any collateral effects that occured
    only indirectly, as a result of the action having been performed.  To 
    support this view, I point to the Rules for vacating Payment Orders that
    have been satisfied.  The Rules indicate that the indirect effects of a
    vacated PO, causing a TO to be issued and a transfer to have occurred, are
    not simply reversed by the vacation of the PO.  Instead a new PO must be
    issued and another transfer take place to complete the vacation.
