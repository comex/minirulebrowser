I hereby do declare that I have just finished reading the entire Ruleset
by whispering it, and that I have done so without any drugs other than
Coca-Cola, pizza, chewing gum (mint) and chocolate covered peanuts.

In the process, I have collected a number of errors, mostly
spelling/grammar errors and a few anachronisms, which I will try to turn
into a Proto or four.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

There is no legal requirement to post Transfer Orders to the Public
Forum.  It is possible (in fact, probable) that you have in fact
transferred two P-Notes to Oerjan.
