I've been convinced both by General Chaos's arguments and a re-reading
of R478 that effective time of messages should probably be the time
the message was sent.

Therefore I hereby vacate RIPO1.  (Hon. Herald, in case you haven't
been paying attention, that's the PO requiring Chuck to pay the Bank
an Indulgence that appears in the e-mail message with ID:
<E0y4N5U-0007Qi-00@merganser.cl.cam.ac.uk>)

This Week with R-O-M

I show 303 Rules in the current Rule set.  Here are the random drawings this
week:

249 = Rule 1437 Fugitives from Justice
 29 = Rule  113 Players may always opt out
 98 = Rule  879 Quorum
 64 = Rule 1339 Precision in Rule Changes
219 = Rule 1696 Voting Tokens

Hmm.  No good choices this week, looks like to me.  You shouldn't be able to
deregister and reregister to avoid penalties easily and trying to repeal Quorum
or Voting Tokens is a sure recipe for a failed proposal (besides, that VT thing
has been done already 8).  I guess I'll choose Rule 113 this week.  You can't
really prevent people from dropping out of the game anyway (even if you can
prevent them from deregistering officially).
