Protoproposal: A Longer Term Voting Experiment

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing mode
      for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)   i) The Assessor may determine the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals. 

       ii) The Registrar may determine the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections. 

      iii) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) To change the prevailing mode of voting, the relevant Officer
      must post to the Public Forum before midnight GMT on Thursday
      morning, announcing the change and the new mode of voting. The
      change comes into effect at the beginning of the next Nomic 
      Week.

  (d) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (e)   i) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       ii) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

      iii) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

  (f) This Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a Proposal 
      if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.
]

BTW: Any comments on the layout? Gen Chaos' numbered clauses seemed
appropriate.

PROPOSAL
Spring Cleaning

[Corrections of various errors found during Read the Ruleset Week, and
a few found while preparing this Proto.

I have not included capitalization in this, although it is a mess.
That may be a separate Proto.

I also did not try to standardize between "a SLC" and "an SLC".
I _did_ include corrections of "he/his" to "e/eir".

I have divided the Proto into "Basic grammar and spelling", which
should be fairly uncontroversial changes, and "Various", which may or
may not be so.

I'll check what AI this needs at a later stage.

2: Many changes, mostly removing provisions that have become
unnecessary due to other Proposals.  For a while I kept track of newly
introduced errors as well, but I have mostly given up on this - I did
find one by chance during the latest check.  The Proto title is no
longer fitting, alas, but maybe I can get this proposed before it
becomes so again.

3: Final cleanup.]

Part 2: Various


Amend Rule 1023 ('Definition of "As Soon As Possible"') by replacing

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

with

           if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

           otherwise, e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

[I find the current formulation illogical.
2: Steve found my reformulation illogical.  Let's see if removing the
indices helps.]

[2: Rule 1645 was disinfected.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1659 was amended by the Electee reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1626 ("Applications") by replacing the paragraph reading

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

with

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

[The rest of the Rule defines Signatures Platonically, in such a way
that an Application cannot contain illegal ones.]

Amend Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges") by replacing the paragraph
reading

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

with

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

[The original Rule only requires the penalty to be reported, not the
Infraction.]

If the last and second last paragraphs of Rule 1575 ("Standards of
Proof") are identical, delete the last paragraph.

[They certainly look identical to me...]

[2: Rules 663 and 1564 were repealed and amended, respectively, by the
Omnibus Reform.  Provisions removed.]

[2: Rule 1695 was amended by the Omnibus Reform.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1504 was amended.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 417 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1710 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1763 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1713 was amended by the Omnibus Reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1637 ("Wills") by replacing "treasury" with "entity".

[Old terminology.]

Amend Rule 1662 ("The Speaker's Gratuity") by replacing "At the end of
every month" with "After the end of every month".

[The current formulation could be taken to imply that the Registrar
has to pay out at an exact moment.  While there is game custom to the
contrary, this is still not a good formulation.]

[2: Rule 1682 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") by removing the text ", or which would
allow em to reregister".

[The Pardoning system does not work due to this.  It doesn't help
having a precedence clause when the lowered-numbered Rule you are
trying to trump also has one...]

Amend Rule 1747 ("Pardoning Lawlessness") to read

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

["He/his" and some bad timing requirements have been changed.
2: Steve had some comments on the substance of this Rule, however, I
believe that is beyond the scope of this Proposal, so no change due to
this.]

Amend Rule 1439 ("Blots Due to a CFJ") by replacing the text

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

with

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ. 

[Fixes a missing period and makes the Rule PC compliant.]

Amend Rule 1658 ("Tainting the Speaker") by replacing "permitted to
call such a Referendum" with "authorized to call such a Referendum".

[With all the Rule 116/1011 debates I don't feel that the word
"permitted" has enough weight for this purpose.]

[2: Rule 681 was amended.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1590 ("Maintainer of SLCs") and Rule 1531 ("Administrators
and Their Duties") by replacing each instance of "Compact" with "SLC".

[Old terminology.]

[2: Rule 1651 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Not quite correct. You have to issue a Budget before the end of
Nominating Period, but it doesn't have to be together with one's
nomination.

A further note on Holidays. It seems clear that once one has nominated,
the deadline for delivering the Budget is extended until 24 hours after
the end of the Holiday.

What the hell. I hereby nominate for Treasuror.

The Treasuror 

     There exists an Office called the Treasuror, with a salary equal
     to zero. 

     The Treasuror is elected like any other Office, except that 
     sometime during the Nominating period for the Office, Nominees
     must issue a Budget. Any Nominee who has not issued a Budget is
     not a Candidate for that Election. This rule takes precedence
     over any other rule which may identify Candidates.
     
     A Budget is a list of all Players' names, each with a corresponding
     number of VTs. The number of VTs must be an integral multiple
     of the MUQ of VTs, and cannot be less than zero. The sum of all
     these amounts must be less than or equal to 50 VTs.

     A Budget is issued by posting it to the Public Forum. A Nominee 
     may issue as many Budgets as e wishes, but only the latest Budget
     issued during the Nominating Period of the Election is allowed 
     to be implemented.

     As soon as possible after the Treasuror is elected, e must
     implement eir Budget. E does so by posting it to the Public Forum
     and announcing that e is implementing it. Only the last valid
     Budget e issued in the Nomination Period can be implemented in
     this way.

     At the time the Budget is thus implemented, all outstanding
     Payment Orders are vacated, and all Players' VT holdings are
     set to the values shown in the Budget. The VT holdings of all
     other entities are set to zero, except for the Bank, which 
     shall contain 50VTs.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
     these changes from being made.

     One week after the Budget has been implemented, this Rule shall
     repeal itself.
