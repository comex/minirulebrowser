If P3796 passes, who do I pay out the P-Notes to? Do I pay them to the
Repeal-O-Matic, as the submitting entity, or to myself, as the Player
who actually submitted them.

Since I neglected to include arguments at the time, I will note for
the Judge's benefit that my entire argument is that there does not
appear to be any decent evidence to support the claim that I control
at least 3 VTs.  Honestly, I don't have any idea how many VTs I
control.  I can't see how Blob can have any reasonable idea either,
and it seems improper to me for em to conclude that I do control at
least 3 VTs without some credible evidence to support that conclusion.
