These currency rules will make me crazy some day. Or better, they already
have done so...

I hereby issue a Transfer Order of 1 Proposal Note to Peekee, to satisfy
the Payment Order above.

And thanks for notifying...

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.

The following Proposal is to be titled "Let the Promotor Exercise
Judgment" and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.
