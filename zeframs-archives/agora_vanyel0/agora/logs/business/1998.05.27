This Week with R-O-M

I count 347 Rules in the latest Rule set.  Here are the five random selections:

  6 = Rule  754 Spelling and Grammar Errors
135 = Rule 1796 Validity of Orders
196 = Rule 1814 Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions
236 = Rule 1730 Delayed Transfer Orders
207 = Rule 1691 Category of New Rules

I have always tried to honor them in the past, but Delayed Transfer Orders are
actually something of a pain.  The only other reference to them in the Rules is
in Happy Birthday and I will add a provision to this proposal to clean that up
too.  So, I hereby select Rule 1730 for the R-O-M this week.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal and pay one P-Note from the R-O-M to the Bank to increase
its priority by one:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1730 is hereby Repealed.

Rule 1727 is amended by replacing the text

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with the text

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as soon as possible after Agora's
      Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, submit
      Transfer Orders to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs each;

Proto: Repair & Retune Plots (v0.1)

This is a proto to fix Plots and to try to integrate them with our
current economic environment. Basically it attempts to do the following:

1) Repair some simple bugs in the Plot rules, such as the timing of
   Maintenance and Production.

2) Pragmatise the creation, destruction and transfer of Plots. (Only
   half done.)

3) Adjust some values to fit in better with rates of supply & demand.

4) Give the Cartographor some leverage over the Plots economy.

5) Maintain a "least committment" level of play for those players 
   with little time for Officer-ship or Plot maintenance.

Maybe this is a little over-ambitious, and should be divided into
more than one proposal. What do others think?

This is still work in progress. "Comments" indicate those things I
have already changed. "Notes" indicate things that still need to be
fixed. Any suggestions would be welcomed.

Just how long have we been working on this thing?

Blob

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "The Crown" with the text:

      There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Crown. 
      The Cartographor is the Executor of the Crown.

{Comments: The Crown is the Bank-equivalent for Plots. The important
 difference is that the Crown is under the control of the Cartographor,
 not the Chancellor. Rules below are amended appropriately.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with the text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  

      New Plots are created when the Cartographor posts to the Public
      Forum that e is creating new Plots, specifying the number that 
      e is creating.  The newly created Plots are in the possession of
      the Crown. 

      Plots are destroyed when any entity which possesses them 
      transmits to the Cartographor a notice that e is destroying them,
      specifying the number of Plots that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more Plots than e possesses, however.  The units 
      destroyed are removed from the possession of the entity 
      performing the destruction.

      When a Plot is created, its creator shall give it a unique name.  
      A Plot's owner may change its name Without Objection, provided 
      that the new name is unique.

{Comments: Plots are created and destroyed pragmatically. The Cartographor
 is free to name new Plots as e sees fit - all formal notions of Adjacency
 are omitted.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "The Cartographor" with the text:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, and ownership of all Plots
        * the ownership, type and assignment of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, type or assignment of all 
          Structures since the last Report

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a Rule entitled "Separation of Powers" with the text:

      If a Player is ever both Chancellor and Cartographor at the
      same time, then e must resign from one or other of these 
      Offices as soon as possible.

{Comments: The Cartographor will have economic leverage, like the 
 Chancellor. This Rule is designed to keep too much power from settling
 in one pair of hands.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1843 ("Buying and Selling Plots") to read:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 Ergs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Crown-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Crown-owned Plot by
      transferring the Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the
      sole purpose of buying that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other
      consenting entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes
      to do so.  For the purposes of this Rule, the Crown is always
      deemed to consent to such wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as
      possible after a Plot is transferred to the Crown in this way,
      the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's Market Value to
      the transferring entity.

{Comments: No free Plots. Plot prices are in Ergs, because I feel that
 is a more appropriate medium.}

{Note: Transfers need to be Pragmatised. Transfers from the Crown must
 only be when the rules require them.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1844 ("Winning by Ownership") to read:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Crown,
      and all Plots not owned by the Crown are owned by a single
      entity, then that entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition
      known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by
      the Crown.

{Comments: This is not as destructive as I first thought, because only
 one Player loses any Plots, and that is the Winner. Still, winning in
 this way is a double-edged sword.}

{Note: The second paragraph is very platonic. How do we fix it?}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1845 ("Structures") to read:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each
      Structure is assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.
      No entity may own more than five Structures, unless another Rule
      specifies otherwise.

{Comments: No change as yet.}

{Note: Need to add a restriction on number of Structres assigned to a 
 Plot.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule ("Ergs") to read:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 0.1.  Their Recordkeepor is
      the Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

{Comment: Changed the MUQ to 0.1, in order to allow more flexibility
 in setting the Maintenance Fee.}

{Note: Check on new-player erg values. Should be enough to buy 1 Plot
 and 1 Structure, perhaps with a little left over for the first few
 week's Maintenance.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1848/0 (Power=1)
Types of Structures

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.
      E must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the
      Structure is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens,
      the Cartographor shall bill that Player the price of that Type
      of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.
      E must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon
      as possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out
      to that Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

{Note: What if a player transfers a Plot with a Structure to another
 player who already owns 5 Structures?}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1849 ("Maintenance of Structures") to read:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance
      Fees of all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of
      Structure e owns, at the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after having made all Production payments
      for a given week, the Cartographor shall bill each Player's 
      Maintenance Fee to that Player.

{Comments: Maintenance has to be billed _after_ Production is paid.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1850/0 (Power=1)
Production of Structures

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall pay out each Structure's Production to its
      owner, excluding Structures whose Type changed during that Week,
      and excluding Players with a Maintenance Fee that is neither
      satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

{Note: This does not appear to need to be changed.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule 1851 ("Standard Types of Structures") to read:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified
      prices, and Productions:

        Type       Price      Production 
        ---------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     0.5 VTs       
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note   
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs     
        Church     4 Ergs     special    

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to
      be given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two
      Players, and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a
      Church is instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule attempting to prevent Churches from
      having this effect.

      All Structures have the same Maintenance Fee, which is set by
      the Cartographor, as defined in another rule.

{Comment: Farm produciton has been lowered to bring it more in line 
 with curreny economic environment. Maintenance Fees are now under 
 the control of the Cartographor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a rule entitled "The Cartographor can set Maintenance Fees."
with text:

      The Cartographor can set the value of the Maintenance Fee for
      Structures by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, 
      provided that e announces a value between 0 Ergs and 2 Ergs
      inclusive, that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT 
      Thursday, and that the Maintenance Fee has not already been set
      by a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

{Comment: Same mechanism as the Chancellor's control over the BOS.
 This should allow the Cartographor some leverage over the Plots side
 of the economy.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a rule with the title "Officers may not own plots" and the text: 

      If at any time a Player has held an Office in the normal fashion
      without interruption for more than two weeks, ownership of any Plots 
      this Player owned at that time is transferred to the bank. This
      transfer occurs even if other Rules do not allow it.

      As soon as possible after this transfer of ownership the Chancellor
      shall pay out to this Player Nationalization Damages of half
      the Market Value of all Plots transferred to the Bank, and 2 Ergs
      per Structure on these Plots.

{Comments: Stolen from Kolja's proto. Reduces the dominance of Officers.}

{Note: Transfers are too Platonic.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Amend Rule #### ("Unemployment Benefits") to read:

      Any Player who is not an Officer and who does not own any Plots
      is said to be unemployed.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the
      Registrar shall pay out an unemployment benefit of half the 
      Basic Officer Salary to every unemployed Player

{Comments: Keep unemployment benefits as a "least committment" level
 of Play, so that players who don't have time to do more "work" - 
 either Official Duties or Plot maintenance & trading, can still 
 participate in the game.

 It is up to the Cartographor to tune the Maintenance Fees to make
 Plot ownership more attractive than unemployment. This could result
 in some interesting dynamics.}
