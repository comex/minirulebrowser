This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Restore Sanity" and is to have
Adoption Index 2.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each
          Proposal.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message
          to the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the
          Proposal upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from Voting
            upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then in
            effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall receive
a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subdivision (a) of this Rule
          twice in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same
          Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this
          right three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
word "zero" with "one" wherever it appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1442, 1765, 1715, 1824, 1660, 1760,
1723, 1724, 1772 and 1862 be repealed.


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Every Man Is an Island" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617, 1458
and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738 and 1757 be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Unlimited Voting" and is to
have Adoption Index 2.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660 and 1765 be repealed.


**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Oh, what a tangled web...."
and is to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
          but only if it bears a clear indication that it is intended
          to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Some Housecleaning" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Down with Playerism!" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each entity who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.
