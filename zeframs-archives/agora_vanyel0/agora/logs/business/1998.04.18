This sentence does not make sense, So I vote AGAINST this proposal. Let
em submit a readable amendment.

Yeah, sounds OK. I vote FOR this proposal.

Yeah, why not.  I vote FOR this one.

This should have a clause to remove the rule if it get's left blank as a
result of these 2 proposals. But I vote FOR anyway.

FOR. This looks usable to us in our great Internomic plan :o)

I have previously stated that I am a bit of a stickler for the letter of
the law. The Proposal posted for voting was not the same as the Proposal
originally submitted. Therefore, I feel bound to uphold the judgement.

It's good to have something to do :o)

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following statement:

     If a Player with nonzero Score deregisters and later re-registers,
     eir Score is the same as it was when e deregistered.


Caller's arguments:  Rule 1775 says "Only a Player can have a Score" but
doesn't say what happens when an ex-Player re-registers.  As a candidate
for Scorekeepor, I'd like to know whether Time Agent will get his Score
of -13 back if e ever re-registers.


List of relevant Rules:


Rule 1775/0 (Power=1)
Points and Scoring

      Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value
      known as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an
      integer.  If the rules specify a non-integral change in a
      Player's Score, that change shall be rounded to the nearest
      integer before being applied.

      Only a Player can have a Score.

      Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or
      loss of Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that
      number is to be added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number
      of Points means that number is to be subtracted from a Player's
      Score.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with
      Points and Scoring.
