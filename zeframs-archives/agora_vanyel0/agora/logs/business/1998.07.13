Indeed, there was a double transcription error there for both Threat and the X
Group.

>Threat is hereby commanded to pay 3.5 VTs to the Bank.
>X Group is hereby commanded to pay 0.2 VTs to the Bank.

Both of the above orders were in error and are amended as follows:

Threat is now commanded to pay 0.2 VTs to the Bank.
X Group is now commanded to pay 0.8 VTs to the Bank.
