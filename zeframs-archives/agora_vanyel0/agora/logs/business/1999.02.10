I judge FALSE.  I find that the Proposal was indeed distributed as the
Statement suggests, but at the time the CFJ was called it had been given a
number, namely 3833.

This judgement is based on the following findings, some of which relate to
Caller's argument.

1. The Promotor attempted to distribute Vlad's proposal "The Grand Agoran
Tournament" at two separate times on 08 Feb 1999 (GMT), namely at 01:22:57
GMT ("OFF: Proposals 3830-3832") and at 02:03:24 GMT ("OFF: Proposal 3833")

Note that this does not mean that there are two Proposals; under 1483 there
was no creation of any new Proposal with the same text.

2. At the time of the first message, the Promotor attempted to give the
number 3830 to the Proposal, but this number had already been used before,
and the attempted assignment failed as contrary to Rule 109.

By Rule 1770, the "legal effects" of distribution took place anyway. These
include the start of the Voting Period on the unnumbered Proposal (Rule
693) and its removal from the Proposal Queue (Rule 1770).

3. Even though the Promotor failed to follow Rule 109 at the time of
distribution, this does not deprive a later assignment of a number to the
unnumbered Proposal from having effect.  

Game Custom and (I believe) earlier Judgements have held that a Rule which
prescribes a Player action "at" a particular time does not thereby prevent
an omitted action from being performed at a later time (though other Rules
may explicitly prevent it). Indeed, the Caller is assuming this in eir
request for an order to compel such an action.

4. The caller argues that the Promotor did not give the number 3833 to the
Proposal, but to the "second issue" of the Proposal. This is wrong: numbers
are given to Proposals, not to 'issues' of Proposals. As noted, there are
not two Proposals under discussion but only one.

5. The second message gives evidence that sometime after 01:22:57 GMT and
no later than 02:03:24 GMT, the Promotor attempted to give number 3833 to
the Proposal. The Promotor's mistaken belief about the status of the
Proposal does not affect the assignment of the number.

6. Rule 109 requires the number to be the least integer greater than the
numbers previously assigned.  After the first message, 3831 and 3832 had
already been assigned. So 3833 is the correct number, and the attempt to
give it to the Proposal was successful.

DICTUM: With regards to Vlad's vote:  reasonable (if slightly inattentive)
people could be confused about which Proposal was meant by "Proposal 3830"
in the context in which Vlad attempted to vote. Thus I could support a
judgement that Vlad's attempt to vote was ambiguous.

elJefe, J.

==========================================================================
                               CFJ 1122

  Proposal "3833" (see below) was not properly distributed and is not in
  fact currently up for vote.

==========================================================================

Called by:           Vlad

Judge:               Michael
Judgement:           FALSE

Reasons and arguments: 

As elJefe has made clear in his judgement of CFJ1121, there was only
ever one proposal.  In his statement, Vlad refers to it as Proposal
"3833".  This proposal is the same proposal that was on the queue, and
this is also the proposal that was distributed by General Chaos on
Monday (GMT) in the message with ID:
<199902080122.UAA20666@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

This proposal wasn't distributed with a proper number initially, only
gaining one when General Chaos's second post was made, but this
retrospective correction, did not deny the original distribution of
legal effect.  Hence the proposal that Vlad refers to was properly
distributed, and is up for vote.

Therefore I enter a judgement of FALSE.
