H. Promotor, please note that I hereby submit the following proposal
(all of this mail is one proposal only):

---
Abolish P-notes by making the following rule changes:


1727: replace the string "one P-note each from the Bank to each Player
who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's BIrth" (in the last
paragraph but two of version 2 of this rule) by "one Voting Token each
from theBank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during
Agora's Birthday"

replace the string " and shall pay out to each such Contest 5
VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each" (in the last
paragraph but one of version 2 of this rule) by "and shall pay out to
each such Contest 5 Voting Tokens."


1451: in the first sentence of the second paragraph, "The Assessor
shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one P-Note.", replace "one
P-note" with "two Voting Tokens".

[It might be simpler to repeal this rule altogether, but then 1065
becomes kind of useless.]


947: replace the string "the Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the
Proposer of that Proposal." by "the Rulekeepor shall pay out one
Voting Token to the Proposer of that Proposal."


1678: replace the string "If an Interested Proposal passes," by "If a
Proposal passes,"


1047: replace the string "When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some
Player" by "When a Proposal Proposed by some Player".

replace the string "the Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that
Player." by "the Assessor shall pay out one Voting Token to that Player."


1705: replace the string "the Wizard shall pay out to each Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of P-Notes
equal to half their Style," by "the Wizard shall pay out to each
Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of Voting Tokens
equal to a third of their Style,"

Change the title of 1705 to "Voting Tokens for Style".


1723: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested", and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three."


1724: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested" and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by
two.

[Question re 1723 and 1724: should a price for making such proposals
reintroduced? How can that be done without keeping the whole petition
fee mechanism just for this purpose?]


1036: replace the string "accompanied by its Number, the identity of
its Proposing Entity, and a clear indication of whether the Proposal
is Disinterested." by "accompanied by its Number and the identity of
its Proposing Entity."


1729: replace the string "An Interested Proposal is Insane," by "Any
Proposal submitted is Insane,"

[Anyone have a better change? I tried to preserve the meter, though
there isn't a clear metric structure of this rule, anyway.]

---

Repeal the following rules:

833 (Awards & Penalties for Proposals)
1583 (Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players)
1701 (Proposal Notes)
1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals)
1623 (Disinterested Proposals)

---

[Comment:

On some occasions P-note rewards or fees are replaced by VT awards,
e.g. 1727, 1451.

In some of these cases I have reduced the amount of VTs, because I
think they are more valuable than P-Notes used to be. Maybe this
could be done even more rigorously.]

3558 General Chaos    Contract Law
3559 Murphy           Clarify Judge Eligibility

                      [Movement must be to an existing Location]

                        destruction of Applications in certain situations,
                        and have other odd conceptualizations that are at
                        odds with common sense."  -General Chaos]
3566 General Chaos    [Champion's Rewards paid out by Registrar, not
                       Assessor]
3568 General Chaos    PI Amnesty
                      [Rule 1713 is disabled till December 1, 1997]

Kolja A. submits a proto that would repeal P-Notes and the concept

* October 29:

Oerjan re-Proposes "Exorcise Probate".

Swann attempts to submit the following Proposals:
  1) The Repeal-O-Matic Rule:  Each week the Promotor randomly chooses
     five Rules, selects one to three of them, and the ROMR Proposes
     their repeal.
  2) Repeals Without Objection:  All Players are empowered to repeal
     any Rule over which the RWOR takes precedence, Without Objection.
  3) Duty-Free Days:  Once per term, the Speaker may declare a period

     required of Players (not including fines for Crimes or Infractions)
     are suspended.


RECENT CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

* October 23:

CFJ 1014 "This statement is TRUE."
         Dismissed by Michael per Rule 1565 (iii)
CFJ 1047 "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial."
         Previously Judged TRUE
         Justiciar elJefe moves to overturn/reverse

* October 25:

CFJ 1060 [paraphrased] "Ross Morgan-Linial did not transfer a Kudo
                        from Harlequin on <date>."
         Judged FALSE by General Chaos

* October 26:

CFJ 1014 Dismissal published
CFJ 1058 "elJefe committed the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime,
          in incorrectly alleging in the Public Forum that Morendil was
          Lawless on October 14."
         ChrisM defaults
         Reassigned to General Chaos
CFJ 1059 "Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
          Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit
          declaration that a particular Player is Lawless."
         Judged TRUE by elJefe, who adds eir belief that "Player X
         has more than 30 Blots" is not such an explicit declaration,
         because verification of its synonymity with "Player X is
         Lawless" requires looking up definitions in the Ruleset.
CFJ 1060 Judgement of FALSE published


OTHER NEWS

Steve points out that Rule 1555 refers to the event (not the condition)
of being deregistered, and thus that it does not cause Morendil to lose
the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Oerjan claims to have been the one who caused Vanyel's deregistration
for inactivity to be delayed.

* October 21:

Murphy posts to the Public Forum and is thereafter Not Absent, whatever
e was previously.

* October 24:

Kolja A. is Elected Ambassador by Acclamation.  Since this preceded
Proposal 3564's adoption, it appears that e later committed the
Infraction of Failure to Report.

Morendil disputes this interpretation with a CFJ, claiming that Rule
1585 and its ASAP timing requirement takes precedence over Rule 1686's
once-every-Nomic-Week timing requirement.  (This reviewer believes that
the CFJ is trivially FALSE due to inaccurate wording.)

* October 26:

Rule 1458 (The Notary) is Disinfected.  The Office of Notary is held
temporarily by Speaker Steve.  Morendil, Elde, and Swann are assigned
Executors in Probate Harlequin, Kolja A., and Steve, respectively;
Blob has not yet been assigned an Executor in Probate.

* October 28:

Vir Rebels.

Uri Bruck becomes a Watcher.

* October 29:

Zefram attempts to make the following Currency transfers:
  0.9 VT to each of Rule 113, the Vototron, the Kudo that favor once
    identified to be buzzing, Plato, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Benjohn
    Barnes, the fyshbowl, Larry Wall, and Screaming Lord Sutch
  1.3 VT to itself
  all eir remaining Currency except 2 VTs to Peter Suber
  one VT to eir other VT
  eir final VT to the VT it possesses
as well as transferring a Kudo from Steve to Vanyel, transferring a
Kudo from General Chaos to Andre, and deregistering; and later CFJing
on the success of some of the Currency transfers (as well as taking
part in an extended argument on the validity of various potential
Currency recipients.

Ackanomic submits the following Internomic proposal:
  Ammend R215 by replacing the string "Rishonomic" with the string
  "New Rishonnomic"
Internomic's policy on misspellings, and thus the potential effect of
this proposal, is not yet determined.

Swann (whose Executor is presumably Steve) claims to re-register,
Rebel, and CFJ on "I (the caller of this CFJ) am my own Executor."

Registrar pro-tem Steve admits Herald Crito's COE on ex-Registrar
Zefram's claim that Crito committed the Infraction of Failure to
Report.  Rule 1733 may grant Steve the power to vacate the relevant
Payment Order; General Chaos points out that a successful CFJ would,
in any case, allow a Judge to vacate it.

KoJen states "I hereby perform every action which is possible for me
to perform in Agora, simultaneously."

* October 30:

Registrar pro-tem Steve initiates Elections for Registrar and Notary.

I am a player and was when I called this CFJ, otherwise there'd be no point

O Promotor, please note that this message contains FOUR (4) Proposals.

Vlad


Proposal V1123:
This Proposal has an AI=1

Pardons
Create a Rule with the following Text:

  The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players. The
Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic month, and may
not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term of office (although, if
re-elected later, he may again Pardon that Player).
	The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by announcing he
is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the following events may
occur:
	1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to eliminate
all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player, and the Herald shall do
so as soon as possible.
	2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any Payment
Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned Player's estate in order
to reduce the number of Blots possessed by the Player's estate to below
the threshhold for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number of
Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no longer Lawless.
	3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player may
immediately reregister.
	4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to ten
Prescribed Words in his Pardon.
	5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during this period he
must apply all Indulgences received (from any source) to his debt and may
not transfer them to another Entity.
	This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or Persistent
Indebtedness.

[I was going to originally make this a prerogative of the Speaker, but
Swann's Proposals would already give the Speaker much power and anyway, to
CotC is not paid enough :-)]
-----------------------------
Proposal V1125:
This Proposal has an AI=1
Reduce Frivolous Appeals

Amend Rule 1447 by appending the following paragraph:

	If a Judgement, Dismissal or Injunction is Appealed, and the Board
of Appeals unanimously upholds the original Judgment, Dismissal or
Injunction, then the Player or Players who initiated the Appeal have
committed the Infraction of Frivolous Appeal, detected and reported by the
CotC, which carries a penalty of one Blot.

[I think Appeals are too readily made. This seems like a relatively
simple and, hopefully, uncontroversial way to address that problem.]
-----------------------------
Proposal V1126:
This Proposal has an AI=1
We Don' Need No Stinking Game Custom!

Amend Rule 217 by removing the phrase "game custom"

-----------------------------
Proposal V1127:
This Proposal has an AI=1
Sunset Stare Decisis

Amend Rule 217 by replacing the phrase "past Judgements" by "past
Judgments handed down within the last six months".

[Note the last two Proposals are independent of one another. Vote for
one, or both, or none, at your pleasure.]

Proto-Proposal V1124:

Make Payment Orders Divisible

Amend Rule 1596 by adding the following paragraph just before the last
paragraph:

	A Payment Order for multiple units of a currency may be treated as
several Payment Orders each for a lesser amount of a Currency, provided
the total number of Currency Units specified in the new Payment Orders is
the same as the number in the old Payment Order, and provided the payor
and payee remain the same. The New Payment Orders are considered to have
been executed at the same time as the original Payment Order. Transfer
Orders that partially satisfy a Payment Order are thus successful, leaving
a smaller Payment Order for the remaining amount of currency. . 

[The idea is straightforward enough: allow combining and dividing PO's.
The problem lies in how to deal with the date of execution. I have not
been able to solve this, so I have limited the Proto to divisibility for
now. Any suggestions on making this work?]

============================================================
PART I: Objects in General

The Rule Category "Currencies" is re-named "Objects"

Rule 1467 has its title change from "Definition of a Currency"
to "Definition of an Object"

Amend Rule 1467 (Definition of a Currency) to read as follows;

     There are entities known as Objects.  An entity is only an 
     Object if the Rules designate it as such.  All Objects, and all
     Classes of Objects conform to the following strictures:

       i) All individual Objects must be a member of one, and only one, 
          Class of Objects explicitly defined in the Rules.
      ii) All individual Objects are owned by one, and only one, entity. 
          Whenever the owner of an individual Object is otherwise
          unspecified, its owner is the Bank.
     iii) All Objects are indivisible. Entities may only own an integral 
          number of Objects.
      iv) An Object that is a member of Class X may be referred to as an
          X. (Where X is the name of the Class of Object.)
       v) Each Class of Objects has a Recordkeepor who must keep a
          current Record of all entities that own Objects belonging to 
          that Class, and the number of those Objects each entity 
          possesses.  If the Rules specify no other Recordkeepor for a
          Class of Objects, that Recordkeepor is the Chancellor.

     This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule defining the 
     properties of Objects or Classes of Objects.

{Comment: This begins a general pragmatic infrastructure to replace the
          current currency bureaucracy.  Currencies are to be replaced
          by Objects, with a much more general structure.
          v0.2 followed some suggestions about language.}


Rule 1576 has its title change from "Names of Currencies" to
"Classes of Objects"

Rule 1576 (Names of Currencies) is amended to read as follows;

     Each Class of Object shall have a name, which must be distinct
     from the name of any other Class of Object.

     Any attempt to create a Class of Object with the same name as an
     already existing Class of Object fails.

     Classes of Objects can only be created by the Rules or by 
     procedure explicitly defined in the Rules.

{Comment: v0.2, added a restriction on the creation of Classes of
          Objects.}

Rule 1577 (Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)) is repealed.
{Comment: Objects are atomic entities.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Legal State and Actual State of Objects}

     Every Object has a "Legal State" and an "Actual State."

     The Actual State of an Object is the state of that Object as 
     recorded by that Object's Recordkeepor.  The Actual State of an 
     Object may only be changed by the Object's Recordkeepor. The Actual 
     State of an Object may never be changed retroactively.

     The Legal State of an Object, is the state of that Object as it 
     would have been Recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect 
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Whenever the Recordkeepor discovers that the Actual State of an 
     Object is not the same as the Legal State of an Object, e is 
     required to alter the Actual state of Objects (Creating, 
     Destroying, and Transferring Objects as needed) to conform the 
     current Actual State of that Objects to the current Legal State of 
     that Object.  This change only applies at the time the change takes 
     place, and does not alter any prior states of that Object, even if 
     those states were not the same as the Legal State of that Object at 
     the time.

     Whenever the Rules refer to the owner of an Object, it means the 
     Actual Owner of that Object.

     This rule takes precedence over any Rule that contradicts its 
     provisions.

     Any changes to an Object's State required by this Rule are detected 
     and Reported by the Recordkeepor in question.

{Comment: v0.2 This rule is needed since a few people seemed confused as 
          to the purpouse of the Legal and Actual state of Objects.  I 
          guess I needed to state explicitly that the Actual State is 
          _it_, if the Recordkeepor says you have a VT, you have a VT, 
          and a future CFJ can't say otherwise. (It can say you weren't
          suposed to have the VT, and the Recordkeepor may transfer it
          back, but that's different than an indeterminate gamestate.)}


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) has its title change from "Currency Recordkeepors"
to "Object Records"


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) is amended to read as follows;

     Every Recordkeepor of a given Class of Objects must, once a week, 
     publish a report that contains a list of all entities that own 
     Objects belonging to that Class, and the number of those Objects 
     each entity possesses. This record of ownership is known as the 
     "Actual State" of those Objects; entities only own Objects as 
     recorded by the Recordkeepor, and Objects exist only in those 
     numbers recorded by the Recordkeepor.

     There is also the "Legal State" of those Objects, which is the 
     record of ownership and number that reflects what the Recordkeepor
     would have recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Within the Class of Objects e records, the Recordkeepor must record 
     every change in ownership or number of Objects that is mandated in 
     the Rules, and e must refrain from recording any change in 
     ownership or number of Objects that is not mandated in the Rules.  
     Willful disregard of this provision is an "Abuse of 
     Responsibility," a Crime defined in other Rules.

     If any Player believes that the Recordkeepor has produced a report 
     that states an Actual State for an Object (or set of Objects) which 
     is not also the Legal State for that Object (or set of Objects), e 
     may produce a Claim of Error alleging this.

     Whenever a CFJ (or an admitted COE) finds that at some point the 
     Actual State of an Object (or set of Objects) was not also the 
     Legal State of that Object (or set of Objects) the Recordkeepor for 
     that Object (or set of Objects) must adjust eir records so that the 
     current Actual State of those Objects conforms to the current Legal
     State of those Objects as specified in the CFJ (or admitted COE).
     This shall never alter any past Actual states of those Objects.

     Object Records can be Ratified. The effect of such Ratification is 
     to change the Legal State of the recorded Objects to conform to the 
     Actual State of those Objects.

{Comment: This is the heart of the pragmatic nature of this proposal.
          Like "ratification" this Rule makes a distinct effort to 
          separate what the Game State is, and what our Reports record.  
          This however goes further by creating a "Legal State" distinct 
          from the "Actual State," this is meant to be an analogue, as 
          closely as possible, to our officers moving physical tokens 
          around-- if the officer makes a mistake and gives someone an 
          Object, the Object is actually given, there is no chance for a 
          game state being indeterminate.  The gamestate's what the 
          reports say, period.  The "Legal State" exists to allow the 
          correction of errors, it exists as a model of what the 
          gamestate should be.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: When the Recordkeepor is not a Player}

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be
      a Player, and other Rules do not define a procedure for selecting
      a new Recordkeepor, the Speaker shall as soon as possible
      designate a willing player as the new Recordkeepor for that Class 
      of Objects.

      Until a new Recordkeepor is designated, the Speaker shall fulfill
      that responsibility.

{Comment: Part of the old version of the prior rule that no longer
          seemed to fit there.
          v0.2 followed elJefe's suggestion.}


Rule 1579 (Mintors) is repealed.
Rule 1722 (Minting of Currencies) is repealed.
Rule 1471 (Creation and Destruction of Currencies) is repealed.

{Comment: Mintors and Mint Authority are actually a hindrance to this
          reform, in that they add additional conditions to the legal 
          status of moves, and actually increase the bureaucratic 
          minutiae required to perform some basic actions, like 
          Converting an Object.  It also prevents the Object scheme from 
          addressing our "non-currency" Objects like Blots and Kudos.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Legal Changes to Objects}

     To have effect, whenever the Rules specify a Transfer, a Creation, 
     or Destruction, of an Object, they must also specify a Player who 
     is to send a message to that Object's Recordkeepor to notify em of 
     the change.  The change only happens if the following conditions 
     hold.

       i) The Rules mandate the change.
      ii) The Rules specify a Player to report the change to the 
          Recordkeepor.
     iii) The specified Player reports the change to the Recordkeepor.

     If all these conditions hold, then the change reported by the 
     Player becomes the Legal State of that Object.

{Comment: Note that this specifies the requirements to change the "Legal
          State" of an object. (see: Object Records)  Note that if the 
          above rule invalidates a move, and we discover it much later, 
          there's still no gamestate indeterminance, at worst the 
          Recordkeepor will have to revise eir records to conform the 
          Object Records to the Legal State of the game, but this would
          not invalidate any moves subsequent to the error.}


Rule 1721 (The Chancellor) is amended to read as follows;

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Class of
      Object, its Name and its Recordkeepor. This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

{Comment: MUQ's and Mintors no longer exist.}


Rule 1599 (Failure to Execute Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1598 (Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1596 (Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1732 (Satisfaction of Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1733 (Disputed Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1734 (Vacated Payment Orders) is repealed

{Comment: This repeals the Transfer Order/Payment Order bureaucracy,
          cutting down immensely on the paperwork required for simple
          actions.}

Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Transferring Objects}

     When an Object is Transferred it ceases to be owned by one entity, 
     and simultaneously becomes owned by another entity.

     An Object is Legally Transferred when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Transfer, reports the Transfer, the original
     owner of the Object, and the new owner of the Object, to that
     Object's Recordkeepor.  At this point the transfer is part of the
     Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Actually Transferred when the Recordkeepor for that 
     Object records the change in ownership for that Object.  At this 
     point the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Transfer with a 
     corresponding Actual Transfer.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     Transfers that correspond to no Legal Transfers, e is guilty of the 
     Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as defined in other Rules.

{Comment: The language here mirrors the language in Object Reports.
          Yes, theoretically the Recordkeepor could make all sorts
          of real transfers, but that is a criminalized act.  This,
          IMHO, is how "pragmatic" recordkeeping should be handled,
          W/O a mountain of paperwork.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Creation or Destruction of Objects}

     When an Object is Created it comes into existence owned by a 
     specific entity.  When an Object is Destroyed, some specific entity 
     with at least one of those Objects has one of those Objects cease 
     to exist.

     An Object is Legally Created when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Creation, reports the Creation, and the owner 
     of the Created Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At this 
     point the Creation is part of the Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Legally Destroyed when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Destruction, reports the Destruction, and the 
     owner of the Destroyed Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At 
     this point the Destruction is part of the Legal State of that 
     Object.

     An Object is Actually Created or Destroyed when the Recordkeepor 
     for that Object records the change for that Object.  At this point 
     the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Creation with a 
     corresponding Actual Creation.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Destruction with a 
     corresponding Actual Destruction.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     changes (Creations or Destructions) that correspond to no Legal
     changes, e is guilty of the Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as
     defined in other Rules.

{Comment: See comment above}


Rule 1713 (Debt) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever the Rules require that Objects be Transferred from an 
     entity, or that Objects possessed by an entity are to be 
     Destroyed, and upon the report of this Legal Transfer or Legal 
     Destruction, the entity possesses fewer Objects of the type
     specified then are required to be Transferred or Destroyed, 
     the Recordkeepor of that Object shall do the following before e
     makes the required Actual Transfers or Destructions:

     E shall Create, in the entity's possession, a number of the 
     specified Objects so the entity possesses exactly the amount of the 
     specified Objects required to be Transferred or Destroyed.  E shall 
     then create in that entity's possession an amount of Blots 
     equivalent to the number of Objects created.  (If this value is 
     elsewhere undefined, the equivalent number of Blots shall be the 
     number of Objects created, divided by two, rounded up.)

     The Recordkeepor for the Object in question is charged with 
     reporting these changes to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

{Comment: There is no such thing as Persistent Indebtedness anymore.  If
          you go into debt, you get a Blot for the Objects you're short.
          Blots become a sort of "negative Object."
          v0.3: I am removing the concepts of Equivalence and
          Convertibility from this Proposal, the concepts are severable 
          enough, and the idea behind all this _was_ to simplify 
          things.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Transferable Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Transferable.  A 
     Transferable Object shall be Transferred whenever an owner of such 
     an Object wishes that Object to be Transferred to another entity 
     that is permitted to own that Object.  The owner of that Object 
     shall report this Transfer to the Recordkeepor of that Object.

{Comment: A basic Rule to cover transfers between Players.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Decimal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Decimal.

     Decimal Objects can be handled and referred to in groups of ten.  
     In the case of Decimal Objects, the name of the Class of Objects is 
     always "Deci<name>" where <name> is the name of a group of ten of 
     these Objects. "<name>" and "Deci<name>" must both follow the 
     conventions and restrictions placed upon the names for Classes of 
     Objects by other Rules. A group of ten Deci<name> Objects is known 
     as a <name> MetaObject.

     A group of Decimal Objects can be referred to as a fractional value 
     of their related MetaObject.  (i.e. 17 "Deci Voting Tokens" can be 
     legally referred to as 1.7 "Voting Tokens".)

     This Rule takes precedence over Rules governing Objects in general.

{Comment: Allows a scheme for "fractional" objects w/o having them
          actually divisible.
          v0.3 Revised this as elJeffe and Oerjan(?) suggested, simply
          having decimal Objects being groups of ten Objects.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Personal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Personal.  
     Personal Objects are only permitted to remain in the possession of 
     Players or the Bank.  If a Personal Object is in the possession of 
     a non-Player entity, then the Recordkeepor of that Object must 
     immediately transfer that Object to the non-Player Entity's
     Executor, or (if it has no Executor) to the Bank.

     The Recorkeepor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     changes.

{Comment: There are a number of Objects that we want to restrict to 
          Players. Blots and Kudos being two that come to mind right 
          now.  If we ever re-introduce something like Win Tokens, they 
          should be Personal as well. Note, this is not an automagical
          process, a Blot could exist in a Group "treasury," but it
          would be illegal for the Herald to let it stay there. And any 
          transfer of it wouldn't be retroactive, but only as of the 
          moment the Herald decided to move it.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Objects Changed by Proposal}

     If a Proposal directly orders changes to any Objects, and does not 
     itself specify a Player to report those changes to the 
     Recordkeepors of those Objects, then the Assessor shall report 
     those changes.

{Comment: Prevents a potential conflict with some prior Rules.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Reporting Object Changes, Timing}

     Whenever the Rules require a Player to report a change in an Object 
     to that Object's Recordkeepor, that Player shall make eir Report of 
     the change as soon as possible after the Rules require em to do so.

     Whenever a Recordkeepor of an Object receives a report in the 
     change of an Object, and that report caused a change in the Legal 
     State of that Object, e must then make the corresponding change in 
     the Actual State of that Object as soon as possible after receiving 
     the report.

{Comment: Fine point here, a change can be a Legal Change if never
          received by the Recordkeepor, but if so, e's not bound by the
          ASAP clause to make the Actual Change until a COE or CFJ finds
          the omission.  And then the change only happens when the
          Recordkeepor decides to make it.}

==============================================================
Part II: Probate


Rule 1601 (Probate) is amended to read as follows;

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any Objects;
      if an entity which possesses any Objects would otherwise be
      destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate, and its
      destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate."

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses any Objects.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.


Rule 1637 (Wills) is amended to read as follows;

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity with which it is
      associated, and how the Transferable Objects possessed by that
      entity and its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs
      when that entity becomes a terminal estate in Probate.

      When a entity's Will is executed, the Executor in Probate of that
      entity will, as soon as possible, report all Transfers required by
      the Will to the appropriate Recordkeepors, excepting those
      Transfers which specify Objects that the entity does not possess.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.


Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
     Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
     that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
     appointment in the Public Forum.

     The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
     entity, and empowered only to report Transfers of Objects
     possessed by that entity.  This takes precedence over Rules that
     provide broader authority for an Executor.
      
     The Executor in Probate must do the following upon eir nomination, 
     in the order given, and perform no other acts on behalf of the 
     terminal estate e represents.  E must not initiate a step until the 
     prior one is complete:

       i) The Executor in Probate must first report to the Herald the 
          destruction of all Blots possessed by the terminal estate e 
          represents. E must do so as soon as possible.  This step shall 
          be complete only when all Blots possessed by the terminal
          estate are Actually Destroyed by the Herald or, if the 
          terminal estate possesses no Blots, this step shall be
          completed immediately.

      ii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report all Transfers of Transferable Objects possessed by
          the terminal estate as required by that entity's Will--
          excepting any impossible Transfers, or Transfers of Objects
          the Terminal Estate does not possess-- This step shall be
          complete only when all Transfers required by this step are
          Actually made by the appropriate Recordkeepors, or, 
          if no such Transfers are Required, or no Will exists, this 
          step shall be completed immediately.

     iii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report the Transfer of all remaining Objects (if any) in 
          that entity's possession to the Bank. This step shall be 
          complete only when all such Transfers are Actually made by the 
          appropriate Recordkeepors, or, if no Objects remain in the 
          possession of the terminal estate, this step shall be 
          completed immediately.

      iv) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must announce, in the Public Forum, that the terminal estate
          has left Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the above steps,
      that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e announces that
      e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

{Comments: This streamlines the whole Probate process, eliminating the
           overhead created by allowing debt in such a small economy.
           v0.2 avoided elJefe's infinite loop.}


Rule 1739 (The Probate Code) is repealed

{Comment: Without TOs or POs, there's no Debt as such, and no such thing
          as a creditor or a debtor.  Therefore, most of this Rule's 
          function is subsumed by the above Rule.}

============================================================
Part III: The Bank


Rule 1470 (The Bank) is amended to read as follows;

     There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank is
     permitted to possess any Object.  This Rule takes prcidence over 
     any Rule that would forbid the Bank from owning an object.

{Comment: No such thing as mint authority.}


Rule 1735 (The Chancellor as Bank's Executor) is repealed.

{Comment: having the Chancellor as an interface between the Officers and
     the bank IMHO is a needless level of complication.  Better to give 
     the individual Recordkeepors the power to manipulate Objects.


Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") is amended to
read as follows;

     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity receives or 
     gains some number of Objects, that Player shall report, to the
     appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of those Objects from the
     Bank to that entity for the number specified.
     
     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity loses or 
     is penalized some number of Objects, that Player shall report to 
     the appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of Objects from that 
     entity to the Bank for the number specified.

{Comment: v0.2 followed some language suggestions.}


===========================================================
Part IV: (ex-)Currencies

Rule 1701 (Proposal Notes) is amended to read as follows;

     There is are MetaObjects known as "Proposal Notes" (P-Notes) and
     a Class of Objects known as "Deci Proposal Notes."  Their
     Recordkeepor is the Promotor.  The Promotor has the duty to 
     publish, at least once a week in the Public Forum, a report of the 
     number of P-Notes owned by each entity that possesses P-Notes, and 
     a list of all the changes in P-Note holdings since the last such 
     report with the reason for those changes.

     The Class of "Deci Proposal Notes" is Decimal and Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 Redid the Rule to conform to the changes I made in
          Decimal Objects' definitional Rule.}


Rule 1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals) is amended to read as follows;

      All Proposals have associated with them a Petition fee.  The
      Petition fee for any Proposal is one P-Note, unless another Rule
      specifies a higher fee.  This rule takes precedence over any
      Rule that would require a lower fee, no fee, or a fee paid in
      Objects other than P-Notes.

      The Petition Fee for a Proposal is paid when an entity
      Transfers the amount of that Proposal's Petition Fee, provided
      that e indicates clearly that the Transfer is being made to pay 
      the Petition fee for that Proposal and e makes no other claim
      as to the purpouse of the Transfer.


Rule 1696 (Voting Tokens) is amended to read as follows;

      There are MetaObjects known as "Voting Tokens" (VTs) and a
      a Class of Objects known as "Deci Voting Tokens".  The
      Recordkeepor for VTs is the Assessor.

      The Assessor's Report includes the number of VTs possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Assessor's Report.

      The Class of "Deci Voting Tokens" is Decimal and Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 see comments re: P-Notes above.}


Rule 1442 (Using VTs) is amended to read as follows;

     The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the Transfer
     of VTs to the Bank, as specified below.

     A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
     Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
     Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

     At the end of the Voting Period, the Assessor shall Transfer enough 
     Voting Tokens from the Voting Entity to pay for the last Vote (or 
     set of Votes) cast by that entity during the Voting Period.

     The Assessor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     Transfers.


Rule 1662 (The Speaker's Gratuity) is amended to read as follows;

      At the end of every month, if the same Player was Speaker for
      that entire month, the Registrar shall pay out a Speaker's
      Gratuity of one Indulgence to the Speaker.

{Comment: Decided that Indulgences are a more interesting reward.}


Rule 1465 (Champion's Reward) is amended to read as follows;

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player.  At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward,
      the Assessor shall pay out one Indulgence, two P-Notes, and five
      Voting Tokens to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has
      not yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on
      any Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion.  This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

{Comment: Redid the award to be more varied.}

===========================================================
Part V: Blots & Indulgences


Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate) is
amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects named Indulgences, which is 
     Transferable. There is a Class of Objects named Blots, which 
     is Personal and not Transferable.  The Recordkeepor for both Blots 
     and Indulgences is the Herald.

     A Player who owns no Blots is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing 
     condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

{Comment: The language fell out neatly given the prior Rules, and 
          finally, after having its status reduced to first a negative 
          value of a "real" currency, then to a Payment Order, a Blot 
          regains its status as an entity in its own right.;) }

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Erasing Blots)

     Any Player who has Blots can erase as many Blots as e has 
     Indulgences.  This occurs only in the following manner:

       i) The Player notifies the Herald that e is erasing a number of 
          Blots.
      ii) If that number is equal to or less than the number of 
          Indulgences possessed by the Player, this notification becomes 
          the report to the Herald of the Legal Destruction of that 
          Number of both Blots and Indulgences possessed by that Player.

{Comment: v0.3 This is a new Rule, because I eliminated Convertibility.}


Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) is amended to read as follows;

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, among all
      Players, randomly distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the 
      number of Blots Actually Created in the past Week : for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and Create
      an Indulgence in the posession of that Player.  The Herald is
      charged with detecting and reporting these changes.

{Comment: Added "Actually" so that there's no ambiguity.  (Actual Blots
          are the ones in the report, which doesn't change, ever, after
          it's made.)}


Rule 1437 (Fugitives from Justice) is amended to read as follows;

     When an Executor in Probate reports the Legal Destruction of Blots 
     belonging to the terminal estate of a deregistered Player, the 
     Herald shall assign the person who was that player a value of 
     Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots the Herald Destroyed.  
     That person becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  Herald shall keep a 
     record of the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive 
     from Justice.

     At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
     value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
     rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
     number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
     one by this method.

     When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
     Create in eir possession a number of Blots equal in number to
     the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
     reregistration.  Players shall not have Fugitive Blots.

{Comment: Changed a few things to make clear that Fugitive Blots aren't
          an Object, nor do Players possess them.}

PROPOSAL: The Internomic Encouragement Act

Let the following rule be created:
(Title: Awards for InterNomic Proposals)

     A Player who submits an InterNomic Proposal shall receive the 
     following awards based upon the results of that InterNomic 
     Proposal.  The Ambassador shall pay out these awards as soon as 
     possible after e announces the results of the InterNomic Proposal.

       i) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, and Agora did 
          not vote FOR it, there is no award.
      ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora did 
          vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
     iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award 
          shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

     In addition, if the adoption of the InterNomic Proposal directly 
     results in Agora receiving enough InterNomic points to win a game 
     of InterNomic, the Player who submitted that InterNomic Proposal 
     shall Win the Game (of Agora).

{Comment: Some encoragement for submitting IN Proposals, and a reward
          for having Agora win.}

I submit the following Internomic Proposal:

Let the following rule be created:

     Any nomic that objects to the actions of a player in Internomic may 
     make a formal protest by sending a message to the moderator 
     detailing the objectionable act the nomic is protesting.  The 
     moderator must then make the protest known to all players of 
     Internomic.  Voting players of Internomic may second the protest by 
     sending a message to the moderator stating that they agree the act 
     is objectionable.  If, within five days of the protest being made 
     known, at least one voting player of Internomic (other than the 
     nomic making the formal protest) seconds the formal protest, the 
     moderator shall call a vote on sanctions.  No formal protests shall
     be permitted while a vote on shanctions is taking place.

     Immediatly after the moderator calls for a vote on sanctions, the 
     moderator shall collect votes form all voting members for a period 
     of two weeks.  Immediately after this period, e shall make known 
     the results, which shall be as follows;

       i) If 25% or less of voting members voted FOR sanctions;
          If the protesting nomic is a player, it shall lose 10 points.
          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of two months after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 5 points.

      ii) If more than 25% and less than 50% of voting members voted FOR
          sanctions;
          If the protesting nomic is a player, it shall lose 7 points.
          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of one month after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 3 points.

     iii) If 50% or more of the voting members voted FOR sanctions;
          The player being protested shall lose 10 points.
          The player being protested shall lose an additional 10 points 
          if all other voting members voted FOR sanctions.

Rule 833/9 requires that:

      If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same
      entity and the Proposal passes, the Assessor shall pay out 2
      P-Notes to the Proposer.  If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
      Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
      shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note.  This is in addition to any
      other payments required by this or other Rules.

Nothing in this Rule states that this does not apply to Disinterested
Proposals.  I believe that, since a Disinterested Proposal has no
Sponsor, it is obviously true that the Sponsor and the Proposal of
that Proposal are not the same, since an undefined entity is not the
same as any defined entity.  

It would seem, therefore, that I have been negligent in reporting a
number of P-Note Payment Orders, for each Proposal made since Rule
833/9 was adopted.  I intend to execute the appropriate Orders on
Monday, unless someone expresses some reason why I should not do so.

I would also like to know if the Wizard ever executed any Payment
Orders for P-Notes, as mandated by Rule 1705.

I'm not sure there are any.  The full effect of Rule 1713, and
Proposal 3568's amendment to it, are not clear to me.  It seems quite
clear to me that, at this moment, the Infraction of Persistent
Indebtedness is undefined by the Rules.

However, the following is a list of the various entities who have had,
at the start of each Nomic Week, one or more outstanding Payment
Orders executed more than seven days prior and, at that time, neither
satisfied nor vacated:

As Assessor, I have previously reported Infractions of Persistent
Indebtedness for Blob in Week 216, General Chaos and Swann in Week
217, and Harlequin in Weeks 220, 221, and 222.  If I reported any
other Infractions, I can't find any record of having reported them.
