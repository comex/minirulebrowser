H. Assessor,

I hereby cast one vote for P3813, and declare presence on P3814.

I also cast two votes against P3815 (unless I've already done so and
lost my record of it, but then trying again doesn't do any harm).

Thanks,

Kolja A.

     THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
     VOLUME 44, ISSUE 10
     Thursday edition
     December 10, 1998


PROPOSALS
---------

12/4   Voting on Proposals 3808-3809 has ended.  Proposal 3809 ("Ten Days
         is Too Long") is adopted, changing the Voting Period on Proposals
         from ten days to seven days.  This has a questionable effect on
         the Voting Periods of Proposals 3810-3812, distributed seven days
         and some hours ago.  In CFJ 1110, the Caller's Arguments suggest
         three possibilities:

         1) Seven days after distribution.
            [Timing of a future event may be changed, even to a past time.]
         2) Ten days after distribution.
            [Timing of an event is fixed at distribution, except for e.g.
             a Guillotine Application which explicitly changes it.]
         3) When Proposal 3809 was adopted.
            [Timing of a future event may be changed to a past time, but
             Rule 108 prohibits retroactive alteration of legality of Votes
             cast between then and now.]

       Chuck adds

         4) None.
            [An event does not occur at time X unless, at time X, it is
             defined as occurring at time X.]

12/5   General Chaos Proposes "More Sensible Amendment Numbers".

       Macross Proposes the following text:  "NARF!"  

12/6   General Chaos Proposes "Restore Sanity", "Every Man Is an Island",
         "Unlimited Voting", "Oh, what a tangled web....", "Some
         Housecleaning", and "Down with Playerism!".

       The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1865 (A Duty to
         Propose).

12/7   General Chaos Proposes "Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive".

       Andre Proposes "Amendment Applications".

12/8   These Proposals are distributed:
         3813 [Crito]         Simplify Currency Handling
         3814 [General Chaos] Currencies
         3815 [Morendil]      Ruleset Lite


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT

OFFICES

         successor) and Justiciar (appointing Crito as successor).

       Andre consents to succeed Michael as Registrar.

I Vote as follows:

3813 FOR
3814 ABSTAIN
3815 AGAINST


For reference, I oppose the repeal of the following Rules:

1750 (Read the Ruleset Week)
1789 (Cantus Cygneus)
1664 (Rebellion)
1840 (Inciting to Riot)
1834 (Robespierre)
1643 (Statements of Policy)
1729 (Insanity)
 908 (Formal Apologies)
1832 (Failure to Apologize)
 651 (Heroes)
 840 (The Scamster)
1047 (Patent Title of Zeitgeist)
1630 (Impersonation)

Also, Rule 1792 (Proposal Applications) has already been repealed, and Rule
1786's correct title begins with "Proposal" rather than "Proposals".
