I've been thinking about Vlad's remark that it's pretty hard to
remember all the precedent that's been set by past CFJs. I have
an idea, which, while it won't completely solve that problem, may
make it less severe. Basically, I'd like to broaden, slightly, the
power of Judges to Annotate the Ruleset.

Consider CFJ 942. In that CFJ, I sought to have R789 Annotated
with the Statement. This can only happen if a Judge judges TRUE.
As it happens, the CFJ turned out to be FALSE - but this is no
less informative in this case than a TRUE Judgement would have
been. The judgement that the definitions of 'CFJ' offered by
Rules 789 and 991 are in conflict and that R991 takes precedence
would be a useful Annotation to make to one or both Rules.

So, how about this:

####
Proto-Proposal
Liberalize Annotations, Slightly

Be it hereby resolved that R789 be amended by replacing the text
in which currently reads:

      If the Judge finds this CFJ's Statement TRUE, e is permitted to
      issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate the
      Rule in question with that Statement and the list of relevant
      Rules.  This annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

with text which reads:

      The Judge of such a CFJ is permitted to issue an Injunction
      requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule in question with
      that Statement, an indication of whether it was Judged TRUE or
      FALSE, and the list of relevant Rules. This annotation, while
      it exists, shall guide application of that Rule.

I appeal the judgement on CFJ 933.

>From the judgement:
>>
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
                                                         ^^^^^^^
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)
<<

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

OFF:  New Proposals

I don't really feel that it is proper for me to refrain from distributing these
proposals sent to me last week.  I hope my CFJ will be judged TRUE, so that
they will get at least an abbreviated Voting Period.

There are three new proposals distributed as of this report.

Note that Andre has specified in eir submission that eir proposals are
to have a Voting Period of 10 days, starting as of this message.  This Promotor
finds it doubtful whether this specification has any legal
significance.

   3552 Steve    1 A Public Voting Experiment
D  3553 Andre    1 Don't discourage Proposing
D  3554 Andre    1 New Player Judgement Leniency

======================================================================

Proposal 3552 (Steve)  AI = 1
A Public Voting Experiment

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

======================================================================

Proposal 3553 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Don't discourage Proposing

Let Rule 1065 (Discourages Too Many Proposals) be repealed.
======================================================================

Proposal 3554 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
New Player Judgement Leniency

Let Rule 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible To Judge a CFJ) be amended
by adding after the phrase 'shall bill that Player a fee of 0.5 VT'
the text ', unless that Player is subject to a Grace Period.

The Herald is reminded that the distribution Rule clearly specifies one PO
per Indulgence, not one per Player. This is a COE.

I hereby create a Transfer Order for 1 Indulgence from myself to the Bank,
for the sole purpose of satisfying POI097.

Which leaves me with POI041 for 3 Indulgences.  I see that delayed TOI021
will pay this off whenever I acquire 3 Indulgences.  I thus revise my
offer to potential Indulgence lenders as follows:

* I will pay back the 3 Indulgences as soon as I am able to do so
* I will pay 0.5 VT per NW till the Indulgences are paid back

Proto:  Fix the Blot Scam

Amend Rule 1732 by replacing "purpose" with "sole purpose".

[This is IMO a cleaner way of doing it than appending a whole new sentence.]

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

BUS: COE: Re: OFF: Herald's Report as of 22 September 1997


The following is a repeat of a message that should have been sent to the PF. 
The payment Orders contained here are meant only to be descriptive and do not
represent new Payment Orders, unless the ones sent to discussion in the
original mesage were ineffective.

====

First I also note that the current set of POs in the Heralds Report of Sept 22
are misnumbered, in that there are two POI105's.  This is a COE.  I hereby
admit this claim.  The relevant part of the message should have read:
