I hereby call for judgement on the following statement, barring lee,
proglet and Murphy:

>>
The requirement to "execute a Payment Order for 0 VTs" can be
fulfilled by doing nothing. 
<<

R&A: The POs that are defined and referred to in the rules are, by
definition, POs for positive multiples of a currency's MUQ (R1596). 

Therefore, a "PO for 0 VTs" is an object not defined by the rules, and
so is the action of executing one. 

Therefore the player who is required to "execute the PO" may choose
what that means with the freedom of R116, and can just ignore the
requirement.

In addition to this argument, there is also game custom to support
this statement: R1442 requires the Assessor to bill _all_ voting
entities "a number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast". This
includes entities who didn't vote at all, to be billed for 0 VTs. This
requirement has never been fulfilled in another way than just by being
ignored.

I vote for myself as Notary.

Just to explain: I'm running for Notary because I want a serious
office to replace the soon-to-be futile Ambassadorship. And I'm not
sure about Murphy's situation at the moment, whether e just has email
problems on the technical level, or whether e doesn't have the time
for the office. I'm not trying to make em look bad or enything, just
saying that I'll be doing the job properly if I get it (as opposed to
my candidacy being a political gesture or feint or something, or a
personal attack on Murphy's quality and past record as Notary).

H. Promotor,

I hereby submit the following proposal:

>>
Monthly salaries


Amend the first paragraph of R1007 to read

      At the beginning of each month, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Player the designated Salary for each Office that
      Player has held for a total of at least 21 days in the 
      preceding month.


Amend R1858 to read

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit
      of half the Basic Officer Salary.


Amend 1854 to read

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before the 25th day of the month, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the month.
