and thereby commits the Infraction of Judicial Inactivity, by going On Hold
while he was Judge of CFJ 1086

In accordance with Rule 1568, he is ordered to pay 0.5 VT to the Bank.

The Rules for replacing him are apparently broken, and he remains Judge
until 9 March, unless he delivers Judgement or is recused in the meantime.
