I, personally, not having been here very long, don't have many reasons to
vote one way or another.  I would like to hear some arguments, either from
the candidates, or from other people.  Sent to the PF, of course ;)

H. Registrar, please note:

I hereby nominate for the office of Ambassador, because Internomic and
the idea of a game that is played by games instead of people was one
of the things that made me want to play Agora, so I'd like to do more
in that direction.
