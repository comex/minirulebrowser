FOR

>    3665 G. Chaos       2 Synonymity

I'll leave this one as it's a minor change which could easily be incorporated into
the Omnibus Reform. Despite Kolja's recent generosity I'm not exactly rolling in
VTs to vote on minor issues.

> D  3666 G. Chaos       1 Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist

I missed the Zombies, sounds like fun :o)

> D  3667 Repeal-O-Matic 3 Repeal Rule 116

Don't like it. I won't vote against it yet (hopefully it won't get quorum).

> D  3668 Kolja A.       1 ROM proposal readability

2 votes FOR. I like the ROM and the (ex) Virus. Random acts help keep a game
interesting.

> D  3669 Kolja A.       1 Blot amnesty

FOR. Let's hope ey can keep eir nose(s) clean now.
