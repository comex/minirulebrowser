PROTO: Order Repair v1.5 (this proposal shall have AI=3)
------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1793 is amended to read as follows;

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity.  It is a non-Rule entity given coercive power by other
      Rules.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
      official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
      official position, and in this case if the Office or position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      Office or position.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

{Comment: The language about either multiple prohibitions, or one single
          act, is needlessly constraining-- and raises some bizzare 
          problems when considering possible amendments.  It makes more 
          sense to treat them as unitary bodies of text with coercive 
          power, like a Rule, that can contain multiple provisions as 
          the situation dictates.  In the case of Orders defined by the 
          Rules, (TO's PO's &c.) there's already reasonable restriction 
          on their content.}


Let the following rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Automatically Invalid Orders)

     An Order shall be invalidated upon its execution if any of the 
     following is true of it;

       i) It seeks to hinder the appeal of itself or some other Order
      ii) It seeks to hinder the stay, vacation or amendment of itself,
          either directly, or indirectly through hindering the stay,
          vacation or amendment of another Order.
     iii) The Order itself is in direct violation of one or more Rules.
      iv) It seeks to compel, or forbid, the performance of any duty
          required or permitted of a Player solely by the virtue of that
          Player being a Judge or Justice.
       v) It seeks to forbid any Player from submitting a CFJ, appealing
          a CFJ, or submitting a Motion.

{Comment: Fixed ii) to allow Orders to hinder the operation of other
          Orders, if that hindering still permits the stay, vacation &c. 
          of the Order in question.}


Let the following Rule be created with a Power=2;
(Title: Precedence and Authority of Orders)

     Orders are non-Rule entities with coercive power granted by this
     Rule.  If there is a conflict between Orders of different classes,
     the following precedence relations shall hold if no other Rule
     explicitly applying to those Orders specifies otherwise. If another
     Rule explicitly states that an Order executed by a particular
     Player in a particular circumstance shall take precedence over--
     or defer to-- another Order, then that method of precedence shall 
     govern first.

     Otherwise, Orders have precedence in relation to their class as 
     follows;

       i) Administrative Orders have precedence over Private Orders.
      ii) Judicial Orders have precedence over Administrative Orders and 
          Private Orders.
     iii) Appellate Orders have precedence over all other Orders.
      iv) Between Orders of the same class, the Order that was most
          recently executed or amended shall take precedence.

     The following shall always apply to any Order, other Rules
     notwithstanding;

     An Order can only affect another Order when the Order affected 
     does not take precedence over it. An Order that attempts to do so 
     is invalidated upon execution.

     No Order can forbid or hinder a Player from executing an Order
     of equal or higher precedence.  An Order that attempts to do so is 
     invalidated upon execution.

     This Rule takes precedence over other Rules defining the precedence 
     of non-Rule Entities that don’t apply solely to Orders.

{Comment: Revised this to allow stays upon appeal, and to treat Orders
          as NREs, with a twist.  In order for vacation and such to be
          effective, I have reversed the "normal" precidence for NREs, 
          with later-executed Orders taking precidence.  I think this 
          makes sense given the nature of Orders, wich are more 
          transitory than Rules or SLCs.
          
          Redid this to allow specific rules to revice precidence
          relations of specific Orders.}


Rule 1809 is amended to read as follows;

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ which Statement alleges that the Order is improper.  (i.e.
      invalid, improperly executed, or for an improper purpose.)

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  This Order to stay shall take precidence over the Order
      in dispute. If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
      Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

{Comment: This is a better solution IMO than my prior attempt.  It 
          allows us to have a precedence of Orders, but allows special 
          cases, like the above, when we would want to grant an order 
          precedence beyond what is normal.  (The Judge doesn’t need a 
          clause, since the only Order eir Order doesn’t take precedence 
          over are Appellate Orders.}


Rule 217 is amended to read;

      All Judgements, and Judical Orders, must be in accordance with the
      Rules; however, if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear 
      on the Statement to be Judged, or the Order to be issued, then the
      Judge shall consider game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, 
      and the best interests of the game before applying other 
      standards.

{Comment: This gives the same standards to Judicial Orders that apply to
          Judgements.}


Rule 1804 is amended to read;

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.

      The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
      improper (i.e. invalid, improperly executed, or for an improper 
      purpose), amend or vacate the Order, as it deems appropriate.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  This Order to stay shall take
      precidence over the Order under appeal. If the Board of Appeals 
      affirms the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate 
      this stay.

{Comment: See the amendment of 1809.  BTW, both of these use the
          new definition of improper I introduced.}


Rule 1827 is amended to read;

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

      In any case, the Judge shall deny any Motion that would require
      eim to make an improper Order, is not directly relevant to the 
      CFJ to which it applies, or would require em to act in violation
      of any Rule.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
      Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
      perform as requested by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      the determination made and the reasons, if any, on the record of
      the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the Motion of that
      determination.

{Comment: Currently it is perfectly all right for a Motion to be issued
          that directly bribes a judge to grant itself (I was 
          considering, as an alternative response to the Counter-
          Revolution, submitting a motion requesting a Judge-- notably 
          P-Note poor-- to pay out to emself five P-Notes and vacate all 
          of Macross’ Orders), and it currently need not have anything 
          to do with the CFJ in question.}

Rule 1830 is repealed

{Comment:  The first part is taken over by the stronger Rule above, and 
           the other clase can be added to the dismissal Rule.}

Rule 1565 is amended by changing the text;

      “ i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.”

To read as follows;


      “ i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.
      vii) Its statement alleges that a Judge or Justice has failed to
           perform a duty of a judicial nature.


Rule 1806 is amended to read;

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
      accompanied by that false certification. This Order to vacate
      shall take precidence over the falsly certified Order.


Rule 1807 is amended to read;

      Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
      valid if and only if addressed to:
        i) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
       ii) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
      iii) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
       iv) any combination of the above.

      All other Appellate Orders are improper and presumptively invalid.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.


Rule 1695 is amended to read as follows;

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was proper, valid, and if it
      was appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made proper, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was improper, invalid, or that
      it was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.


Rule 1796 is amended to read as follows;

      All Administrative, Judicial, and Appellate Orders executed in the
      manner prescribed by the Rules are presumed valid and enforceable 
      until proven otherwise by CFJ.

      Any Private Order that is of a type not explicitly permitted by
      the Rules, or is not pursuant to an agreement between the Player
      issuing it and the entity to which the Order is directed, or is
      not affecting such an Order, is presumptively invalid until proven 
      otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must;

        i) Permit the Player who executed the Order in question to 
           execute such an Order.

       ii) Require or permit the execution of the Order in the 
           circumstances which existed at the time it was executed.

      iii) Not explicitly render it invalid.

{Comment: Loosened the reigns on private Orders to allow for Player
          agreements, removed the "class and type" language.}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Definition of Improper for Orders)

     An Order shall be improperly executed when it fails to conform to 
     the procedures defined in the Rules for the execution of an Order, 
     or if its content fails to conform to the strictures provided in 
     the Rules for the content of an Order.

     An Order shall be for an improper purpose if it does not conform to 
     the purpose of such an Order as broadly defined in the Rules.  The 
     following shall be the minimum considerations for determining the 
     proper purpose for each class of Order;

       i) Private Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to the personal business of the Player 
          issuing them, or to the business of entities over which that 
          player has legal control when the Order was issued.
      ii) Administrative Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless 
          they are directly relevant to the performance of the official 
          duties of the Player issuing them.
     iii) Judicial Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to a CFJ being Judged by the Player 
          issuing them.
      iv) Appellate Orders shall not be for a proper purpose unless they 
          are directly relevant to an issue that Board is currently 
          adjudicating.

     Orders which are improperly executed, or for an improper purpose, 
     are invalid.

     Orders that are improperly executed, for an improper purpose, or
     are otherwise invalid, are defined as improper Orders.


Rule 1800 is amended by appending the following paragraph;

     "If an Amendment to a valid Order would render it invalid, then the 
      Order to make that Amendment is itself invalid.

I apologize for my neglect of my Rulekeeping duties the past
few weeks--I was busier than I expected the past few weeks
finishing up classes.  If I had realized how busy I was going
to be, I would have delegated the Office.  But now I have my Master's degree,
and I'm currently out of school and unemployed, so I should
have plenty of time for Agora. :)

I have deleted the empty Rule Category, "The Agoraverse."
I have created a new Rule Category, "Plots," into which I
have placed Rules 1843-1851.

I order the Bank to pay 3 P-Notes to each of the following
entities, as per R947:
The Repeal-O-Matic (for P3740)
Murphy (for P3741)

The following Players each gain 3 Points for having Rule-Changing
Proposals adopted in the indicated Nomic Weeks, as per R1784:
Blob, Swann (week of April 27)
Murphy, Harlequin (week of May 4)
Blob (week of May 11)
Steve (week of May 18)
