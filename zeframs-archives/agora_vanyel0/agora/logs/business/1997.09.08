H. CotC,

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

---

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

---

Arguments :

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

Ouch!  I think we have established that it is legal for a penalty of 3 Blots to
be assessed with one Payment Order for 3 Indulgences, rather than three
separate Payment Orders of 1 Indulgence.  R1435 is pretty clear on this. 
Please do so in the future.  What with all the zombies roaming around Agora, I
have enough POs to keep track of as it is.  8)

Actually, several Claim of Errors will be found here.

Vir is not listed as being eligible to judge CFJ 938.  Vlad defaulted on
CFJ 938 on Sept 5.  Vir registered on Sept 4.  Vir is eligible to judge
this CFJ.

Vir is listed as judge of CFJ 938, but (according to this message) is not
eligible to judge it.

Vir is listed as judge of CFJ 938, but the history shows that this CFJ was
assigned to Steve.

Wrong, all of Blob's Blots were disputed at that time - this is a
COE. (Your message is time-stamped 10PM Sun. 7, TZ -0400, unless
some element of the timestamp got mangled that is after Sun. 8 GMT

Shoot!  Forgot about the damn time zone difference.  Claim ADMITTED.
POI053 is hereby vacated.  Elde should be listed as having 29 Blots, not 30.

In fact, as I read R1435, it is not legal to do it in separate POs at all,
so the above Report was wrong. This is a COE.
