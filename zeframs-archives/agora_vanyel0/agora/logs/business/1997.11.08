H. Promotor Crito--

I hereby submit the following Proposal.

If I have a P-note, I pay one P-note for its Interestedness.


================================================================
Proposal
Clarify probate for Groups

Amend Rule 1637 (Wills) to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

{ Comments: Avoids the phrase "associated with" which also occurs in the
definition of Organizations; replaces it with "belongs to" which fits well
with the concept of it being the "Entity's" will.  Appends a clarifying
sentence to make sure.  Fixes a typo in the original Rule. }

I find that when Antimatter deregistered on 10 September he had no
currencies of any kind (noone did).  Thus he was never placed in Probate by
Rule 1601.  Unless the Rules authorize the Notary to place people into
Probate arbitrarily, or to appoint an EiP for entities not in Probate
(which I doubt), I find that the Notary's attempted appointment of
Harlequin as EiP had no effect.

Thus Harlequin is not an Executor in Probate for Antimatter.

I do note that Morendil _did_ possess currencies when he was deregistered,
and so Harlequin's appointment as EiP for Morendil (on 27 October) was
effective.

Though the actions required of the EiP are straightforward, I find that
Rule 1738 requires "timely" action rather than "as soon as possible".  It
would be unreasonable to hold that 8 days of inaction was a violation.
Thus Harlequin did not violate Rule 1738 here either.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Judge

Decision of the Justiciar:  Overturn and judge FALSE

CFJ 933 established that all units of currency had disappeared on 15 July,
and no new ones were minted before October.  Thus I find that when Blob
deregistered on 6 August, e possessed no units of any currency.

Thus Blob was not placed into Probate by Rule 1601.  Unless the Rules
authorize the Notary to place people into Probate arbitrarily, or to
appoint an EiP for entities not in Probate (which I doubt), I find that
Blob was never in Probate

Further, when Elde was deregistered on 25 July he also had no Currencies
and thus was never in Probate, and so Morendil could not be his EiP.  Thus
Morendil's attempt to reregister him had no effect.  When the Notary
attempted to appoint an EiP for Blob, Elde was not a Player.

For both (or either) of these reasons, the Notary's attempted appointment
of Elde as Blob's EiP had no effect.

Thus Elde was never an Executor in Probate for Blob.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

I Call for the Appeals of CFJ 1068 and CFJ 1053.

In both cases, Judge elJefe made a serious misreading of Rule 1601: He
took the first paragraph's requirement that certain entities that would be
destroyed shall instead be placed in Probate, and without sufficient
reason he interpreted this as the definition of Probate; while at the same
time he ignored its last paragraph, which places deregistered Players in
Probate regardless of whether they own Currency or not. Thus his argument
falls apart.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Investigating the effects of Elde's non-Probate status, I've noticed
that two CFJs were, in fact, Judged by Elde.  Those CFJs are therefore
improperly recorded as Judged.  They are CFJs 934 and 933.  Both CFJs
are therefore in need of Judging.

Andre was not elected Clerk of the Courts in September.  Andre was
reported as winning 9-7, but two of those votes were cast by Elde and
Blob, neither of whom was actually a Player at that time.  Hence,
there is yet no winner in that Election.  

I'm not sure whether this means that I get to choose who won that
Election, as the Speaker then, whether Morendil gets to do so (as the
Speaker now), or if the Election is mooted entirely.
