Permanent Electioneering

[Comment: I think the temporary ban on Electioneering has been a success,
and I'd like to see it made permanent. Permitting the Assessor to use the
information in eir possession as a resource gives the Office much more
interest and scope for creative play.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 and 1652 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
A Duty to Vote

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1630 (Impersonation)

Rule 1630 is hereby Repealed.

Promotor's Report of P-Note holdings as of 19 August 1998

Recent events:
--------------

Date: Wed, 12 Aug 1998 22:03:24 +1000

    Assessor Steve issues P-Note awards for P3779 and P3780.

Date: Mon, 17 Aug 1998 10:02:09 +1000 (EST)

    Steve attempts to pay 1 P-Note to increase Priority of 
    "A Duty to Vote", but the transfer fails to to lack of funds.

    (Due to the conditional phrasing of the message, no Transfer
     Order is recorded.)

New Proposals: 3785 - 3786

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report.  The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Wednesday,
August 29.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
S = Sane
E = Emergency
I = Insane
U = Urgent

   3785 Steve          1 Permanent Electioneering
   3786 Steve          1 A Duty to Vote

======================================================================

Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Permanent Electioneering

[Comment: I think the temporary ban on Electioneering has been a success,
and I'd like to see it made permanent. Permitting the Assessor to use the
information in eir possession as a resource gives the Office much more
interest and scope for creative play.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 and 1652 be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
A Duty to Vote

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

H. CotC Michael,

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

Statement:

      In the case of conflict between Rules of unequal Power, the higher
      Powered Rule cannot defer to the lower Powered Rule, unless the
      higher Powered Rule takes precedence over Rule 1482.

Argument:

This follows directly from the wording of R1482, which states that:

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

Motion to Annotate:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of this CFJ requesting that e
Order the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1482 with a copy of the Statement.

lee, you haven't agreed to be Blob's successor in the PF yet.  In the
meantime, Blob though retired from the Office, so not its Electee,
still holds it.

Of course, there will be an Election to fill the job, because the
Office doesn't have an Electee. 

I hereby Call for Nominations for the Office of Accountor. 

Registrar Michael.

H. Cotc Michael,

I hereby Call for Judgement on the Statement below. I bar Michael.

Statement:

      The presence in a Rule of deference clause, claiming that the Rule
      defers to another Rule, does not prevent a conflict with the other
      Rule arising, but shows only how the Rule says that conflict is to
      be resolved when it does arise.

Argument:

The Statement follows from two assumptions, both of which it would be
extremely difficult to reject.

1. The Mirror Image Assumption

Precedence and deference are converse relations, logical mirror images
of each other. This simply means that if A claims to take precedence
over B, then this is logically equivalent to B's claiming to defer to A.

2. The Conflict Assumption

When A claims to take precedence over B, this does not prevent a
conflict between A and B arising. Rather we say that the conflict
exists, but is resolved in favour of A (other things being equal).

By the Conflict Assumption, precedence claims do not make conflicts
disappear, they just show how to resolve them when they arise. But
by the Mirror Image Assumption, the situation in which A claims to take
precedence over B is equivalent to one in which B claims to defer to A.
So this situation too must be one in which the conflict is not made to
disappear. This what the Statement claims.

Motion:

I hereby file a Motion with the Judge of the CFJ requesting that e Order
the Rulekeepor to Annotate Rule 1030 with a copy of the Statement.
