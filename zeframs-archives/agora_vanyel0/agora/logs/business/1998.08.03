H. Accountor,

I hereby transfer 1.8 VTs from myself to the Prder of the Evil Eye.

If I haven't already done so, I also transfer 1 VT from myself to the
bank in order to satisfy VT2593.

Thanks, 

Kolja A.

I Apologize for taking offense where none was meant in my reaction to
previous reactions to my judgment of CFJ 1100. By way of explanation,
for that is what apology meant at one time, let me say this:

I have given this CFJ much thought during a week that was very hectic
for me in RL.  I was in New York City for a business trip for much of
this week, and my access to the internet was limited by the poor
quality of the phone system in my hotel.  I changed mail account
because I discovered AOL had destroyed or lost some of my email for
some mysterious reason.  That is why I asked who was CotC, I could not
find the report that said e was CotC, or all my mail to see if it might
have changed.  I finally was able to access the internet long enough to
access Vanyel's archives to get information from May, including CFJ's
that some thought i did not consider.  Also, NYC puts me on edge.  I
worked very hard to make a well reasoned judgment.  I have no desire to
be a half hearted Player, or to drop out so soon after starting again.  

I also want to thank once more all of those who sent me evidence and
helped me by answering questions.

Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
The Voting Tariff

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. But Votes are still valuable, because of the danger that
 prices will go up.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 2

This Week with R-O-M

I show 352 Rules.  The selection are:

  6 = Rule  754 Spelling and Grammar Errors
 75 = Rule  404 Legality of Proposals
291 = Rule 1777 Winning Scores
200 = Rule 1505 Standard Classes of Crimes
 16 = Rule 1079 Definition of "Random"

I choose Rule 404, maybe there are some "contents" Players *want* to prevent
from being legal proposals.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following Prposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 404 (Legality of Proposals)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 2

Rule 404 is hereby Repealed.

Well, seeing as I'm in a good move and as I have considerable assets at the
moment, I'll Vote FOR P3780.  I'm not a great fan of Secret Voting but your
recently posted data was interesting and I'm curious to see what will
happen.

I disagree, and intend to count Macross' both as having voted, and
as having committed the Infraction of Public Voting.

In fact, I hereby report Macross for having committed the Infraction
of Public Voting, and order him to pay 1 Blot and 1 Voting Token to the
Bank as a penalty. Herald Crito and Accountor Blob, please note.
