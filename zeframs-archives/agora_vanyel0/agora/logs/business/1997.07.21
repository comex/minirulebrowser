Shoot!  I was so intent on fixing it to account for PC, I forgot about Wizard
Office changes. So,

H. Assessor take note, I hereby disown proposal 3541.  If it is legal for me to
do so, I hereby pay the 1 P-Note required for disowning a proposal at this
time.

A revised version of this proposal will follow shortly.

Well, I don't want Style Points to be a source of regular income of P-Notes and
I'd prefer that Players not be rewarded simply for regaining Style Points that
have been lost.  If you can think of a better way to accomplish this, I'm open
to suggestions.  Or do you think the P-Note reward should be eliminated?  (I
*do* wish people would bring up these kinds of objections when a proposal is
proto'd, rather than after they are distributed.)

PROTO-Proposal: Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies :)
 
Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Change Rule 1712's title ("Distribution of Indulgences") to "Indulgences
are a Closed System" and amend it to read:

      Whenever a Blot is created, one Indulgence is created in the Bank,
      unless the Bank has Anti-Indulgences greater than 1, as described
      elsewhere in this Rule.

      Whenever an Entity transfers an Indulgence to the Bank in order
      to satisfy a Blot, one Indulgence in the Bank is destroyed.

      If the number of Indulgences in existence is ever less than the 
      number of Blots minus one, enough Indulgences are created in the 
      Bank so that the number of Indulgences is equal to the number of 
      Blots minus one.

      The Bank has a property known as "Anti-Indulgences." This
      Property is an index. If the number of Indulgences in existence
      is ever greater than the number of Blots minus one, this index
      is increased by one for each Indulgence that exists beyond
      the number of Blots minus one. Whenever a Blot is created and
      the Bank's Anti-Indulgences is greater than 1, the Bank's
      Anti-Indulgences is increased by 1.
      
      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, for each
      Indulgence in the Bank, pay out one Indulgence to a randomly
      selected Active Player.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Indulgence holdings of all Players and the Nomic Bank are set to the
following values:

Hope I'm not trodding on anyone's toes here. This is just a draft as to how
to fix the various problems Pragmatic Currencies left in its wake. I
realize that the "Anti-Indulgences" thing is a bit of a kludge, but I can't
think of any way to fix this problem without adding additional entities,
since the definition of "Blot" prevents the Bank from having POs to any
other entity be Blots and the definition of PO prevents the bank from
having a PO from itself, to itself. If anyone can think of a better way to
do this...
