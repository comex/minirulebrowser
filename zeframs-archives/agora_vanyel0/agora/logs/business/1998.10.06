Oy. Big boo-boo. And I just spent a second P-Note raising the Priority
of the Proposal, too. Thanks for picking that up though. I'm glad
somebody's paying attention.

I'm not sure if R1774 is working (I recall that it wasn't at one point,
and I don't know if that ever got fixed), but: 

H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby remove "The P-Note Tap" from the Proposal Queue.

I think this numbering scheme is just slightly less than ideal in two
ways. First, a single letter ('a') is not enough to distinguish at a
glance POs issued by the Assessor from those issued by the Accountor.
Second, you're eventually going to need 4 numerals to count POs.
Therefore, I think you should use 'AsVTnnnn' as your format.

Hip hip hooray!

H. Accountor lee, perhaps you might like to provide an list of who
currently would have a duty to vote, if a Proposal were to be
distributed now (not that that seems very likely...)

How are those VT Reports coming?

H. Accountor lee,

I hereby transfer 3 VTs to the Bank to satisfy the above PO.

>apn003  the Bank       Steve        2  P-Notes   R833, P3792
>apn004  the Bank       Steve        2  P-Notes   R833, P3793

Blob, these POs are incorrect in two ways. The reward in R833 is for
each week in which I get a Proposal passed. It doesn't matter how many
Proposals I get passed in that week, I still only get one reward.
But also, the requirement for you issue the PO does not get triggerred
until the beginning of the week *after* the week in which the Proposal
was adopted. Of course, that may not mean that you aren't permitted to
issue to POs anyway. It may be that so long as nobody challenges them
(and why would they?), they can stand (or at least one of them can).

So, regard this a COE only on apn004.
