BUS: Indulgence Transfer

Harlequin,

Alas, I regret to inform you that this transfer failed due to lack of funds at
the time specified for it to take effect.

Unfortunately for you, you had already issued a delayed TO, TOI023, which was
specified to take effect at the moment funds became available.  This TO was
triggered to take effect as soon as Kolja's transfer succeeded.  Although this
sequence of events occurred prior to your even sending the message below, I
don't think it would have made any difference, since you failed to cancel the
prior delayed TO before Kolja's TO took effect.

Regretfully,
Crito

>>> Chaos Harlequin <harlequin@tmbg.org> 09/20/97 05:17pm >>>
I hereby issue a Delayed Transfer Order, to take effect one second after
Kolja A.'s Delayed Transfer Order of 1 Indulgence from eirself to me
takes effect, for 2 Indulgences, from myself to the Bank.

I hereby state that this Transfer is for the purposes of satisfying

Indulgence from myself to the Bank, for the purpose, among others, of
satisfying the above Payment Order.

The above Transfer Order has as its purpose, among others, to satisfy 
the above Payment Order.

I also claim that the above purported PO is illegal (and thereby
dispute it insofar as it indeed a PO), in that Rule 1596 requires a
Payment Order to specify "exactly one source entity, exactly one
destination entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of
that Currency". The above sentence contains a single command, which
names more than one source entity.

> POI029  08/25/97 14:14:07 -0400     1     Morendil     Bank        Herald

The above Transfer Order has as its purpose, among others, to satisfy
the above Payment Order.

> POI046  09/02/97 10:22:45 -0400     1     Morendil     Bank         Herald

The above Transfer Order has as its purpose, among others, to satisfy
the above Payment Order.

> POI059  09/08/97 11:18:38 -0400     1     Morendil     Bank         Herald

The above Transfer Order has as its purpose, among others, to satisfy
the above Payment Order.

I hereby kindly request of the Herald to note a transfer of as many
Indulgences as I currently possess from myself to Elde, which unless I have 
miscounted should be 3.
