As Contestmaster of the Pass the Parcel Contest I am required to
make the following transfers:

I transfer 0.5 VTs from the Contest to Crito.
I transfer 2 VTs from the Contest to Murphy.
I transfer 0.5 VTs from the Contest to Kolja.
I transfer 2 VTs from the Contest to Harlequin.

Sorry, but I don't have time at the moment to run a second PtP
contest.

These transfers having been made, the Contest is dissolved.

I hereby vacate the Transfer Order I previously made satisfying the PO
which Chuck issued with this number (H. Chancellor, please note), and
transfer 2 VTs to the Bank to satisfy the above PO.

I also vacate the Transfer Order for 1 P-Note I made satisfying the PO
issued by Chuck labelled 'aaa270'. Since I did not buy back Quorum after
all, I'd like this P-Note returned to me.
