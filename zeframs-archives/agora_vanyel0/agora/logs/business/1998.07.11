My RL has gotten weird again so I find I must do the following---
If I am still Scorekeepor, I resign my post in favor of the Speaker.
(I have data up until June 30, when things started swamping me, and I
would ask the current Speaker, whoever e is, to send me a personal note
so I can forward them.)

I also hereby go On Hold.
Hopefully, this time, I'll make it back before I'm deregistered for
inactivity.

Swann
