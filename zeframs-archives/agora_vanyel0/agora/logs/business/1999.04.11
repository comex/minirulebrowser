Proto:  The Spiraling Cost of Voting

Create a new Rule titled "The Voting Factor" with this text:

      The Voting Factor is a real number between 0.1 and 10
      inclusive.  Unless the Rules give it another value, the
      Voting Factor is 1.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Factor by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Factor does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend Rule 1442 (The Cost of Voting) to read:

      Votes on Proposals have a voting cost, based on the Voting
      Tariff and Voting Factor at the time they were distributed.
      If either of these had no value set at that time, then they
      are deemed to have been 1 VT and 1, respectively.

      The voting cost of an entity's first vote on a Proposal is
      equal to the Voting Tariff.  The voting cost of each additional
      vote by that entity on that Proposal is equal to the previous
      vote's cost multiplied by the Voting Factor, then rounded up to
      the nearest multiple of the MUQ of VTs.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the total cost of the votes
      cast on that Proposal by that entity.

Remove "by" from (2) and (3).

>       (b) A Group casts its Votes by its Agent.

I would prefer "A Group's Votes are cast by its Agent on the Group's
behalf".

Replace "Executor in Probate" with "Trustee".

Also, do you have any specific use in mind for the Charter/Bylaws
distinction, other than giving each Organization a convenient pair
of terms (similar to the ancient Immutable/Mutable distinction)?
