The following is an Application to create an Organization of the Class:
Group

Name of Group: ASPCA (Agoran Society for the Promotion of Chaos and
Anarchy)

Ordinancekeepor: Vlad
Vizier: Vlad

Ordinances:

1. The purpose of this Group is to create fear, confusion,
gastrointestinal disorders, and general mayhem in the Nomic known as
Agora.

3. There is no Ordinance 2.

4. The members of this Group shall be the Founders, and anyone else who
wants to join, unless they don't want to be members anymore, in which case
to hell with them.

3.1415926: A new Ordinancekeepor or Vizier shall be chosen whenever
necessary.

17: At the start of each Month, or at other times, the Vizier may invite
all members to concoct a Fiendish Plot for the furtherance of the Group's
aims. Members shall vote which Fiendish Plot is the most original,
dastardly, and likely to lead to Interesting Things Happening. 

17A. The Password is Barcelona.

666: Revealing a Fiendish Plot to a non-member prematurely is grounds for
expulsion from the Group.

Cucumber: The Fiendish Plotter whose Plot gets the most votes shall be
designated the Mad Bomber. All Members shall then follow the directions of
the Mad Bomber as required to execute the Fiendish Plot.

81: Ecnanidro Sdrawkab: Yrassecen revenhew secnanidro eseht egnahc yam
srebmem eht.

Z: Interfering with this Group's activities, particularly by getting all
lawyerish about our ordinances, is also grounds for expulsion. We resolve
problems within the Family, you see. If you have a problem, come to me.

12, 13, 28-33, and 48: Simple enough, eh?

----------------------
I hereby sign the above Application

I believe this should say "CFJ 1064".  This is a COE.

    overlooked in advisory report
  * Proposal 3575's attempted Amendment of 1632 ineffective, due
    to ambiguity (cf. R594).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following is an encoded version of the above orders. The syntax is
"P <payor> -> <payee> (<amount> <currency>) <suggested-order-number>"

This is the syntax the Assessor uses for encoding Payment and Transfer
Orders in eir records; for a transfer replace the P with a T, and the
order number indicates that the transfer is to satisfy that payment
order.
