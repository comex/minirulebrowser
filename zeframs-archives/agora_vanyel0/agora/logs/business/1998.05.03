If it is possible for me to perform both of the actions labelled A) and B)
below, then I do so:

     A) I hereby execute a Payment Order for 50 Indulgences from myself
        to Crito.

     B) I hereby vacate the Payment Order executed in A).

By Rule 1784 (newly amended by Proposal 3733), this gives me 100 more
Points,
and thus my first Win.


Proto-Proposal:  Vacated blots and scores, take two

Amend Rule 1784 by replacing the text "Whenever a Payment order for a
certain
number of indulgences naming a player as payor" with "Whenever a Blot".
