H. Promotor Blob,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, and pay 1 P-Note to the Bank for
the purpose of raising its Priority to 1.

####
Proposal
The P-Note Tap

[Comment: the number of P-Notes in circulation has been slowly but
steadily increasing for some time, and will likely continue to do so.
The idea I have to combat this is basically a new Currency lever, this
one less subtle than that which the Chancellor has controlling VT
supply: this lever simply turns P-Note supply on, or off. When the
P-Note Tap is on, the Bank pays P-Note POs as normal. When the Tap is
off, the Bank stops paying P-Note POs (the Chancellor vacates them
instead of paying them).]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The P-Note Tap", be created
with the following text:

      The P-Note Tap is either on or off. Initially, the Tap is on.
      While the Tap is on, the Bank's executor shall satisfy Payment
      Orders naming the Bank as payor in the normal way, as described in
      other Rules. While the Tap is off, the Bank's executor is not
      required to satisfy any Payment Order naming the Bank as payor,
      nor shall e do so; e is instead required to vacate any such
      unsatisfied Payment Order (including Payment Orders which were
      executed while the Tap was on, but remained unsatisfied when the
      Tap was turned off), either as soon as possible after it is
      executed, or as soon as possible after the Tap is turned off,
      whichever occurred later. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would require the Bank's executor to satisfy Payment Orders
      naming the Bank as payor while the Tap is off.

      The Promotor is the sole Player authorized to turn the P-Note Tap
      on, or off, and e may do either by posting the appropriate notice
      to the Public Forum, provided that at least a week has passed
      since e last turned the Tap on or off.
