Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Sat, 6 September 1997
Date of last Report: Mon, 11 August 1997


Week 1:

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 4 and 9, which read:


      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

I selected sentence  to be deleted.

{Comments:
Again, the first sentence has already had its chance to affect play, 
way back when the FM was an office. We haven't done anything with 
the second yet.
}

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 116, which reads:

####
Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.
####

I selected the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

I selected the noun "Rule."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

Week 2:

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 1 and 3, which read:

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

I selected sentence 3 to be deleted.

{Comments:

Enough of the post-modernist Monster for me, I think.
}

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1635, which reads:

####
Rule 1635/2 (Power=1)
Calling for InterNomic Judgement

      Players are permitted to submit Statements for Judgement to the
      Game of InterNomic. Whenever a Player who has not previously
      submitted such a Statement in the same Nomic Week posts to the
      Ambassador a text clearly labeled as a Statement for Judgement
      in InterNomic, the Ambassador shall be required to submit it, as
      soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance to InterNomic
      procedures.
####

I selected the sentence

      Players are permitted to submit Statements for Judgement to the
      Game of InterNomic. 

I selected the noun "Players."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for 
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic. 

Week 3:

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 2 and 11, which read:

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every
      Frankenstein Monster which exists, detailing for each
      Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of
      that Frankenstein Monster.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

I selected sentence 2 to be deleted.

{Comments:

I'd like to give the new addition more than a few milliseconds in existence, and since Scott 
adamantly denies the existence of any Frankenstein Monsters, the schedule has been empty 
anyway.
}

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 947, which reads:

####
Rule 947/11 (Power=1)
Bonus for Repeal

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.
####

I selected the sentence

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

I selected the noun "Rulekeepor."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Frankenstein Monster shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer 
      of that Proposal.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/40 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for 
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic. 

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Frankenstein Monster shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer 
      of that Proposal.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
