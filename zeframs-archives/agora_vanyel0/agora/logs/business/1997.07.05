Proposal: Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Speaker may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

[v2 Changed the declaration to be Without Objection]

H. Promotor, 

I hereby make the following proposal, and spend 1 P-Note to pay its
Petition Fee.

----

Proposal: Make Rebellion more interesting

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Rebellious Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending
      a message to the Public Forum saying e does so. Abiding Players may
      not Call for Revolt. If more than one Call for Revolt is made
      in a Nomic Week, only the first such Call has effect.

      As soon as possible after the posting of a Call for Revolt, the
      Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds, as outlined
      below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - All Rebellious Players lose all their Blots.
         - All Rebellious Players gain 3 EVs from the Bank

         - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 1 (additional) Blot

      The Registrar is required to report all Currency and Blot transfers
      resulting from this Rule.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.

[v1.0 The aim is to make Rebellion a bit more risky, but also to set 
      penalties so that if a Revolt does take place, you'd rather be
      on the winning side.]
[v1.1 fixed some language, added reporting requirement]
[v2.0 added Blot penalties & Patent Title]
[v2.1 toned down some of the rewards & penalties]
[v2.2 Added some language modifications suggested by Murphy]
[v2.3 Removed "At the time this Rule is created..." sentence]
[v2.4 Fiddled with the penalties again.]
[v3.0 Removed the penalty for Abiding Players, and changed the reward to 3 EVs]
[v3.1 Removed vague language about determining the result of the Revolt]
[v3.2 Changed to reflect new Agoraspace & Indulgences rules.]

I claim this report is in error, in that it does not include
the VTs due to Rule 1727/0 ("Happy Birthday").

Rule 1727/0 was in effect until Jul 1 00:40:36 GMT +1000, which
is equivalent to Jun 30 02:40:36 GMT -1200.  Rule 1727/0 stated
that each player received 3 VTs at Jun 30 00:04:30 GMT -1200.
Thus, this transfer was effective.

Sorry I didn't post earlier, but this just occurred to me.

Chuck
