With plot repair adopted, IIRC there are still some weaknesses, but
I'd still like to go ahead and try to play with plots.

If I understood the rules correctly, I can acquire up to three plots
for free by simply stating (and I hereby do so) that I transfer 0 VTs
from myself to the bank for the sole purpose of buying plots Area 44,
Area 45 and Area 54. According to rule 1843, which states
 
      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by
      transferring the Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the
      sole purpose of buying that Plot.

it seems to me that this immediately makes me the owner of these
plots.

Now let's create some structures. I can do so by informing the
Cartographor (R1848). This office has just been created by the
adoption of P3753, and it seems to me that Blob as the Speaker is
holding this office now. Anyway, whoever it is, e is required to read
the PF, and I hereby inform the Cartographor of the creation of a mine
on Area 44, a farm on Area 45 and another farm on Area 54.

This CFJ is interesting because its judgement will not only depend on
rules interpretations, but also on historical facts, like which
version of Swann's orders was valid at the time in question. I
therefore call on all interersted parties to send me whatever evidence
and arguments they consider relevant for this judgement. If you let me
do all research and judge this on my own, I'll be strongly tempted to
judge simply by submitting a judgement of True or False, without any
further arguments.

Some of you seem to be assuming that I am making good on my once threat
not to support any Proposals unless specially prodded.  In fact, my
recent non-Voting has been more due to a perceived lack of time (although
mysteriously I don't seem to be spending that time on my thesis
instead... procrastinators R us.)

Anyhow, someone actually prodded this time, so here goes:

               3  3  3  3  3  3
               7  7  7  7  7  7
               5  5  5  5  5  6

The comments given have not given me reason to change my Judgement
(although they do indicate that some Players may disagree with its
principles enough to appeal it, I still stand by those principles.)  I
therefore, hereby, submit the following as my official Judgement of CFJ
1096.


On Wed, 3 Jun 1998, Michael Norrish wrote:

Rule 1586 defines:

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

Rule 1793 defines:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

It is my view that a command as above clearly has discernible existence
without the rules - it would be quite possible to make such even if Rule
1793 did not exist.  Thus the part of the statement

'An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that
Rule,'

is false.

It is equally clear that the validity and coercive power (through
penalties) of an Order is derived from the Rules.  So the part of the
statement

'and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some Rules'

is true.  

While the above suffices to determine the Judgement, there are more subtle
issues here, which I wish to detail.  Rule 1513 says:

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.

It is my view that the Rules do _not_ grant such power to Orders.  Compare
the situation for Orders with that of Subordinate Legal Codes:

>From Rule 1591:

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.

>From Rule 1594:

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.


For SLCs, there is a clear granting of powers and requirements.  For
Orders, however, there are only defined Crimes for non-compliance.

In my view, a Crime is not automatically a Rule violation, and thus the
Rules do not in fact require Orders to be followed in the same way as an
SLC.

Thus, the part of the statement

'and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an Order
conflicts with a Rule.'

is true, in the sense that Players, in order to comply with the Rules, may
have to commit a Crime by disobeying an order; however not in the sense
that the entire Order and its penalty is escaped because of the conflict.

I know that several Players think that Crimes should be automatic Rule
Violations, but I think that matter is better settled by legislation.

However, regardless of this issue in particular, at least one part of the
statement is false. 

I therefore judge FALSE.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

My Voting message does not seem to have shown up yet, but:

That Presence Declaration on Proposal 3754 should of course be on Proposal
3757 instead.
