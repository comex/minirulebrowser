This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Taxes, revisited" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      (a) The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Bank is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as
          the Bank's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute
          it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not
          do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      (c) If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for
          any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except
          when specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer
          Order), e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and
          upon conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]
