Proto:  Order of Events Within a Proposal (v1.0)

Amend Rule 594 by adding, after this sentence:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.

this sentence:

      The provisions are implemented in the same order as they appear
      in the text of the Proposal, separated by infinitesimal increments
      of time.

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement:

     This statement is false.

Also, would anyone like a MIDI version of Bach's Musical Offering?  (A bit

I dismiss this statement on the grounds that after a reasonable
effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant information, no
determination can be made of the truth or falsity of its Statement.

I futher transfer one Kudo from Murphy, for wasting the Judge's
and the COTC's time, to Andre, because e's not paid enough. :)

General Chaos is ineligible to serve as Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
933, as he was barred from Judging the original CFJ. See R911.

This is a COE.

I transfer one Kudo from Elde (who is probably too busy searching for a
