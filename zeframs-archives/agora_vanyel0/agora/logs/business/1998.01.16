Hello Agorans,

     After extensive lurking and hours of research (sort of), I've
decided to see what I can contribute to the Agoraverse.
     I hereby request Registration into the Game of Agora as a New
Player.  I wish to use the nickname "Time Agent" in all Agora
matters.

Thank you, my new friends.
-Time Agent-


Jack Handey:
     I guess I kinda lost control, because in the middle of the play
I ran up and lit the evil puppet villain on fire. No, I didn't. Just
kidding. I just said that to help illustrate one of the human
emotions, which is freaking out. Another emotion is greed, as when
you kill someone for money, or something like that. Another emotion
is generosity, as when you pay someone double what he paid for his
stupid puppet.
