Proto: The Treasuror [v1.1]

Create a rule entitled, "The Treasuror", with text:

     There exists an Office called the Treasuror, with a salary equal
     to zero. 

     The Treasuror is elected like any other Office, except that 
     sometime during the Nominating period for the Office, Nominees
     must issue a Budget. Any Nominee who has not issued a Budget is
     not a Candidate for that Election. This rule takes precedence
     over any other rule which may identify Candidates.
     
     A Budget is a list of all Players' names, each with a corresponding
     number of VTs. The number of VTs must be an integral multiple
     of the MUQ of VTs, and cannot be less than zero. The sum of all
     these amounts must be less than or equal to 80 VTs.

     A Budget is issued by posting it to the Public Forum. A Nominee 
     may issue as many Budgets as e wishes, but only the latest Budget
     issued during the Nominating Period of the Election is allowed 
     to be implemented.

     As soon as possible after the Treasuror is elected, e must
     implement eir Budget. E does so by posting it to the Public Forum
     and announcing that e is implementing it. Only the last valid
     Budget e issued in the Nomination Period can be implemented in
     this way.

     At the time the Budget is thus implemented, all outstanding
     Payment Orders are vacated, and all Players' VT holdings are
     set to the values shown in the Budget.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
     these changes from being made.

     One week after the Budget has been implemented, this Rule shall
     repeal itself.

[Comments: 

 v1.0 - This allows us to reset the VT economy to a more certain state,
 to end the current crisis. Rather than choose an arbitrary reset value
 to include in the Proposal, it puts into place the mechanism to reset the
 state with some flexibility, so we can determine the exact values as we
 do best - via political wrangling.

 v1.1 - Realised the language in the old version relied on knowing a long
 of the state which we can't really be sure of - details of many past 
 orders and such. Instead, I have just implemented a one-off blanket 
 vacation of all POs.

 Also added the all important self-repeal clause, so we don't have this
 happening regularly. (Unless people think that might be a good thing?)

H. Promotor,

I hereby pay one P-note from myself to the bank to raise the priority
of my proposal "Monthly voting bills" by one.

BTW, I wonder whether past priority changes were all conducted in the
PF, as required by R1771? Certainly, not all proposals were submitted
in public.

While we're at it, I'd also like to remark on Steve's suggestion to
increase the batch size. I've been thinking about this, too, but don't
think it would be good. Even now we have very little competition for
the top spots in the queue, so the P-note aspect of the economy is
only just making sense.

In addition, note that nearly all entries in the queue were submitted
by General Chaos, who steadfastly refuses to support his proposals
with P-notes. On the metagame level I think this is a very interesting
strategy, and I'd like to see how successful it is. Larger batch sizes
would encourage people, esp. the Promotor with eir privilege, to raise
the priority of Scott's proposals just to fill up the batches, which
would spoil the fun of watching the General's strategy.

Kolja A.

Re: OFF: CFJ 1109 re-assigned to Crito

I hereby judge CFJ 1109 to be FALSE.

Well, there is no interesting interpretive work to be done with this CFJ.  It
"merely" requires a determination of the game state as of the date proposals
3794 and 3795 were distributed.  Unfortunately, there is currently no good
record of the game state on that date, and I have been unable to access the
archives in order to perform calculations that would determine this state
beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, since this is not a CFJ alleging a Crime or Rule violation, R1575
allows me to apply a lesser standard - preponderance of evidence. So:

I have an Accountor's report dated August 1, which shows General Chaos had 4.9
VTs as of that date along with a debt of 0.8 VTs.  I have Registrar reports
that indicate General Chaos has not held any offices since Aug 1, and has
therefore been the recipient of Unemployment Benefits, which were .2 VTs per
week during the time in question.  Unfortunately, I do not have the exact date
of distribution of proposals 3974-5, but it must have occurred sometime between
October 1 and October 20 (when the PO was issued) which means there were a
minimum of 8 weeks of unemployement benefits paid out prior to the
distribution.  I also have evidence from the Assessor at that time (thank you,
Steve) that General Chaos cast only 2 votes during this time period.  Assuming
all debts were paid up before the distribution, General Chaos had a minimum of
4.9 + 1.6 - 2.8 VTs at that time.  Thus, the preponderance of evidence
indicates that G. Chaos had at least 3.7 VTs in eir possession and was subject
to a Duty to Vote. Therefore the judgement of FALSE is supported.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

None.

==========================================================================
Judge Morendil's Arguments:

I hereby enter a summary Judgement of FALSE, based on Rule 1768.
Blob's report of the Commissions of the Infraction pursuant to which
the abovementioned PO was issued falls under the purview of that
Rule, and as such creates a presumption of truth which may only be
set aside "by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary".
Furthermore, the Statement makes no allegations that could be
construed to relate to the commission of a Crime or the violation of
a Rule, and as such does not call for "beyond reasonable doubt"
inquiry under Rule 1575.

Surveying the official record (supplied Caller's arguments, of which
there are none) as well as the unofficial record (Caller's statement
mentioning the number of VTs controlled as of the date of the
Infraction Report, which is besides the point - as the number of VTs
controlled at the time the relevant Proposals were published is the
determining criterion; Caller's statement of ignorance of the number
e actually controls) does not in my opinion constitute "clear and
convincing evidence" of error on the part of the Assessor.

I share to some extent the Caller's reservations about the propriety
of the Assessor's action, but I am afraid that in this instance the
burden of proof is on them.

==========================================================================
Decisions and Arguments of the Justices:

Justice Steve: OVERTURN/REASSIGN

In the matter of the Appeal of CFJ 1089, I hereby overturn Morendil's
Judgement and move to reassign the CFJ.

The argument Judge Morendil gives for his Judgement of FALSE is clearly
inadequate. Morendil invokes R1768, which states that:

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which that
      Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may be set
      aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.

He concludes from this that Assessor Blob's determination that General
Chaos had effective control of 3 VTs at the time when Proposals
3794-3795 were distributed constitutes evidence of the truth of that
claim. But Blob's determination was not part of a "published Report by
an Officer", which in my view refers to Offical Reports, as defined in
R1686. According to that Rule, "[t]he only information that is part of
an Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is part of
that Official Report." Since the Rules do not associate an Official
Report with the Office of Assessor, no information published by the
Assessor falls under the purview of R1768.

However, even if this were not the case, and Blob's determination did
fall under the purview of R1768, Morendil's appeal to that Rule to
justify his Judgement would still have been mistaken. R1768 states that
the presumption of truth may be set aside by clear and convincing
evidence to the contrary. The current case is one where the Judge is
being asked to investigate whether the presumption of truth is supported
by any evidence (R1863: "[The Assessor's] determinations are defeasible
and may be overturned by the Courts.") In such a case, it is my view
that a Judge has a responsibility to discover what evidence there may be
which either supports or undermines the presumption. In particular, I
believe that Judge Morendil had a responsibility to make enquiries of
the Accountor in an attempt to determine what General Chaos' VT holdings
were at the time Proposals 3794-3795 were distributed. By not doing so,
he deprived himself of any basis on which to make a sound Judgement.

This is enough to justify overturning Morendil's Judgement. The
justification for the move to reassign the CFJ is separate. In my view,
the role of the Board of Appeals ought to be one of reviewing the law,
not discovering the facts. Although it would be possible for the Board
to seek the evidence which would allow it to make a determination of the
truth of the Statement, I think that is better left for a new Judge.

==========================================================================
Justice Michael:

I agree with my fellow Justice Steve that Morendil's judgement should
be overturned.  Morendil claims that he has no grounds for doubting
Assessor Blob's decision to bill General Chaos, using R1768 to support
this conclusion.  However, R1768 does not pertain as Blob's issuing of
a Payment Order does not constitute an Officer's Report.

I also agree that it is not the role of the Board of Appeals to
investigate matters of fact (upon which this case undoubtedly rests),
so further recommend that this CFJ be reassigned to a new Judge.

==========================================================================
Justice Murphy:

I overturn and move to reassign the CFJ.

==========================================================================
Evidence attached by the CotC:

Rule 1863/0 (Power=1)
A Duty to Vote

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three
      Voting Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed,
      who is not denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active
      at the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch
      whose Voting Period finishes latest, and who fails to cast a
      vote on any Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of
      Failing to Vote, to be detected and reported by the Assessor.
      The penalty for commission of this Infraction is 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.


Rule 1768/0 (Power=1)
Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Currencies" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) No tangible medium of exchange shall be designated as a
          Currency.

      (e) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination. 
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (f) The Chancellor shall retain and publish at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information for each Currency:
        (1) the designated denomination or denominations of that
            Currency (and if more than one, the relationship between
            them);
        (2) the fraction of the smallest denomination of that Currency
            which is its smallest indivisible unit;
        (3) that Currency's Recordkeepor; and,
        (4) the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency, if any.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The "Recordkeeper" of a Currency refers to the entity who
          has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership of the
          units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules.  Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of a Currency.

      (b) A Currency may have any number of designated Mintors.  A
          Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such designated
          cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are transferred only when the Recordkeepor
      of that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be transferred
      and the entity who is to owner the units thus transferred.  The
      entity receiving the units thus transferred becomes their owner,
      and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      Units of a Currency are created only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from a designated Mintor of that
      Currency, specifying the number of units to be created and the
      entity who is to own the units so created.  The specified entity
      owns the units so created, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      Units of a Currency are destroyed only when the Recordkeepor of
      that Currency receives a notice from the owner of one or more
      units of that Currency, specifying the units to be destroyed. 
      The Recordkeepor shall note this destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of a Currency is required to record every
          transfer for which e receives a transfer notice denominated
          in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor, when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably designated to
          be the Accountor.  The smallest indivisible unit for this
          Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as a Currency.  The
          sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably designated to
          be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.  The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1846 be amended to read:

      (a) Ergs are hereby designated as a Currency.  The sole
          designated Mintor of Ergs is the Bank.  The Recordkeepor of
          Ergs is irrevocably designated to be the Cartographor.

      (b) The Cartographor constructively agrees to act as
          Recordkeepor for Ergs by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time.  An entity which has legal
|         existence solely as a result of this subdivision is called
|         "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
|         by that entity as of the time it entered Probate are deemed
|         to be satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
          how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
          the event that it becomes dissolute.

      (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
          the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
          bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary.  The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
          time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
          the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the
          Notary, but a Trustee may determine, through examination of
          any relevant evidence found by or presented to em, that the
          entity of which e is Trustee had an unfiled Will superseding

        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) The Recordkeepor of the Currency named in a tax levy shall,
          as soon as possible after the announcement, provide a report

          announcement was made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal.  This debt
