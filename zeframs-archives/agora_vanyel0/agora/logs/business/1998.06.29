I hereby transfer 0.5 VTs to the Bank to satisfy the first of these POs.
I hereby transfer 1 Indulgence to the Bank to satisfy the second of these
POs.

I have thought about this and I do not believe that it is possible to
satisfy the second of these POs.

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following statement:

      It is not possible to satisfy a PO requiring the transfer of
      0.5 Indulgences.

Argument:
      By Rule 1598, when issuing a TO, one must specify "a number
      of units of that Currency which is a positive multiple of
      that Currency's MUQ."  In the case of Indulgences the
      smallest such number is 1.  However, according to Rule 1732
      "a Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order to the
      payee of that Payment Order for the currency and amount
      named in that Payment Order is successfully executed." Thus
      one is  obviously unable to issue a TO that can satisfy a
      PO for 0.5 Indulgences.

It is now over 6 hours since the Parcel was passed to Murphy. Therefore
he is out of the Contest (sorry Murphy) and the Parcel passes to Kolja.

At 6:10pm the Music paused the second time, and the second Layer of
the Parcel is unwrapped. The Contents, 1 VT, goes to Murphy, even
though e isn't a Contestant anymore, because th Regulations say that
the contents go to the last _Player_ to hold the Parcel, not the
last Contestant.

This isn't quite as exciting as it might have been. Perhaps it
would be worth re-running it over a week rather than a single day.
I hope Kolja gets back soon, so we can actually get this Parcel 
moving!

I wanted to wait until I was passed the parcel, but that may be a while,
if it happens at all.

Happy 5th Birthday, Agora!

The third pause in the Music was scheduled for 2pm, which was an hour ago.
Murphy gets the contents of the third Layer too, which was 1.0 VT. But I
am tempted to call this game off, due to lack of participation. :(

If I can get the agreement of the other Contestants I'll change th
Regulations appropriately. What do other people think?
