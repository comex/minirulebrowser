I note that no Revolt in the past has occurred solely for the aim of
keeping a particular clique of Players in Office while installing a
new Speaker.  I note further that traditional Agoran ethics have
always been to ensure that Officers adversely affected by a scam where
in on the deal and given a chance to prepare for the extra work. 

Hon. Herald,

I transfer a Kudo from Steve, for forgetting his Agoran ethics, to
Morendil, because he has been cruelly ousted from the Office of
Speaker, one in which he was performing very well.

Michael.

Please note that a good deal of this judgement hinges on a form of
Rule 376 which no longer exists.

======================================================================

Call For Judgement 707

The Judge is    Vanyel

Caller:         Steve
Date:           Thu, 13 Oct 1994 14:06:16 +1000 (EST)

Barred Players: Kelly, Chuck, Wili

Judge:          Vanyel
Date Assigned:  Thu Oct 13 09:21:53 EDT 1994
Date Judged:    Fri, 14 Oct 1994 17:37:04 -0500 (CDT)

The Judgement:  FALSE

Scorekeepor:    Player Vanyel receives 5 points for Speedy Judgement.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Statement:

Steve legally voted FOR (and did not legally vote AGAINST) Proposal 1177.
Hence, the votes on that Proposal were not 11 FOR, 13 AGAINST as reported
by the Speaker, but in fact were tied 12 FOR, 12 AGAINST.
---------------

Argument:

Firstly, the facts. I haven't the precise date-stamps on me, but I
remember the approximate sequence of events: (times are GMT+1000)

1. Early Tuesday morning. The Voting Period on the Grey Repeals
   closes. Shortly afterward Speaker Chuck attempts to publish
   the Results of the Grey Repeals. The attempt is a failure.

2. Tuesday afternoon, about 1630, Steve sends a message both to
   Speaker Chuck and to the Public Forum, arguing that he may still
   vote on the Grey Repeals, as the Results have not been published.
   The argument is reproduced below.

3. Early Wednesday morning, about 0100, Speaker Chuck acknowledges
   the failure of his first to publish the Results of the Grey Repeals,
   and he resends them.

Now, the Rules. The Voting Period is defined in Rule 693:

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal shall be seven days,
      beginning at the time that the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

This is the time identified in (1). However, Rule 376 states in part:

      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

So the "moment of the completion of the vote" is identified in (3).
It is my contention that all votes received on the Grey Repeals
before this time are legal votes in good standing. In particular,
my vote FOR Proposal 1177 was a legal vote FOR that Proposal.

My argument rests entirely on the premise that the time referred to
in Rule 376 as "the moment of the completion of the vote" legally
defines the latest time before which votes may be legally cast. In
defence of this premise I appeal to nothing more or less than the
Judge's intuitions about the meaning of this phrase. I concede
that Rules 693 and, implicitly, 955, attempt to define a different
and earlier time, namely (1), as the latest time before which votes
may be legally cast. But Rule 376 takes precedence over both these
Rules.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Judgement:

JUDGMENT OF CFJ 707:            FALSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Explanation of Judgment:

        As I see it, there are two issues in this CFJ: what time various
posts should be considered to reach the Public Forum, and what the latest
time votes can be cast is.
        First I will consider which occurred first, Steve's Vote, or
Chuck's post of the Rules.  I have set up a table of times at which
events occurred: the time Sent, the time Teleport received and
redistributed it, and the time it was Received by Kelly:

(Times converted to GMT)

                        Time/Date Sent Recd by Teleport Rec'd by Kelly

Chuck's first posting:  12.10 05:05:56  12.10 15:10:27  12.10 15:22:15
Chuck's second posting: 12.10 13:13:01  12.10 13:22:00  12.10 13:54:58
Steve's posting:        12.10 08:46:29  12.10 08:46:40  12.10 09:00:01

        So we see that if we take the Time/Date Sent, Chuck's posting
of the Ruleset will have beaten Steve's post by over 3 hours.  However,
if we take the Time/Date Recd (by Kelly, for that's who sent me the
files), Steve's post was first.  Kelly has pointed out that her
service is unreliable for timing; we can see through Chuck's second
posting that it took the mail about a half hour to get there.  And
her point that we cannot count on the "Received" datestamps are
well taken; if this were the case, different Rules would at times
apply to different people.  This is clearly unacceptable.
        Yet, if we take the "Date" (ie Time Sent) datestamps, then
we can also have problems; what if the posting got lost or delayed on
its way to the listserver?  Clearly, the Players of Agora cannot be
expected to follow Rules they never received.  Yet we also cannot count
on individual Players Receiving posts at certain times.  Thus, I am
forced to conclude that the best possible time to reckon by is the
latest time which applies to all of Agora: the time when the listserver
(at this time, nomic-discussion@teleport.com) receives the post.
Reckoning in this manner, Steve's change-of-vote occurred almost
five hours before the posting of results of the Grey Repeals by Chuck.
        The second issue is whether Steve was legally able to change
his Vote at that time.  There is no Rule specifically changing one's
Vote, therefore it is allowed by Rule 116.  But did Steve try to change
his Vote after he was no longer able to Vote on the "Grey Repeals"?
        In Rule 693 it states that "The prescribed Voting Period for
a Proposal shall be seven days, beginning at the time that the Proposal
is distributed to all Players."  By this we have that the so-called
"Voting Period" was over at the time of Steve's post, which was more
than 7 days after the Grey Repeals were first posted.  By Rule 208
we find that "At the end of the prescribed Voting Period on a
Proposal, the Speaker shall reveal all Votes legally cast on that
Proposal."  We know that the "Voting Period" had ended, yet the
Speaker had not yet revealed the Votes legally cast.  The Speaker
was derelict in his duties to reveal the Votes, but this does
not negate the fact that the Voting Period was, in fact, over.
        Thus, as the Voting Period was over, *even though Speaker
Chuck had not revealed votes*, Player Steve was several hours too late
to change his Vote.
        HOWEVER, there is a Rule which throws a wrench into the analysis.
It is Rule 376, "When Does a Rule Change Take Effect?".  It states that
"The moment of the completion of the vote is definged by the date and
time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic listserver
message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing the result of the
vote on the corresponding proposal.  Since 376 has a lower number than
693, it takes precedence.  The major discrepancy becomes whether
"vote" and "voting period" are the same.  In many democratic models,
one can see the use of "end of vote" to mean, not the end of the ability
of people to vote, but the completion of all aspects of the vote,
including tallying and publication of the result.  I shall choose
this interpretation because, I will admit, it is highly convenient
to do so, and eliminates a Rule conflict.  Assuming this interpretation
merely makes Rule 376 define when rule changes take effect (as was,
most likely, the intent) and leaves the definition of the ability
to vote to other Rules (specifically, 693).
        In any case, I judge FALSE on this CFJ: Steve did, in fact,
vote AGAINST 1177 and did *NOT* change his vote to FOR.

PROTO: Ownership of Rules

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Rulemeister}

     There shall be an Office of Rulemeister.  The Rulemeister shall
     keep a Record of all Rules that are Owned and the Entities that Own 
     those Rules.  E shall publish and Official Report each week that 
     contains this information, the changes made since the last such 
     report, and the reasons for those changes.

{Comment: This idea requires a signifigant workload, so there should be
          a new Office to deal with it outside of the Rulekeepor, who 
          would otherwise be the natural person to deal with this.
          However, if the Rulekeepor is willing (now e doesn't deal
          with the virus and attributions) I can change this.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Inital Ownership of Rules}

     Every Rule is either Owned or Unowned.  All Rules that exist when 
     this Rule is created are initally Unowned.  All Rules that are 
     created after this Rule is in force shall be initally Owned by the 
     entity that proposed the creation of that Rule, or if there is no 
     such entity, then that Rule shall be initally Unowned.

     This Rule only specifies the inital state of a Rule.  This Rule 
     does not forbid changes in the Ownership status of any Rule.

{Comment: Gives a starting point, defining the inital status of the
          Rules.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Rule Auction}

     If a week begins and there are at least two Unowned Rules, the 
     Rulemeister shall select two Unowned Rules at random and hold them 
     up for public auction. The Rulemeister is not permitted to bid in 
     this Auction. The Rulemeister must publish an announcement of the 
     auction in the Public Forum, along with the full text of the Rules 
     being held up for bidding as soon as possible after the start of
     the week.

     Bids must be in a single currency minted by the Bank. The
     Rulemeister shall select the currency for the bids and announce it 
     at the same time as e announces the auction.  Bids shall be for 
     both selected Rules, and shall be sent by a Player to the
     Rulemeister in private.  Public bids, bids not in the proper 
     currency, bids that aren't in a multiple of the currency's MUQ, or 
     bids that aren't higher than all previous bids, shall all be 
     ignored by the Rulemeister.

     One week from the announcement of the auction, if there is a 
     highest bid, the Rulemeister shall award Ownership of both
     Auctioned Rules to the Player who submitted the highest bid and 
     bill that Player for the value of the bid.  If there was no highest 
     bid, then the Rulemeister shall award Ownership of both Rules to a 
     random Player.  These awards shall be made by the Rulemeister, in
     the Public Forum, as soon as possible.

{Comment: Obviously, if an Auction Rule is developed, I'd like to use
          that instead.  The idea here is to propagate ownership of 
          Rules.  I'm doing this in pairs becaue it might help inspire 
          trading if for every Rule that someone wants, they get a Rule 
          they might not want.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Transfering Ownership of Rules}

     The Ownership of a Rule shall only change as follows;

       i) When the Rules direct the Rulemeister to award Ownership of an 
          Unowned Rule to a given Player, that Player becomes Owner of 
          that Rule when the Rulemeister posts the award in the Public
          Forum.

      ii) If the Executor of a Rule's Owner informs the Rulemeister that 
          e is awarding Ownership of that Rule to another entity, then 
          that entity becomes the Rule's Owner.

     iii) If a Player who Owns a Rule ceases to be a Player, then that 
          Rule becomes Unowned.  If an entity that Owns a Rule ceases to 
          exist, then that Rule becomes Unowned.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit a change 
     in a Rule's Ownership not described in this Rule.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Owner's Vote}

     If a Proposal Amends or Repeals a Rule, and the Owner of that Rule 
     is not the entity that made the Proposal, then the Owner of that 
     Rule is permitted to cast an additional two votes above and beyond 
     all others e is permitted to cast on the Proposal. This does not 
     make the Owner a Voting Entity if e is not one already, nor does it 
     increase the absolute maximum number of votes allowed to a Voting 
     Entity.

{Comment:  This is the basic benefit for owning a Rule (another one
           might be free Proposals to amend it) this gives the Owner a 
           disproportionate influence on the Proposals that affect the 
           Rules e Owns.  It is also incentive to buy Rules, to protect 
           parts of the Game you're fond of...}

H. CotC Jeff,

I hereby submit the following Call for Judgement, barring Michael and
Morendil.

Statement:

      Speaker Steve is not Tainted.

Relevant Rules: R1648, R1664, R402

Argument:

The recent Revolt has brought to light an unclarity in the Rules
dealing with Speaker Taintedness which should be cleared up quickly.
I don't intend to argue for a Judgement of TRUE; I'll just bring the
issues before the Judge for eir consideration.

Rule 1648/2 (Power=1)
When the Speaker is Tainted

      The Speaker is Tainted whenever the Player who is Speaker became
      Speaker by any means other than a normal Speaker transition.

      A normal Speaker transition occurs whenever the Rules require
      the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

      If the Rules require the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and
      that Office is held temporarily, the Speaker-Elect still becomes
      Speaker, but the resulting Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, the Speaker-Elect shall become Speaker.

The first paragraph makes it clear that the question of whether 
I am a Tainted Speaker is equivalent to the question of whether I
become Speaker by means of a normal Speaker Transition. It is this
which is unclear.

The second paragraph defines a normal Speaker Transition. Clearly,
the Rules - R1664 (Rebellion), to be exact - did require the
Speaker-Elect to become Speaker. At the time of the Revolt, I
did hold the Office of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion, so
if we read the second paragraph as applying the test for holding
the Office in the normal fashion at the earliest time at which
the Rules required the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, then I
became Speaker by means of a normal Speaker Transition and so
am not Tainted.

However, other times of applying the test are possible. R402
sets out the procedure which is to be followed when the Speaker-
Elect becomes Speaker, including the case where this happens
due to a Revolt:

     Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the
          Speaker-Elect has become the Speaker.  At the "Date:" of
          the Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall cease to be
          Speaker and the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.

>From R402, we see that when a Revolt occurs, although the Rules
first begin to *require* that the Speaker-Elect become Speaker at
the time the Revolt occurs, the Speaker-Elect does not actually *become*
Speaker until step 3 of the Speaker Transition process is completed.
At that time, due to the Revolt itself, I did not hold the Office
of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion, but rather held it temporarily.

This, then, is what the Judge must decide: does R1648 apply its test
for holding the Office of Speaker-Elect in the normal fashion at the
time that the Rules first require that the Speaker-Elect become Speaker
(in this case, at the time of the Revolt), or at the time that the
Speaker-Elect actually becomes Speaker, at the completion of step 3
of the Speaker Transition process?
