As a result of the above vacations, pursuant to Rule 1734, I hereby issue the
following re-payment POs:

The Bank is hereby commanded to pay 1 P-Note to Steve.
The Bank is hereby commanded to pay 1 P-Note to Blob.

P.S.  Blob, several of the Voting POs vacated here were also already satisfied
and will require you to issue repayment POs.  I'll provide a list of those in
the report I'll send you in a bit.
