This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Unlimited Voting" and is to
have Adoption Index 2.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."

Protoproposal: You're in the Army Now v1.0

Create a rule, titled "The Agoran Standing Army", with text:

      There exists a group of players known as "The Agoran Standing
      Army" (or "the Army"). All players who are members of this
      group are Soldiers. players who are not members of the group
      are called Civilians. Initially all players are Civilians. A
      player may only join or leave this group as defined by the 
      rules.

      The Speaker may not become a Soldier. If a Soldier becomes
      Speaker, e immediately becomes a Civilian. This condition 
      takes precedence over any other rule which may allow the 
      Speaker to be a Soldier.

Create a rule, titled "The Commander-in-Chief", with text:

      There exists an Office of Commander-in-Chief.

      This Office is not filled in the standard way. It may only
      ever be held by a Soldier, or else by the Speaker. If the
      Commander-in-Chief becomes a Civilian, then e is removed
      from Office.

      If the Speaker is the Commander-in-Chief, then e must as
      soon as possible promote a Soldier to the Office. 

      It is the job of the Commander-in-Chief to keep track of which
      Players are Soldiers, and who their Commanding Officers are.
      E shall post this information to the Public Forum each week.
      This is eir Official Report.

      The Commander-in-Chief has no salary.

Create a rule, titled "The Chain of Command", with text:

      Each Soldier may have zero, one or two other Soldiers, of whom e
      is the Commanding Officer. Every Soldier must have exactly one
      Commanding Officer, except for the Commander-in-Chief, who has
      none.

      A Soldier's Rank is an integer value, one more than eir 
      Commanding Officer's Rank. The Commander-in-Chief has Rank 1.

Create a rule, titled "Recruitment", with text:

      A Soldier may recruit a willing Civilian to be in eir Command, 
      provided the following conditions hold:

      (1) The Soldier already has fewer than two Soldiers in eir 
          Command.
      (2) The Civilian is eligible to be a Soldier.
      (3) The Civilian has posted a message to the Public Forum in 
          the past week indicating eir desire to become a Soldier,
          and has not since withdrawn that statement.
    
      To recruit the Civilian, the Soldier shall post to the Public
      Forum indicating that the Civilian is now a Soldier under eir
      Command. At the time of this posting, the Civilian becomes a
      Soldier.

Create a rule, titled "Promotion", with text:

      [Not sure how to word this one yet, see comments below for
       description of the desired mechanism.]

Create a rule, titled "Leaving the Forces", with text:

      A Soldier may leave the Army and become a Civilian at any time
      by posting a message to the Public Forum stating that e does
      so.

Create a rule, titled "Keep Our Forces Clean", with text:

      A Player who has more than five Blots is not eligible to be
      a Soldier. Any Soldier who has more than five Blots must
      leave the Army as soon as possible.

Amend Rule 1873 to read:

      A Soldier who is not denied Voting Privileges at the time a 
      batch of Proposals is distributed, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting
      Period finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any 
      Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of Failure to 
      Vote, to be detected and reported by the Commander-in-Chief.
      The penalty for commission of this Infraction is one Blot and
      one Voting Token.
 
Create a rule, "A Soldier's Pay", with text:

      A Soldier's Pay is calculated in the following way:

      (1) A Soldier who has no recruits has Pay equal to one-tenth
          of the Basic Officer Salary.

      (2) A Soldier who has one or two recruits has Pay equal to 
          the sum of eir recruits' Pay, plus one-tenth of the Basic
          Officer Salary.

      At the beginning of each month, the Commander-in-Chief shall
      pay out to each Soldier an amount equal to eir Pay.

[Comments: 
 1.0 - A rough draft of an idea I had. Basic idea is that we have 
       a bunch of Soldiers arranged in a strict hierarchy, with the
       CinC at the top. Players become Soldiers by being recruited by
       other Players. 

       Soliders have a Duty to Vote all the time, but are compensated
       by receiving extra pay (on top of unemployment benefits, or
       officer salaries). Pay increases as you recruit more soldiers.

       Because soldiers have to be relatively Immaculate, and because
       it is not in the interests of a Commanding Officer to lose
       anyone under eir Command (or else eir pay is cut), the Army
       ought to display a certain amount of "looking after its own",
       making sure that underlings can afford to vote, and covering
       any Blots before they get out of control.

       I have not, as yet, tackled the problem of rearranging the
       hierarchy when a Soldier leaves the Army. What I want to do
       is fairly straightforward, but difficult to express neatly.

       Say the situation is thus:

                               Blob 
                              /    \
                          Chuck    Steve
                          /\        /   \
                       Chuck's   Peekee  Michael
                      recruits    /  \         /\
                              elJefe Oerjan   Michael's
                                              recruits

       And Steve decides to leave the forces to pursue a career as
       an encyclopedia salesman. Then I, as eir Commanding Office,
       should choose one of eir recruits to replace em, say, Peekee.

                               Blob 
                              /    \
                          Chuck    Peekee
                          /\        /   \
                       Chuck's    ????  Michael
                      recruits    /  \        /\
                              elJefe Oerjan   Michael's
                                              recruits

       Now Peekee gains Steve's other recruit, Michael in his command,
       and gets to choose one of eir old recruits, say Oerjan, to 
       promote.

                               Blob 
                              /    \
                          Chuck    Peekee
                          /\        /   \
                       Chuck's   Oerjan  Michael
                      recruits    /           /\
                              elJefe        Michael's
                                            recruits

       If Oerjan had recruits, then the process would continue, 
       until the chain of promotions comes to an end.

       The same problem exists when a Soldier becomes CinC. E leaves
       a gap in the command hierarchy which should be filled in 
       this way.

       I have also considered adding a maximum depth to this
       hierarchy, to discourage long chains. The sensible limit 
       would be the logarithm to the base 2 of the number of Players,
       rounded up. Which would in our current situation be four.]
