This is the "Late Judgements" proto, with minor changes.  I will propose
this imminently if noone has further comments.


ProtoProposal
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days after
      e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT and
      the Judgement or dismissal is legal even though delivered late.
      Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes ineligible to
      Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven days
      after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes ineligible
      to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal submitted after
      this time is not legal and shall not be accepted by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be eligible
      before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither required
      nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or dismiss, that CFJ,
      and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that CFJ at the moment e
      becomes ineligible.


Amend Rule 591 by deleting the sentence:

      A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1565 by deleting the text ", and only when issued by the Judge
within the permitted deliberation period"

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1447 by changing the last sentence to read

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their determinations.


{Comments:
1.) The CotC must accept late judgements, provided they reach the CotC before e
reports the Judge for failure to judge.

2.) Late Judgements are penalized (1 VT plus loss of Judicial salary).
However, Judges should not rest easy because the CotC may at any moment
reassign the CFJ if it is not judged, and then the penalty is 3 blots.

3.) The CotC has discretion on when to guillotine the lateness period, but
at most one week.}

4.) I've reworded the last paragraph of Rule 408 to omit the troublesome
phrase "prior to the end of the permitted time", which phrase is not really
relevant anyway.

-- elJefe

H. CotC elJefe!

I hereby make the following CFJ, barring Harlequin.

Statement:

      Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with lower
      precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
      purely discussionary nature.

Relevant Rules: 1023, 1729

Argument:

R1023 contains the following provision:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

The 'ordering requirement' referred to is, of course, that of the
ASAP Rule. But this is irrelevant to the Statement. The provision,
I claim, has two distinct effects: it excludes discussionary activity
from the ASAP ordering requirement (a curious provision, since no-one
has ever been required to discuss anything), and it enforces the
permissibility of discussion at any time. These two effects are quite
independent of each other. So, for the purposes of judging the CFJ,
I would say that the relevant part of R1023 reads:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature...may be conducted at
      any time.

As far as I know, this provision has never had any effect before. On
the other hand, no Rule has ever sought to prohibit discussion before.
Before, that is, R1729, which states, concerning Insane Proposals, that:

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been bended.

Leaving aside the question of whether there is an important distinction
between breaking the Rules and bending them, this Rule clearly seeks to
make some kinds of discussion illegal. This brings it into conflict with
R1023, a conflict which it loses, illustrating in a particular case,
the general truth of the Statement.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R1023 with a copy of the Statement and the list of Relevant
Rules.
