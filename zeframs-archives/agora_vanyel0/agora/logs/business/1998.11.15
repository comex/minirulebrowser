I suggested this a month or more ago, but no-one seemed to care for it 
much. It is now much later, and we still don't have an Accountor's Report.
And no disrespect intended to Lee, but it doesn't look like we're going
to have one soon. (Lee, please correct me if I'm wrong.) So once again,
I suggest that we should reset the VT holdings to a known baseline, so
we can start operating a viable economy again.

Any reset is bound to be unfair to some people, so I have an idea for
a way to try to find the most popular set of reset values, and have a
bit of fun in the meantime.

Proto: The Treasurer

Create a rule entitled, "The Treasuror", with text:

     There exists an Office called the Treasuror, with a salary equal
     to zero. 

     The Treasuror is elected like any other Office, except that 
     sometime during the Nominating period for the Office, Nominees
     must issue a Budget. Any Nominee who has not issued a Budget is
     not a Candidate for that Election. This rule takes precedence
     over any other rule which may identify Candidates.
     
     A Budget is a list of Players' names, each with a corresponding
     number of VTs. A Budget may also specify a default number of VTs
     for Players not explicitly listed. If no default is given, it is
     set to zero.

     A Budget is issued by posting it to the Public Forum. A Nominee 
     may issue as many Budgets as e wishes, but only the latest Budget
     issued during the Nominating Period of the Election is allowed 
     to be implemented.

     As soon as possible after the Treasuror is elected, e must
     implement eir Budget. This is done by issuing orders to vacate 
     all outstanding Payment Orders for Voting Tokens, and then 
     issuing Payment Orders for the Bank to pay out, to each player,
     the number of VTs, specified in eir final Budget. If a Player 
     is not explicitly specified in the Budget, then e is paid an 
     amount equal to the default number.

     The Treasuror is permitted and empowered to issue all the orders
     required by this Rule.

This message contains one or more Proposals.  Each Proposal begins
immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Cleanup of R.1445" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominations Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating the e wished to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "More Cleanups" and is to have
Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1048 be amended to read:

      (a) A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an
          existing Category to which the new Rule will be assigned. 
          If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's
          Category.  When doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new
          Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new Category.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees
          fit.

      (c) If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must
          announce it in the Public Forum no later than the first
          subsequent publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      (d) The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
          Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
          Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category.  Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) The Rule Number
        (2) The Rule's Amendment Number
        (3) The Rule's Power
        (4) The Rule's Title
        (5) The Rule's text
        (6) Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) A brief description of each Category
        (2) Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in
          the FLR.

**END PROPOSAL

The following Proposal is to be titled "Cleanup of R.1006" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

immediately after a line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends
immediately before the first following line marked "**END PROPOSAL".

The following Proposal is to be titled "Proposal of the Week" and is
to have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.
