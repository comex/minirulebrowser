You left out a word up there.  This is a COE, I guess.

     THE AGORAN DAILY JOURNAL
     Volume 42, Issue 1
     Wednesday, October 1, 1997

Recent events:

* The Probate system remains not-as-intended:  Rule 1738 attempts
  to limit Executors in Probate to disposing of the assets of
  deregistered Players, but Rule 1478 takes precedence and says
  that they may act generally on behalf of the deregistered
  Player.

  Morendil is thus controlling Elde, who in turn is controlling
  Blob, and the trio has had all manner of fun with the situation -
  including forming a Group called The Voodoo Lounge.  (Notary
  Murphy, who assigns Executors in Probate, has also joined the
  Group.)

* The Appeals Court is reviewing Elde's decision (actually Morendil
  acting as Elde) that Proposal 3533 (the Pragmatic Currencies reform)
  accidentally destroyed all Voting Tokens.  The debate hinges on
  whether the intermediate Game States in the middle of a Proposal's
  implementation can have side effects.

  Among the side effects of upholding the decision are four previously
  undetected Wins - two for Steve, one for Morendil, and one for
  Andre.  (You Win by Proposal if three of your Proposals in a row
  get exactly the same number of FOR/AGAINST Votes.  With no Voting
  Tokens, all 17 Proposals since Pragmatic Currencies got a 0-0 result.

  The other Rule-defined Currencies (Proposal Notes and Indulgences)
  survived because the Rules defining them take precedence over the
  Rule attempting to cause their destruction.

* Antimatter deregistered last month and is now eligible to be
  reregistered by Harlequin, eir Executor in Probate.

* Calabresi and Vanyel are Maybe Absent.  If they don't post to the
  Public Forum within two weeks, they may be deregistered for
  inactivity.

* Rule 693 (which defines a Proposal's Voting Period) has recovered
  from its Viral Infection.  It is debated whether Proposals
  submitted during the time of the Infection have their Voting
  Period begin at the time of their submission, at the time of
  the Disinfection, or whether they are completely deprived of
  a Voting Period.

* A Call For Judgement claiming that the Frankenstein Rule became
  impossible to amend (which would grant Murphy a Win by Pitchfork)
  was Judged FALSE.  However, the CFJ incorrectly specified the date
  of the supposed event, anyway.

* Proposal 3552 (Steve) - All Votes must be sent to the Public
                          Forum; Rule self-repeals after 60 days
  Proposal 3553 (Andre) - Rule 1065 (penalizing those who submit
                          too many Proposals) is repealed
  Proposal 3554 (Andre) - Players in their Grace Period are not
                          penalized for disqualifying themselves
                          from Judging a CFJ already assigned to them

* Murphy Rebels.  One more Rebel will trigger a Rebellion.

* Kolja A. creates the Currency "Koljenka".
  Oerjan creates the Currency "Euclids", with Minimum Unit
    Quantity of pi.

Might as well admit this one. The significant part of the posting should
read:

I am incorrectly assigned as Justice on these appeals.  According to
the dates in the history, these appeals were perfected on October 1st,
after I ceased to be Speaker.  Steve, and not I, should be Justice as
Speaker for these appeals.

This is a Claim of Error.

I intended to post the Regulations of the Democratic Movement on Vlad's
request, but could not find them.

Because:
 1. I cannot find the Regulations
 2. The Contest has existed for months, if not years, without doing anything
    useful
 3. I have been warned a few months ago that its regulations regarding
    Contest Fee were illegal, making it impossible for new Contestants to
    enter, and still have not done anything about it.
 4. I know the Contestants (which is only me at the moment) can do so, either
    by mutual agreement or by an internal vote that immediately passes when
    all have voted for can do so,

I hereby dissolve the Democratic Movement.

I wish to make clear that this does not mean that I have left its ideals, and
that I might try under other or maybe even under the same circumstances to
revive it.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.
Decision of the Justiciar: TRUE (sustaining the original Judgement)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Judge Elde/Morendil argues that during implementation of the Proposal, a
rule change caused the Mint to cease being a mintor when it was the mintor
of VTs, before another rule change made the Bank the mintor of VTs.

There are several different interpretations on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented, which may affect the argument.  (For example, if
the provisions are implemented simultaneously, then the Mint did not cease
to be a mintor _before_ the Bank was mintor.)

But no matter which interpretation is chosen, it remains that the Mint
_did_ cease to have Mint Authority.  CFJ 828 (Destruction of Group Coins)
teaches that this is enough to satisfy the precise wording of Rule 1579,
even if it could be shown that VTs had a mintor at every legally
significant time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Original Judge's argument

Proposal 3533, the Pragmatic Currencies proposal, was implemented under
authority of Rule 594.  Judge Elde argues that at the time Rule 1470 was
amended (depriving the Mint of Mint Authority),  Rule 1696 still named the
Mint as the Mintor for VTs. The conclusion is that Rule 1579 acted at that
moment to destroy all Voting Tokens.


2. How the provisions of a Proposal are implemented

There are several interpretations of the Rules on how the provisions of a
Proposal are implemented.

The Sequential View:   Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules then in effect, and the Game State is
                       adjusted to include consequent effects of this before
                       turning to the next provision.

The Atomic View:       Each provision is implemented in order, if allowed
                       by the Rules in effect at the adoption of the Proposal,
                       but no consequent effects cause an adjustment to the
                       Game State until all provisions have been dealt with.

The Simultaneous View: All the provisions are considered to be implemented
                       simultaneously,  if allowed by the Rules in effect
                       at the adoption of the Proposal, except where
                       dependencies among the provisions require that some
                       are implemented in sequence with other ones.

All three of these are consistent with the Rules, and the choice between
them must therefore rest on "game custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
the best interests of the game."

The present decision does not require us to choose among these, and thus we
refrain from expressing an opinion as to which is preferred.


3.  Destruction of Game Coins, CFJ 828

It's fair to compare the present situation to the one arising in CFJ 828.
In that case, Proposal 1760 had revamped the Group rules but had forgotten
to provide that each Group was the mintor of its own Group Coins, or in
fact that Groups were permitted to be the mintors of anything.  However, a
Rule (1467) provided that "The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is
not otherwise defined."

But the clear meaning of Rule 1471, worded very much like the two most
recent forms of Rule 1579, is that when one entity ceases to have authority
to mint a currency and another begins to have that authority in its stead,
then that currency is indeed destroyed.

The judgement in CFJ 828 states:
>Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
>Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
>issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
>authority now going to the Mint.
>
>Rule 1471/0 states that
>
>   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
>                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
>   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
>   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.
>
>
>Therefore the old Coins ceased to exist upon adoption of Proposal 1760.
[...]
>
>Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
>by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change
>of Mintor means that one entity ceased to have the authority and another
>one began having it.


Rule 1579/1 partly stated:
      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

Rule 1579/2 partly stated:
      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.


The inclusion of "designated" in Rule 1579/1 is not enough to change the
result.  The meaning of "mintor" and "designated mintor" have at all times
been the same, namely the mintor designated by the Rules.

Thus I rule that the statement was correctly judged TRUE.


Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar


=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

This is something that I've wanted to do for a long time, and the latest
hassles with the currency system combined with a quote from someone about
Agoran Economics being nothing like a Currency Market and more like
a barter of Commodities, I finally sat down and wrote it.  (Probably
as a relaxation exercise to reduce the stress of my upcoming marriage-- 
48 hours, yipes! :))

So here is the rough first part of a PROTO, still being finished, that
completly wipes the Currency paradigm from the game.  The individual "Currencies"
remain, in a different guise, but I've done a lot to abolish the attempt
to shoehorn currency-centric concepts into the "economy."

Even so, I have tried hard to keep the Pragmatic form of the prior
Currency reform in place-- there are no automagical happenings without
a Player doing something, and if the player doesn't do something, it doesn't
get done, so there's no gamestate indeterminancy in my model.  (Brave words 
which I'll probably live to eat.)

Bear in mind that this is unfinished, there are a _lot_ of amendments that
still need to be added, but below is the heart of the Proposal.


Swann

PROTO:Objects
============================================================
PART I: Objects in General

The Rule Category "Currencies" is re-named "Objects"

Rule 1467 has its title change from "Definition of a Currency"
to "Definition of an Object"

Amend Rule 1467 (Definition of a Currency) to read as follows;

     There are entities known as Objects.  An entity is only an 
     Object if the Rules designate it as such.  All Objects, and all
     Classes of Objects conform to the following strictures:

       i) All individual Objects must be a member of one, and only one, 
          Class of Objects explicitly defined in the Rules.
      ii) All individual Objects are owned by one, and only one, entity. 
          Whenever the Rules do not specify an owner of an individual 
          Object, the owner of that individual Object is the Bank.
     iii) All Objects are indivisible. Entities may only own an integral 
          number of Objects.
      iv) An Object that is a member of Class X may be referred to as an
          X. (Where X is the name of the Class of Object.)
       v) Each Class of Objects has a Recordkeepor who must keep a
          current Record of all entities that own Objects belonging to 
          that Class, and the number of those Objects each entity 
          possesses.  If the Rules specify no Recordkeepor for an 
          Class of Objects, that Recordkeepor is the Chancellor.

     This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule defining the 
     properties of Objects or Classes of Objects.

{Comment: This begins a general pragmatic infrastructure to replace the
          current currency bureaucracy.  Currencies are to be replaced
          by Objects, with a much more general structure.}


Rule 1576 has its title change from "Names of Currencies" to
"Classes of Objects"

Rule 1576 (Names of Currencies) is amended to read as follows;

      Each Class of Object shall have a name, which must be distinct
      from the name of any other Class of Object.

      Any attempt to create a Class of Object with the same name as an
      already existing Class of Object fails.


Rule 1577 (Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)) is repealed.
{Comment: Objects are atomic entities.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Convertibility of Objects}

     The Rules can specify that a certain number of Objects of one Class 
     are Convertible into a certain number of Objects of another Class. 
     Objects in the first Class may be referred to as Convertible 
     Objects.

     Convertibility means that if the Rules specify that N Objects of 
     Class X are Convertible into M Objects of Class Y (Where N and M 
     are two non-zero Integers and X and Y are two different Classes of 
     Objects.  In this case the Object from Class X is the Convertible 
     Object.), then any entity that owns N Objects of Class X may 
     Convert those Objects into M Objects of Class Y.
     
     Entities may only Convert Convertible Objects by methods specified 
     in the Rules.

     Convertibility is not commutative, if the Rules specify that that N 
     Objects of Class X are Convertible into M Objects of Class Y, that 
     does not imply the reverse, that that M Objects of Class Y are 
     Convertible into N Objects of Class X.

{Comment: This allows the Rules to establish general methods of
          conversion, which don't have to be reversible.  The closest we 
          ever had was when it was possible to buy Marks or Reform 
          Coins.  This will be utilized in this reform in two ways, one, 
          to create a "universal" currency that can be converted to 
          other useful Objects (as a new player reward, Speaker's 
          Gratuity, Champion's award.) and to allow Blots to be used as 
          "Debt Tokens" (see next Rule.)}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Restricted Convertibility}

     Restricted Convertibility means that the Rules specify that N
     Objects of Class X are Convertible into M Objects of Class Y, and
     either N or M is a negative integer.  Restricted conversions only
     take place when required by this Rule, and only proceed as
     described in this Rule.  This Rule takes precedence over all other
     Rules governing Convertibility.

     When N Objects of Class X are converted into -(M) Objects of Class
     Y (N and M being positive non-zero integers and X and Y being
     different Classes of Objects), N Objects of Class X owned by a
     specific entity are Destroyed, and simultaneously M Objects of
     Class Y are Destroyed in the possession of the same entity. This
     Conversion is only allowed if the entity doing the conversion
     possesses M or more Objects of Class Y.  In this Case, N Objects
     of Class X can be said to be Inversely Convertible into M Objects
     of Class Y.
     
     When -(N) Objects of Class X are converted into M Objects of Class
     Y (N and M being positive non-zero integers and X and Y being
     different Classes of Objects), N Objects of Class X owned by a
     specific entity are Created, and simultaneously M Objects of
     Class Y are Created in the possession of the same entity. This
     Conversion is only permitted to be done by the Recordkeepor of an
     Object, and only in the case when the Rules require eim to Transfer
     or Destroy an Object that an entity does not possess.  This is done
     only as described in other Rules. In this Case, N Objects of Class
     X can be said to be Negatively Convertible into M Objects of Class
     Y.

{Comment: It might not be directly obvious, but this handles the cases
          of Indulgences and Blots, Blots coming into being when the 
          attempt is made to (to use obsolete terminology) make a 
          Treasury go negative, while when an Indulgence is Converted, 
          it destroys itself and a Blot.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Equivalence of Objects}

     The Rules can specify that a certain number of Objects of one Class 
     are Equivalent to a certain number of Objects of another Class. 
     Objects in one of these Classes are said to be Equivalent to
     Objects in the other Class.

     Equivalency means that if the Rules specify that N Objects of Class 
     X are Equivalent to M Objects of Class Y (Where N and M are two 
     non-zero Integers and X and Y are two different Classes of Objects.  
     In this case the Objects in Classes X and Y are Equivalent to each 
     other.), then any entity that owns N Objects of Class X may Convert 
     those Objects into M Objects of Class Y, and any entity that owns M 
     Objects of Class Y may Convert those Objects into N Objects of 
     Class X. (Equivalency implies Convertibility, but not vice versa.)

     Entities may only Convert Equivalent Objects by methods specified 
     in the Rules.
     
     In addition, Equivalent Objects may always be substituted for each 
     other as follows;  If the Rules specify that N Objects of Class X 
     are Equivalent to M Objects of Class Y, then wherever any Rule 
     specifies a value of "N Objects of Class X," that value may be 
     substituted by "M Objects of Class Y" (and vice versa) without 
     changing the meaning or interpretation of that Rule.  Equivalency 
     means the two values are synonymous.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that specifies any value 
     in Objects that has Equivalency to other Objects.

{Comment:  This allows objects to be "equal" in some circumstances.  It
           is used later in the definition of Decimal Objects, allowing 
           smaller Objects that are "worth" 1/10 of another type of 
           Object.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Multiples of Convertible or Equivalent Objects}

     If the Rules specify that N Objects of Class X are Convertible to M 
     Objects of Class Y (Where N and M are two non-zero Integers and X 
     and Y are two different Classes of Objects.), this also implies 
     that A*N Objects of Class X are Convertible to A*M Objects of Class 
     Y for all positive integral values of A.

     If the Rules specify that N Objects of Class X are Equivalent to M 
     Objects of Class Y (Where N and M are two non-zero Integers and X 
     and Y are two different Classes of Objects.), this also implies 
     that A*N Objects of Class X are Equivalent to A*M Objects of Class 
     Y for all integral values of A.

{Comment: While this seems intuitively obvious given the prior
          definitions, since we're dealing with integral values here, it 
          doesn't hurt to be explicit.}


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) has its title change from "Currency Recordkeepors"
to "Object Records"


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) is amended to read as follows;

     Every Recordkeepor of a given Class of Objects must, once a week, 
     publish a report that contains a list of all entities that own 
     Objects belonging to that Class, and the number of those Objects 
     each entity possesses. This record of ownership is known as the 
     "Actual State" of those Objects; entities only own Objects as 
     recorded by the Recordkeepor, and Objects exist only in those 
     numbers recorded by the Recordkeepor.

     There is also the "Legal State" of those Objects, which is the 
     record of ownership and number that reflects what the Recordkeepor
     would have recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Within the Class of Objects e records, the Recordkeepor must record 
     every change in ownership or number of Objects that is mandated in 
     the Rules, and e must refrain from recording any change in 
     ownership or number of Objects that is not mandated in the Rules.  
     Willful disregard of this provision is an "Abuse of 
     Responsibility," a Crime defined in other Rules.

     If any Player believes that the Recordkeepor has produced a report 
     that states an Actual State for an Object (or set of Objects) which 
     is not also the Legal State for that Object (or set of Objects), e 
     may produce a Claim of Error alleging this.

     Whenever a CFJ (or an admitted COE) finds that at some point the 
     Actual State of an Object (or set of Objects) was not also the 
     Legal State of that Object (or set of Objects) the Recordkeepor for 
     that Object (or set of Objects) must adjust eir records so that the 
     Actual State of those Objects conforms to the Legal State of those 
     Objects as specified in the CFJ (or admitted COE).

     Object Records can be Ratified. The effect of such Ratification is 
     to change the Legal State of the recorded Objects to conform to the 
     Actual State of those Objects.

{Comment: This is the heart of the pragmatic nature of this proposal.
          Like "ratification" this Rule makes a distinct effort to 
          separate what the Game State is, and what our Reports record.  
          This however goes further by creating a "Legal State" distinct 
          from the "Actual State," this is meant to be an analogue, as 
          closely as possible, to our officers moving physical tokens 
          around-- if the officer makes a mistake and gives someone an 
          Object, the Object is actually given, there is no chance for a 
          game state being indeterminate.  The gamestate's what the 
          reports say, period.  The "Legal State" exists to allow the 
          correction of errors, it exists as a model of what the 
          gamestate should be.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: When the Recordkeepor is not a Player}

     If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be a
     Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibility until a new
     Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
     applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
     Recordkeepor, then all Objects within that Class are destroyed and
     that Class of Object ceases to exist.  It is the Speaker's duty
     to report this change to eimself as Recordkeepor.

{Comment: Part of the old version of the prior rule that no longer
          seemed to fit there.}


Rule 1579 (Mintors) is repealed.
Rule 1722 (Minting of Currencies) is repealed.
Rule 1471 (Creation and Destruction of Currencies) is repealed.

{Comment: Mintors and Mint Authority are actually a hindrance to this
          reform, in that they add additional conditions to the legal 
          status of moves, and actually increase the bureaucratic 
          minutiae required to perform some basic actions, like 
          Converting an Object.  It also prevents the Object scheme from 
          addressing our "non-currency" Objects like Blots and Kudos.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Legal Changes to Objects}

     To have effect, whenever the Rules specify a Transfer, a Creation, 
     or Destruction, of an Object, they must also specify a Player who 
     is to send a message to that Object's Recordkeepor to notify em of 
     the change.  The change only happens if the following conditions 
     hold.

       i) The Rules mandate the change.
      ii) The Rules specify a Player to report the change to the 
          Recordkeepor.
     iii) The specified Player reports the change to the Recordkeepor.

     If all these conditions hold, then the change reported by the 
     Player becomes the Legal State of that Object.

{Comment: Note that this specifies the requirements to change the "Legal
          State" of an object. (see: Object Records)  Note that if the 
          above rule invalidates a move, and we discover it much later, 
          there's still no gamestate indeterminance, at worst the 
          Recordkeepor will have to revise eir records to conform the 
          Object Records to the Legal State of the game, but this would
          not invalidate any moves subsequent to the error.}


Rule 1721 (The Chancellor) is amended to read as follows;

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Class of
      Object, its Name and its Recordkeepor. This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

{Comment: MUQ's and Mintors no longer exist.}


Rule 1599 (Failure to Execute Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1598 (Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1596 (Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1732 (Satisfaction of Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1733 (Disputed Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1734 (Vacated Payment Orders) is repealed

{Comment: This repeals the Transfer Order/Payment Order bureaucracy,
          cutting down immensely on the paperwork required for simple
          actions.}

Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Transferring Objects}

     When an Object is Transferred it ceases to be owned by one entity, 
     and simultaneously becomes owned by another entity.

     An Object is Legally Transferred when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Transfer, reports the Transfer, the original
     owner of the Object, and the new owner of the Object, to that
     Object's Recordkeepor.  At this point the transfer is part of the
     Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Actually Transferred when the Recordkeepor for that 
     Object records the change in ownership for that Object.  At this 
     point the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Transfer with a 
     corresponding Actual Transfer.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     Transfers that correspond to no Legal Transfers, e is guilty of the 
     Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as defined in other Rules.

{Comment: The language here mirrors the language in Object Reports.
          Yes, theoretically the Recordkeepor could make all sorts
          of real transfers, but that is a criminalized act.  This,
          IMHO, is how "pragmatic" recordkeeping should be handled,
          W/O a mountain of paperwork.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Creation or Destruction of Objects}

     When an Object is Created it comes into existence owned by a 
     specific entity.  When an Object is Destroyed, some specific entity 
     with at least one of those Objects has one of those Objects cease 
     to exist.

     An Object is Legally Created when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Creation, reports the Creation, and the owner 
     of the Created Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At this 
     point the Creation is part of the Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Legally Destroyed when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Destruction, reports the Destruction, and the 
     owner of the Destroyed Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At 
     this point the Destruction is part of the Legal State of that 
     Object.

     An Object is Actually Created or Destroyed when the Recordkeepor 
     for that Object records the change for that Object.  At this point 
     the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Creation with a 
     corresponding Actual Creation.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Destruction with a 
     corresponding Actual Destruction.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     changes (Creations or Destructions) that correspond to no Legal
     changes, e is guilty of the Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as
     defined in other Rules.

{Comment: See comment above}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Conversion of Objects}

     When N Objects of Class X are converted into M Objects of Class Y 
     (N and M being integers and X and Y being different Classes of 
     Objects), N Objects of Class X owned by a specific entity are 
     Destroyed while simultaneously M Objects of Class Y are Created in 
     the possession of the same entity.

     The owner of a Convertible Object(s) can cause that Object to be 
     converted by reporting to the Recordkeepor of that Object: 

       i) That e is Converting his Object(s)
      ii) The Number and Class of Objects being Converted
     iii) and the Number and Class of the Objects e is Converting them
          to.

     If the specified Object and Number is Convertible into the 
     specified Object and Number, then the Conversion becomes part of 
     the Legal State of those Objects.

     When the Recordkeepor of an Object of Class X  receives the report 
     of a Legal Conversion of N Objects of Class X into M Objects of 
     Class Y (all in the possession of one entity) e must, as soon as
     possible, record the Actual Destruction of N Objects of Class X
     (possessed by that entity) and report the Legal Creation of M
     Objects of Class Y (in the possession of that entity) to the
     Recordkeepor of Objects of Class Y.

     The report of the Conversion of Object X is also the report of the 
     Destruction of Object X.

{Comment: This should be fairly straightforward given the prior rules.}


Rule 1713 (Debt) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever the Rules require that Objects be Transferred from an 
     entity, or that Objects possessed by an entity are to be 
     Destroyed, and upon the report of this Legal Transfer or Legal 
     Destruction, the entity possesses fewer Objects of the type
     specified then are required to be Transferred or Destroyed, 
     the Recordkeepor of that Object shall do the following before e
     makes the required Actual Transfers or Destructions:

      i) If the Objects being Transferred or Destroyed are Negatively 
         Convertible into Blots, e shall Convert -(M) of those Objects 
         into Blots possessed by the entity.  (Where M is the difference 
         between the number of those Objects the entity possesses and 
         the number of those Objects being Transferred or Destroyed.)

     ii) If the Objects being Transferred or Destroyed are not 
         Negatively Convertible into Blots, but are Equivalent to 
         Objects of Class Y that are, then e shall Convert -(N) Objects 
         of Class Y into Blots possessed by the entity. (where N is the 
         smallest value which will produce a number of Objects of Class 
         Y Equivalent to a number of the original Objects equal to or 
         greater than the difference between the number of those Objects 
         the entity possesses and the number of those Objects being 
         Transferred or Destroyed) Then e shall Convert all Objects of 
         Class Y that were Created into Objects of the original class.

    iii) If neither i) or ii) hold, e shall Create, in the possession of 
         the entity, (N) Blots and (N) of the Objects being Transferred 
         or Destroyed. (Where M is the difference between the number of 
         those Objects the entity possesses and the number of those 
         Objects being Transferred or Destroyed.)

     The Recordkeepor for the Object in question is charged with 
     reporting these changes to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

{Comment: There is no such thing as Persistent Indebtedness anymore.  If
          you go into debt, you get a Blot for each Object you're short.
          Blots become a sort of "negative Object."}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Transferable Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Transferable.  A 
     Transferable Object shall be Transferred whenever an owner of such 
     an Object wishes that Object to be Transferred to another entity 
     that is permitted to own that Object.  The owner of that Object 
     shall report this Transfer to the Recordkeepor of that Object.

{Comment: A basic Rule to cover transfers between Players.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Decimal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Decimal.  For 
     every Class of Decimal Objects X defined in the Rules there is also 
     another Class of Objects called deci-X, where X is the name of the 
     Class of Decimal Objects.

     One Object of Class X is Equivalent to ten Objects of Class deci-X.  
     It is permissible to record combined values of X Objects and deci-X 
     Objects in decimal notation. (i.e. saying "2.5 Objects of Class X" 
     is synonymous with saying "2 Objects of Class X and 5 Objects of 
     Class deci-X."

     The Recordkeepor for deci-X Objects is the same as the Recordkeepor 
     for X Objects.  If X Objects are Transferable, deci-X Objects are
     also Transferable.  If X Objects are Negatively Convertible into
     Blots, deci-X Objects are not.

{Comment: Allows a scheme for "fractional" objects w/o having them
          actually divisible.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Personal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Personal.  
     Personal Objects are only permitted to remain in the possession of 
     Players or the Bank.  If a Personal Object is in the possession of 
     a non-Player entity, then the Recordkeepor of that Object must 
     immediately transfer that Object to the non-Player Entity's 
     Executor if such exists.  If no such Executor exists, then e must 
     Transfer the Object to the Bank.

     The Recorkeepor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     changes.

{Comment: There are a number of Objects that we want to restrict to 
          Players. Blots and Kudos being two that come to mind right 
          now.  If we ever re-introduce something like Win Tokens, they 
          should be Personal as well. Note, this is not an automagical
          process, a Blot could exist in a Group treasury, but it would
          be illegal for the Herald to let it stay there.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Objects Changed by Proposal}

     If a Proposal directly orders changes to any Objects, and does not 
     itself specify a Player to report those changes to the 
     Recordkeepors of those Objects, then the Assessor shall report 
     those changes.

{Comment: Prevents a potential conflict with some prior Rules.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Reporting Object Changes, Timing}

     Whenever the Rules require a Player to report a change in an Object 
     to that Object's Recordkeepor, that Player shall make eir Report of 
     the change as soon as possible after the Rules require em to do so.

     Whenever a Recordkeepor of an Object receives a report in the 
     change of an Object, and that report caused a change in the Legal 
     State of that Object, e must then make the corresponding change in 
     the Actual State of that Object as soon as possible after receiving 
     the report.

{Comment: Fine point here, a change can be a Legal Change if never
          received by the Recordkeepor, but if so, e's not bound by the
          ASAP clause to make the Actual Change until a COE or CFJ finds
          the omission.}

==============================================================
Part II: Probate


Rule 1601 (Probate) is amended to read as follows;

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any Objects;
      if an entity which possesses any Objects would otherwise be
      destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate, and its
      destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate."

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses any Objects.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.


Rule 1637 (Wills) is amended to read as follows;

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity with which it is
      associated, and how the Transferable Objects possessed by that
      entity and its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs
      when that entity becomes a terminal estate in Probate.

      When a entity's Will is executed, the Executor in Probate of that
      entity will, as soon as possible, report all Transfers required by
      the Will to the appropriate Recordkeepors, excepting those
      Transfers which specify Objects that the entity does not possess.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.


Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
     Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
     that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
     appointment in the Public Forum.

     The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
     entity, and empowered only to report Transfers of Objects
     possessed by that entity.
      
     The Executor in Probate must do the following upon eir nomination, 
     in the order given, and perform no other acts on behalf of the 
     terminal estate e represents.  E must not initiate a step until the 
     prior one is complete:

       i) The Executor in Probate must first report to the Herald the 
          destruction of all Blots possessed by the terminal estate e 
          represents. E must do so as soon as possible.  This step shall 
          be complete only when all Blots possessed by the terminal
          estate are Actually Destroyed by the Herald or, if the 
          terminal estate possesses no Blots, this step shall be
          completed immediately.

      ii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report all Transfers of Transferable Objects possessed by
          the terminal estate as required by that entity's Will.  This
          step shall be complete only when all Transfers required by the 
          Will are Actually made by the appropriate Recordkeepors, or, 
          if no such Transfers are Required, or no Will exists, this 
          step shall be completed immediately.

     iii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report the Transfer of all remaining Objects (if any) in 
          that entity's possession to the Bank. This step shall be 
          complete only when all such Transfers are Actually made by the 
          appropriate Recordkeepors, or, if no Objects remain in the 
          possession of the terminal estate, this step shall be 
          completed immediately.

      iv) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must announce, in the Public Forum, that the terminal estate
          has left Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the above steps,
      that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e announces that
      e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

{Comments: This streamlines the whole Probate process, eliminating the
           overhead created by allowing debt in such a small economy.}


Rule 1739 (The Probate Code) is repealed

{Comment: Without TOs or POs, there's no Debt as such, and no such thing
          as a creditor or a debtor.  Therefore, most of this Rule's 
          function is subsumed by the above Rule.}

============================================================
Part III: The Bank


Rule 1470 (The Bank) is amended to read as follows;

     There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank is
     permitted to possess any Object.  This Rule takes prcidence over 
     any Rule that would forbid the Bank from owning an object.

{Comment: No such thing as mint authority.}


Rule 1735 (The Chancellor as Bank's Executor) is repealed.

{Comment: having the Chancellor as an interface between the Officers and
     the bank IMHO is a needless level of complication.  Better to give 
     the individual Recordkeepors the power to manipulate Objects.


Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") is amended to
read as follows;

     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some number of
     Objects to some entity, that Player shall report, to the
     appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of those Objects from the
     Bank to that entity for the number specified. This is synonymous
     with the case when the Rules specify that a Player report an entity 
     receives or gains the specified number of Objects.

     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill an entity for some
     number of Objects, that Player shall report, to the appropriate
     Recordkeepor, a Transfer of Objects from that entity to the Bank
     for the number specified. This is synonymous with the case when the
     Rules specify that a Player report an entity is penalized or loses 
     the specified number of Objects.

===========================================================
Part IV: (ex-)Currencies

Rule 1701 (Proposal Notes) is amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects known as Proposal Notes (P-Notes) and 
     their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.  The Promotor has the duty to 
     publish, at least once a week in the Public Forum, a report of the 
     number of P-Notes owned by each entity that possesses P-Notes, and 
     a list of all the changes in P-Note holdings since the last such 
     report with the reason for those changes.

     The Class of Proposal Notes is Decimal and Transferable.


Rule 1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals) is amended to read as follows;

      All Proposals have associated with them a Petition fee.  The
      Petition fee for any Proposal is one P-Note, unless another Rule
      specifies a higher fee.  This rule takes precedence over any
      Rule that would require a lower fee, no fee, or a fee paid in
      Objects other than P-Notes.

      The Petition Fee for a Proposal is paid when an entity
      Transfers the amount of that Proposal's Petition Fee, provided
      that e indicates clearly that the Transfer is being made to pay 
      the Petition fee for that Proposal and e makes no other claim
      as to the purpouse of the Transfer.


Rule 1696 (Voting Tokens) is amended to read as follows;

      There is a Class of Objects known as Voting Tokens (VTs).
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Assessor.

      The Assessor's Report includes the number of VTs possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Assessor's Report.

      The Class of Voting Tokens is Decimal and Transferable.


Rule 1442 (Using VTs) is amended to read as follows;

     The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the Transfer
     of VTs to the Bank, as specified below.

     A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
     Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
     Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

     At the end of the Voting Period, the Assessor shall Transfer enough 
     Voting Tokens from the Voting Entity to pay for the last Vote (or 
     set of Votes) cast by that entity during the Voting Period.

     The Assessor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     Transfers.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: The Cimon}

     There exists a Class of Objects Known as Cimons. This Class of 
     Objects is Transferable.  Cimons are Convertible as follows:

       i) 1 Cimon is Convertible into 2 Voting Tokens
      ii) 1 Cimon is Convertible into 1 Proposal Note
     iii) 2 Cimons are Convertible into 1 Indulgence

     The Recordkeepor for Cimons is the Chancellor

{Comment: This is the "universal" Object I was talking about.}


Rule 1662 (The Speaker's Gratuity) is amended to read as follows;

      At the end of every month, if the same Player was Speaker for
      that entire month, the Registrar shall pay out a Speaker's
      Gratuity of one Cimon to the Speaker.

{Comment: One of the places I thought the Cimon might be useful.}


Rule 1465 (Champion's Reward) is amended to read as follows;

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player.  At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward,
      the Assessor shall pay out five Cimons to that Player.

{Comment: One of the places I thought the Cimon might be useful.}

===========================================================
Part V: Blots & Indulgences


Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate) is
amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects named Indulgences, which is 
     Transferable.  There is also a Class of Objects named Blots, which 
     is Personal and not Transferable.  The Recordkeepor for both Blots 
     and Indulgences is the Herald.

     One Indulgence is Inversely Convertible into one Blot.

     A Player who owns no Blots is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing 
     condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

{Comment: The language fell out neatly given the prior Rules, and 
          finally, after having its status reduced to first a negative 
          value of a "real" currency, then to a Payment Order, a Blot 
          regains its status as an entity in its own right.;) }


Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) is amended to read as follows;

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, among all
      Players, randomly distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the 
      number of Blots Actually Created in the past Week : for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and Create
      an Indulgence in the posession of that Player.  The Herald is
      charged with detecting and reporting these changes.


Rule 1437 (Fugitives from Justice) is amended to read as follows;

     When an Executor in Probate reports the Legal Destruction of Blots 
     belonging to the terminal estate of a deregistered Player, the 
     Herald shall assign the person who was that player a value of 
     Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots the Herald Destroyed.  
     That person becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  Herald shall keep a 
     record of the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive 
     from Justice.

     At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
     value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
     rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
     number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
     one by this method.

     When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
     Create in eir possession a number of Blots equal in number to
     the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
     reregistration.  Players shall not have Fugitive Blots.

{Comment: Changed a few things to make clear that Fugitive Blots aren't
          an Object, nor do Players possess them.}
