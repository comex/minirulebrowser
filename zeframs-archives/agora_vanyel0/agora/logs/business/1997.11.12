I hereby CFJ on the following statement:

     "Immediately after becoming Speaker, Morendil was registered as a player."

Caller's arguments:

As Zefram has pointed out, "A player is anyone who is registered as a player"
may (especially with game custom backing it) be interpreted as making "player"
and "person who is registered as a player" synonymous.

I write to urge undecided voters to vote for me in the Speaker-Elect
election.  I believe this is a good idea because:
  i)  I'm well qualified, having played the game since its beginning
  ii) I'm not a member of the Threat group, which, in the event of
      Steve's election to the position of S-E, would come to control
      two and possibly three places in the Appelate Court.  
  
As far as the Appelate duties of the Speaker are concerned, I believe
my record there as CotC is a good one.  I was last Clerk for a period
of 15 months, handling over 60 CFJs, and was on the Appelate panel for
11 of 12 appeals in that period.

Of course, the Speaker is also required to stand in for all other
Officers, should the need arise, and I believe that I am at least as
well qualified as any other candidate to do this, having played for
long enough to have seen most positions from the inside.

Unprompted election manifestos to order,
Michael.

H. Assessor, Herald and Registrar (possibly other officers, but I
don't think so), please note that this message contains some work for
you (sorry!).

It's a bit strange to be appelate judge on CFJ 1068 and one of those
inactive EiPs at the same time, so I'd like to get things going.

1. I've tried to make an assessment of the currency holdings in Elde's estate, but as
far as I'm aware these are zero at the moment, and there are no
outstainding POs naming Elde as payor, now all the old blots have been
vacated. Any recordkeepors who have differing information are kindly
requested to let me know.

2. Based on this assumption I hereby announce that I intend to
terminate Elde's estate in a timely manner, i.e. soon, but that I'd
like to wait for some more days to see if anyone has any open claims
against this estate.

3. While I'm waiting I would like to have some fun with my
executorship as long as I can:

As Elde's EiP I hereby register Elde as a player of Agora.

As Elde's EiP I hereby declare presence on P3585.

I haven't yet made up my mind on this CFJ, but I think it will be
important to decide how "timely" is to be interpreted in this
particular case, especially as far as the execution of Antimatter's
estate is concerned.

I do not have the necessary information, so I would request evidence
from everyone who can help concerning possible reasons why the
execution of Antimatter's estate took as long as it did (at least from
10 September (Antimatter's deregistration) to 4 November (date of CFJ
1068)). 

I would especially ask the players and officers involved, Harlequin
and Antimatter as well as the notary at the time, or recordkeepors who
remember anything, to provide me with info concerning dates (assignment
of Harlequin as EiP etc) and info about POs involvong Antimatter that
may have been disputed during the time this CFJ referes to.

I would like to add the remark that, at least for me, this CFJ
requires a new type of judicial work - I cannot decide this just
looking at the rules, like I could for many CFJs concerning the
interpretation of rules, or based on just one or two officers' reports
and/or messages to the PF, as has often been the case before.

I hereby specify that I cast no votes on Proposal 3591.  This action
cancels my previous votes cast and cancels my delayed transfer orders, each
for 1 VT for these two votes.  This action is not prohibited by R1717,
because I am not changing my vote, I am cancelling it.

I hereby cancel any delayed transfer orders that are waiting to be executed
naming myself as the payor and the bank as the payee which exist for the

I hereby cast two votes FOR Proposal 3591.

I'd like to note that I still receive my two VTs as per Rule 1717.

Let me try this one more time:

I hereby move to the origin and go off hold.

I hereby specify that I cast no votes on Proposal 3591.  This action
cancels my previous votes cast and cancels my delayed transfer orders, each
for 1 VT for these two votes.  This action is not prohibited by R1717,
because I am not changing my vote, I am cancelling it.

I hereby cancel any delayed transfer orders that are waiting to be executed
naming myself as the payor and the bank as the payee which exist for the
purpose of casting votes on Proposal 3591.

I hereby cast two votes FOR Proposal 3591.

I hereby move to the Stasis Chamber and go on hold.

I'd like to note that I still receive my two VTs as per Rule 1717.

I believe 3585 is flawed, and others have noted that it is more likely to
fail due to Quorum than due to F/A. Therefore, I hereby cancel my Vote on
Proposal 3585.

Greetings,

I note that Morendil was deregistered for Lawlessness on October 14, therefore
this attempt is without legal effect.  You will have to wait till after

Claim admitted.  I will use the previously described method of recalculating
the distribution by drawing another 17 random numbers between 0 and 16
inclusive.  Whenever the number 16 comes up, the corresponding Indulgence PO
will be vacated and a new one issued to Morendil...

(set! *random-state* (make-random-state #t))
;Value 6: #[random-state 6]

(random 17)
;Value: 9

(random 17)
;Value: 5

(random 17)
;Value: 16

(random 17)
;Value: 9

(random 17)

So, the third Indulgence distribution is switched from Swann to Morendil.

If I have not already done so,
I hereby vacate POI277 and order the Bank to pay one Indulgence to Morendil.

To the best of my knowledge, no Indulgence or P-Note POs with Antimatter as
payor or payee have ever been in dispute (other than the blanket dispute over
the existence of Payment Orders in general, which was resolved well before 10
September).

H. CotC elJefe,

I hereby make the following CFJ, barring Morendil:

Rule 1558 prevents a Player who is the Speaker from nominating in an
Election for the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Relevant Rules: 1558, 1647

Argument:

I'll take the unusual step of presenting arguments for both sides. I'm
not really advocating any particular Judgement. I just think the matter
should be resolved one way or the other. I'll leave it to the Judge
to decide which e prefers. Perhaps the Judge will find some new
argument which I haven't thought of to resolve the matter.

R1647 states:

      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

while R1558 states:

      No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
      the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

On the side of a Judgement of TRUE, we have the observation that
if a Player who is the Speaker were still to be Speaker when e
was Elected Speaker-Elected, e would not be permitted to hold the
Office, even temporarily. This seems to show that the Speaker
cannot nominate for Speaker-Elect.

On the other hand, however, how can we be sure that the Player
who is Speaker would still be Speaker when the Election for the
Office of Speaker-Elect concluded? If the Player had somehow
ceased to be Speaker, nothing would prevent em from holding the
Office of Speaker-Elect, were e to win the Election. And it is not
difficult to imagine ways in which the a Player who is the Speaker
might cease to be Speaker in time take up the Office of Speaker-Elect.
Here are three:

1. By proposal. From the call for Nominations to the announcement of
the results, an Election in which there are multiple Candidates takes
at least two weeks to complete. In that time, a high-Powered Rule
might be be adopted removing the Player from the position of Speaker. 

2. By giving up the Speakership voluntarily. Although R681 prevents
a Speaker who gives up the Speakership voluntarily from nominating
emself for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Rule does not say that
the Speaker may not already be nominated at the time e gives up
the Speakership.

3. By going On Hold. Eir doing so would constitute the Crime of
Speaker Inactivity (see R1375), with the quite heavy penalties
entailed by this, but that would not make em ineligible to hold the
Office of Speaker-Elect.

Whether the Judge finds these latter considerations persuasive will
largely depend on how e chooses to construct the phrase 'would not
be permitted to hold the Office'. If e chooses to read it 'would 
*certainly* not be permitted to hold the Office', then I think a
Judgement of FALSE is indicated, since I think I've shown above
that we cannot be certain that a Player who is the Speaker would
not be permitted to hold the Office of Speaker-Elect were e Elected
to that Office. On the other hand, if e chooses to read it as 'would
not be permitted to hold the Office, other things being equal' then
a Judgement of TRUE is indicated, since all of the possibilites I've
raised fall into the category of other things not being equal.

Requested Injunction:

In case of a Judgement of TRUE, I request that the Judge issue
an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate R1558 with
a copy of the Statement and the list of Relevant Rules.
