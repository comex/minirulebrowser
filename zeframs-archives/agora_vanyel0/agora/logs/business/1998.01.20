I seem to remember that my first announcement of this plan wasn't
valid for some formal reason. So I'll try again:

I hereby announce the following plan for the termination of
Calabresi's estate:

1. Creditors: C owes 2 indulgences to the bank (POI575 and 578). These
POs are to be satisfied.

2. There is no will.

3. Transfer the remaining 10 indulgences and 14.5 VTs to the bank.

Welcome on board, Time Agent and Sherlock!

Although we are talking about introducing real VT scarcity (and I do
support this) I still remember being given some currency by older
players when I once joined a MUD. I never got the hang of mudding, but
did appreciate the gesture. Now I have more VTs than I need, so I'd
hereby (H. assessor, please note!) transfer 5 VTs to Time Agent and 5
Vts to Sherlock as a kind of welcome gift (not, to make that clear, as
a bribe... the only thing I could think of at the moment is bribe you
into some Internomic participation, but that's fun anyway, so it
doesn't need bribes as an incentive).

>>
I have to note, again, that Calabresi's estate is not terminal...
<<

Ah yes, that was it. So I'll try a third time:

I hereby announce the following plan for termination of Calabresi's
estate: 

  C owes 2 indulgences to the bank (POI575 and 578). These
  POs are to be satisfied.

That's all, I guess. did I get it right this time? 

Another question: I don't see why Calabresi would cease to be in
Probate after I implement this plan. Does he or doesn't he? If he
doesn't, I'll remain his trustee, doing nothing, I assume. Or
resign...

Vir's Probate

Vir has no debts or credits, based on the latest reports.  As far as I can
tell, Vir is not a terminal estate and therefore there is nothing that I can
do.  Therefore my plan for Vir's probate is to do nothing.  If no one objects,
after seven days I will implement this plan.  8)

I object to this plan on the grounds that it would fail to fully
dispose of Calabresi's estate.  (You should note that Morendil did not
actually object to your plan, since his objection was not posted to
the Public Forum.  I believe his oversight in this regard was
intentional.)

Claim admitted.  The appropriate line in the report should have read:

Yes, this does seem to be a "Catch 22".  Let's get this fixed.  In the
meantime, I hereby resign as Vir's Trustee.

R-O-M Submission

This week, based on the latest Ruleset that I have (dated 1/16/98), there were
still 290 Rules.  My random number generator spit out the following:

199 = R1733 Disputed Payment Orders
 44 = R1555 Retirement and Removal from Offices
253 = R1592 Authority of SLCs to Change Properties
227 = R1697 Multiple Rapid Wins
174 = R651  Heroes

Well, the first three are a bit too useful to get rid of, and the last is a bit
sacrosanct.  After all, Peter Suber is our Hero.  That leaves R1697.  Rather
fitting for me to select this one.  8)

Actually, I never liked this solution, anyway.  I think rapid multiple wins
should be allowed if a Player can find a loophole that permits it.  IMO, the
solution should be to plug the loophole rather than just prevent multiple wins.

So, R1697 is the R-O-M selection for this week.  If anyone wants to sponsor it,
please refer to it by the number 3680 or by the name "Repeal Rule 1697".
