[Proposal 3741, "Plots", was partly broken by the prior adoption of
 Proposal 3740, "Repeal Locations".  This Proposal, if adopted, will
 repair the damage.]

Proposal:  Plot Repair

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with this text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially
owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name
Without
      Objection.

Create a Rule entitled "Adjacency" with this text:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.
Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to
9:

  * If a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the
    Longitude for "Y") already exists, its Latitude and Longitude are set to
    X and Y, respectively.
  * If no such Plot exists, then a Plot with that name, Latitude and
Longitude
    is created.

Create a Rule entitled "The Cartographor" with this text:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures
since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the
last
            Report




I spend 1 P-Note to raise this Proposal's Priority to 1.

According to the latest reports for VTs (Accountor), P-Notes (Promotor)
and Indulgences (Herald), Time Agent possesses 0.5 VTs and is the Payor
of the following Payment Orders:

  VT1932 (2.0 VTs to Bank)
  VT1987 (2.0 VTs to Bank)
  POI778 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI785 (3 Indulgences to Bank)
  POI787 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI789 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI790 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI796 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI797 (1 Indulgence to Bank)

Furthermore, I interpret the following message from Harlequin:

> Brrr. No irises. NOOOOOOOO IRISESSSSSSSS.

as meaning that Time Agent possesses no Irises or Iris debts.  (Yes, I know
the
message was a reply to Jester's Probate, and may have been intended to apply
solely to Jester.  However, I will probably deKudo anyone who insists on
arguing
the point further, unless it's Harlequin emself.)


I submit the following plan for the completion of Time Agent's Probate:

  * Transfer 0.5 VTs from Time Agent to the Bank
  * Vacate Payment Orders VT1932 and VT1987
  * Vacate Payment Orders POI778, POI785, POI787, POI789, POI790,
      POI796, and POI797

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1093

  Player Morendil did not commit the Infraction of Inciting to Riot.

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

I hold that one commits the Infraction of Inciting to Riot by failing
to become Abiding within a month of last becoming Rebellious.
Further, at any given time it is easy to determine whether or not
someone has committed the Infraction: we ask "Are they rebellious, and
have they been so for the last month or more?"  This is clearly the
easiest and most sensible reading of the rule as it will come to
operate in the months after its passage.  This case is only
interesting because it involves a Player who became Rebellious before
the passage of the Proposal defining the Infraction.

Further support to this view comes from Real World practice when
similar laws are enacted.  For example, in Britain the gun laws were
recently tightened to make it illegal to posses various forms of
hand-gun.  This legislation could have been phrased so as to instantly
make criminals of all those who had been holding guns that had been
legal up to this point.  Rather than do something so unfair, the
Government allowed for an Amnesty Period.  In not doing something
similar in Agora, the proposal creating the Rule defining the
Infraction of Inciting to Riot has made instant "criminals" of
Morendil and Harlequin.

The Caller makes two further claims.  Firstly he claims that Rule 1513
"Authority of non-rule entities" exempts him from being subject to the
Infraction as the rule was not available to him at the time when he
became Rebellious.  This is suspect for two reasons.  The first is
that there is a strong case that R1513 does not restrict the power of
the rules when its third paragraph states "No Nomic Entity is
permitted to require...."  The whole scope of the rule in question is
non-rule entities, so to suppose that this third paragraph is now
talking about the rules as well as the non-rule entities it has been
talking about hitherto is suspect.

Secondly, the claim that R1513 prevents the Infraction from being
applied is countered by the fact that Morendil did have the text of
the putative rule available to him before he became liable to the
Infraction.  This is because the rule was necessarily published in
proposal form before becoming a rule.  The fact that this text was not
available to him when he Rebelled is irrelevant as he committed the
Infraction on failing to become Abiding a month later.

The final argument presented by the Caller is that Morendil is not
liable to the Infraction because at the time of the detection and
reporting of the Infraction he had become Abiding, and thus performed
the duty required of him.  This argument is akin to claiming that
eventually submitting a late judgement for a CFJ exempts one from the
penalty for late judgement if that Infraction has not yet been
detected and reported.  We well know that Agoran practice, custom and
law does not suport this view.  At the time of the passage of the
proposal establishing the Infraction, Morendil instantaneously
committed it.  That this was only detected and reported after Morendil
had attempted become Abiding is irrelevant.

Where is my brain?  Time Agent is no longer a Player and should not be included
in this list, and should not receive an Indulgence.  This is a Claim of Error
which I admit.  The above PO to Time Agent is hereby vacated.  A new random
number was selected, and a new PO issued as follows:

The Bank is hereby ordered to pay one Indulgence to Michael.

I claim that the above Payment Orders were improperly issued, as R1788
(VT unemployment benefits) was repealed by P3741. This is a COE.

H. Scorekeepor,

If I have not already done so, I note that Swann loses 2 points and Chuck loses
4 points as a result of the above Blot gains.

Batch Size

Well, proposal making has heated up a bit, and I see a hint from Steve that e
would like a larger Batch Size.  We saw some real horse trading going on with
the size of 2, so I am reluctant to increase it.  But I'll compromise a bit and
see what happens - I hereby change the Batch Size to 3.

PROTO: The Ombudsman

I thought it might be time for this.  I think that, with the tremendous
shift of power to the Officers, there might be some need to have someone
to act as the voice of the common folk.  I also think the Ombudsman's
job will be somewhat interesting, since it would be one of the most
broadly defined official positions in Agora.  I think there can be more
for this guy to do, but at the moment I think this is enough of a start.

================
Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman)

     There is a Patent Title of Ombudsman.  This title shall be awarded 
     in the following ways;

       i) If the prior Ombudsman designates an eligible successor, then 
          the player designated by the Ombudsman is awarded the title.

      ii) If a referendum is called to award the title to an eligible 
          player, then upon the passage of that referendum the title is 
          awarded to that player.

     iii) If no Ombudsman exists, then the Speaker shall, in the Public 
          Forum, call for volunteers from amongst all eligible players.  
          One week from this call, the speaker shall select at random a 
          new Ombudsman from all eligible players who volunteered.

     Whenever a player is awarded the title of Ombudsman, that title is 
     removed from all prior holders.

     The player holding the title of Ombudsman shall be known as the 
     Ombudsman.

     If an Ombudsman ceases to be a Player, then eir title is removed.


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Elgibility to be Ombudsman)

     In order to be eligible to be the Ombudsman, the following must be 
     true of a Player;

       i) The Player must hold no Office or be the Speaker.
      ii) The Player must not be On Hold.
     iii) The Player must not be Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group.
      iv) The Player has no Blots.

     If any of these conditions becomes false of any Ombudsman, that 
     Player has a period of 14 days to either change the situation or 
     designate a willing successor in the Public Forum. If the Ombudsman
     fails to do either within the 14 day period, then the Title of 
     Ombudsman is immediately removed from that Player.


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Designating a Successor Ombudsman)

     At any time, an Ombudsman is permitted to designate an eligible 
     player to succeed him as Ombudsman.  E must do this in the Public 
     Forum.  To be successful, this designation must be of a willing 
     player.

     If a successor is designated, and that Player is eligible to be the 
     Ombudsman, and that Player consents to be the Ombudsman in the 
     Public Forum within three days of the designation, then that Player 
     is awarded the title of Ombudsman either upon the designation, or 
     upon eir consent, whichever is later.


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Referendum to replace the Ombudsman)

     Any Player can call for a referendum to replace the Ombudsman.  The 
     Player must make this call in the Public Forum, and the Referendum 
     must name an eligible Player to replace the current Ombudsman.  For 
     the referendum to begin, the named Player must consent in the 
     Public Forum within the two days immediately after the call.  If 
     the named Player consents, then the voting period begins as of the 
     consent.

     The default procedure for referenda changes as follows;  Vote 
     collector is the Player who called for the referendum.  Voting 
     entities only include players who hold no Office and are not the 
     Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group, and who are not the
     Speaker.

     If the referendum passes, the named player becomes Ombudsman, if it 
     fails, the referendum has no effect.


Let the following rule be crated;
(Title: Duties and Responsibilities of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman is responsible for being the voice of the people of 
     Agora.  His duties, broadly defined, are as follows;

       i) To help new Players acclimate to Agora by providing mentoring
          and guidance.
      ii) To hear grievances by the Players and bring them to the 
          attention of Officers and the Speaker.
     iii) To fight injustice insofar as the powers of the Ombudsman 
          allow.
      iv) To be an impartial representative for all the Players of 
          Agora.

     Other Rules shall define the specifics of these duties and 
     responsibilities.


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Grievance Report)

     The Ombudsman has the responsibility to hear confidential 
     grievances from any Player about the game of Agora. The Ombudsman 
     shall regularly poll the people of Agora, with special attention to 
     those Players who hold no Office, and solicit their grievances.  In 
     addition, any Player with a grievance can submit their grievances 
     to the Ombudsman without being polled.  These grievances need not 
     be matters of law (which are subjects of the courts) but can be 
     manners of style, culture, fairness, and anything else that affects 
     a Player's ability to participate in Agora and enjoy doing so.

     Every week, the Ombudsman shall publish an Official Grievance 
     Report listing grievances e has received since the last such 
     report.  This report shall not give out the names of the Players 
     with these grievances unless the Player with the grievance 
     explicitly states that eir name is to be attached to the report, 
     otherwise all grievances given to the Ombudsman shall be 
     confidential and shall never be revealed.  This rule takes 
     precedence over any rule that would require or permit the Ombudsman 
     to violate this confidentiality.


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Duty to New and Inexperienced Players)

     Upon the registration of any new Player the Ombudsman shall 
     communicate to that Player, as soon as possible, the fact that the 
     Ombudsman exists to be a mentor to that Player.  The Ombudsman 
     shall also provide the following services to any Player.

       i) To the best of eir ability answer any question about Agora. 
      ii) To assist any player in understanding the mechanics of a given 
          action (submitting/judging a CFJ, submitting a Proposal, 
          manipulating currency, and so on.)
     iii) To direct a player's query to the appropriate Officer. (Such 
          as FOIA requests and so on.)
      iv) Provide advice to any player who needs it.


Let the following rule be crated;
(Title: Special Privileges of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman shall have the following rights and privileges, to be 
     exercised only in the spirit of advocacy for *all* Agorans;

       i) Once every month, the Ombudsman is permitted and empowered to 
          vacate all the Blots on a single individual Player.  This must 
          only be done to correct what the Ombudsman believes to be an 
          injustice to an otherwise Rule-abiding Player.

      ii) The Ombudsman is permitted to cast an additional two votes 
          AGAINST any proposal e believes disenfranchises a large number 
          of Players,  distributes power unfairly, or adversely affects 
          a large class of Players who do not themselves have the 
          resources to oppose.

     iii) The Ombudsman has the power to, once a week, pay out one of 
          any currency minted by the Bank to any single Player who has 
          none of that currency.

      iv) If the Ombudsman Rebels, e counts as three players toward a
          Revolt.

     In addition, the Ombudsman shall receive a weekly stipend equal to 
     1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary, to be paid out by the 
     Registrar.
