This Week with R-O-M

For the current 342 Rules, the following five number were selected:

 14 = Rule 1688 Power
331 = Rule 1378 Kudo Transfers
138 = Rule 1802 Vacation of Orders
148 = Rule 1562 Excess CFJs
120 = Rule 1786 Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of Margins

Nothing exciting, this week (except for getting rid of Power, which no one
(few?) will go for 8)).  I'll stick with my fall-back tendency to select Rules
that get rid of penalties.  So the selection this week is Rule 1562.

Acting on behalf of and as Executor of the Repeal-O-Matic, I submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1562 (Excess CFJs)
          This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
          Rule 1562 is hereby Repealed.

This was 2 VTs that the Bank owed Swann, not the other way around.  H.
Chancellor take note, R1754 imposes an obligation on you to transfer these 2
VTs back to Swann.

I have nothing to add to the arguments that have already been posted in the
discussions related to this CFJ.  I find no flaws in the argument presented by
the original Judge, Michael, and therefore, I vote to Sustain this Judgement.

Morendil has violated Rule 1647, vis:

Rule 1647/2 (Power=1)
Office of the Speaker-Elect

      Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has
      the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.
      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

      The CotC and Justiciar may not Nominate for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a
      Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker(or for any
      other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of
      Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as
      Arbiter of Succession.

      The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Whether or not this makes eir Nomination invalid is open to debate.
