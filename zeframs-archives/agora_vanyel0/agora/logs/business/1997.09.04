I protoed this some time ago, and I'll take your silence as at least
some form of agreement with the idea, so I'd like to make the
following IN proposal (H. Ambassador, take note - maybe you can
forward my remarks to IN, as well. Thanks!):

--------
Create a new rule with the text enclosed in ###:

###
InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal. 

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote. 

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.

###

Remarks: 

- Note that 309 (voting period ends before the full two weeks'
time if all nomics have voted) cannot stop InterNomic from voting. In
fact, at the moment, with InterNomic eligible to vote but not doing
so, the second sentence of 309 never applies at all.

- The last two paragraphs are needed because 332 does not make it
clear who will actually cast a valid vote (= "send a message to the
moderator" according to 207) for InterNomic.

- Note that the moderator is not "voting for" IN in any sense; it's
just that someone has to do it, and the moderator is the only one with
the necessary information. A choice or free will of the moderator is
not involved, however. 

- As a side effect, this will encourage IN member nomics to vote
early, so they can influence IN's vote.

I sent my Appeal decision on 930 just a few hours before the time limit,
but I didn't bother to check the Registrar's Report, and sent it to former
CotC Michael instead of current CotC Andre. Sorry about that.

If anyone wonders, this was my intended decision:

]My decision is to OVERTURN and reverse the original Judgement.
]
]I agree with Justice Michael and disagree with Justice elJefe in that a
]destroyed Currency is not a Currency, and that anything else would be in
]direct opposition to the basic meaning of "destroyed".

Greetings,
Ørjan.
