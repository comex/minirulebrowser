Promotor's Privilege

Under the authority of Rule 1772, I hereby raise the priority of "Trumpet Mark
II" by one.

It's important to get these loopholes closed, IMO.

  Well, semester's over and I have to head home for the summer.  I
thank y'all for the interesting parts of the last few months.  I
enjoyed my Agora experience a good bit overall.

A few pieces of business:

  * I transfer all of my VT's to the X Group.
  * I transfer 2 P-Notes to the X Group.
  * I transfer 1 Indulgence to the X Group.

That should take care of all my assets.  In addition, I transfer 1
Kudo from myself (for the heck of it) to Steve, for all of his groovy
proposals lately.

I deregister from Agora.

Thanks for everything, guys.

Farewell, Sherlock.  I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again,
sometime.

This, of course, invalidates my Probate plan for Jester.  So, here goes again,
this time the way I should have done it in the first place:

My new plan for Jester's probate is to transfer all of eir assets to the Player
who meets the criteria specified in Jester's will.
