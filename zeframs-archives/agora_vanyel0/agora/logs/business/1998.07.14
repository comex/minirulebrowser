Proposal: Making On Hold Safe Again

I hereby submit the following proposal and pay one P-Note to raise its priority
by one.

Proposal: Making On Hold Safe Again
This proposal shall have an AI of 1

Amend Rule 1713 by replacing the following text:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

with the text:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied, unless the Payment Order was issued while the
      Payor was On Hold, in which case the Payment Order becomes overdue
      if it has been effective and unsatisfied for more than seven days
      after the Payor first comes Off Hold.

[All of the other solutions seemed to me to be more complicated and to open up
other possible holes.  This is the simplest way to force Players to pay off all
debts before going On Hold and then give them the full seven days to pay off
anything that came due while they were away.]
