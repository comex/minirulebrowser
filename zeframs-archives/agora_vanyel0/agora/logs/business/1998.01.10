Proto:  Plots (v3.0)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

     There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
     by the Bank.

     Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
     Objection.

     A Plot's owner may give the Plot to any other consenting entity.

[Bank-owned Plots are traded by the Chancellor on its behalf.]

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

     Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
     Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

       * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
       * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
     Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
     entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

     Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
     initially owned by the Bank.

     Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  All
     Structures are initially unassigned.

     An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
     Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already assigned
     to that Plot.

     An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
     Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
     assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
     Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

     Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

     As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
     Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs to that
     Player.  In addition, e shall order the Cartographor to create 5
     Structures and give them to the Player; the Cartographor shall do so as
     soon as possible after being so ordered.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.  For each Player, 5 VTs, 5
P-Notes, and 15 Ergs are created in that Player's possession.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

     All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
     unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

     An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
     Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank (if the new Type
     is defined by the Rules) or the Maintainer of the new Type's Blueprint
     (otherwise).

     As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
     shall execute a Payment Order for half the old Type's price (rounded down)
     to the Structure's owner, from the Bank (if the old Type is defined by the
     Rules) or the Maintainer of the old Type's Blueprint (otherwise).

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

     Each Structure has a Maintenance Fee that becomes due at the beginning of
     each month.  When due, the Maintenance Fee for a Structure is paid when an
     entity successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of that
     Structure's Maintenance Fee, provided that e indicates clearly that the
     Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Maintenance Fee for that
     Structure.

     One week after a Structure's Maintenance Fee becomes due, if it has not
     yet been paid, then it becomes delinquent.  As soon as possible after this
     happens, the Cartographor shall destroy that Structure.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

     As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
     Cartographor shall report the Production of all Structures.

     When the Cartographor reports the Production of a Structure for a given
     Nomic Week, a number of units of the appropriate Currency are created in
     the possession of the owner of the Plot to which the Structure is
     assigned.

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered to be two
     players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and any
     Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead given to
     its owner.

     Only one Vatican may exist at any time, and it is always owned by the
     Bank.  Its Production is a number of Indulgences equal to the number of
     Blots issued and not vacated during the previous Nomic Week.

A Structure is assigned to Area 42 and becomes the Vatican.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

     A Type of Structure exists only if it is specifically defined in the Rules
     or in a Blueprint.

     The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
     Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

       Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
       ----------------------------------------------------
       Idle         none       none         none
       Farm         4 Ergs     5 VTs        1 Erg
       House        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
       Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
       Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg
       Vatican      none       special      3 Ergs

Create a new Rule titled "Design of Blueprints" and this text:

     A Currency not Minted by the Bank may be associated with a type of SLC
     known as a Blueprint.  A Blueprint indicates the properties of a Structure
     that produces units of the Currency associated with the Blueprint.  The
     Blueprint's Maintainer is the Mintor of the associated Currency.

     A Blueprint can only be created through an Application to Create a
     Blueprint. Such an Application must contain the following information:

       * The name of the Type of Structure defined by the Blueprint.
       * The type and amount of Currency produced by this Type.
       * Any changes to the amount of Currency produced by this Type due to its
           Adjacencies to other Structures.
       * The Price of this Type.
       * The Maintenance Fee of this Type.

     The Maintainer of a Blueprint may change its text by posting the changes
     to the Public Forum, and indicating what Blueprint is being changed. Such
     changes may only take effect if the new text of the Blueprint would still
     define each of the properties of the Type listed above.

[This allows multiple Blueprints per non-Rule-defined Currency.]

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

     Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
     Plots.

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
     which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it is
     Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
     to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Remove other Currency inputs; make P-Notes useful]


Amend Rule 1471 ("Creation and Destruction of Currencies") by replacing the
text reading:

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

with the text:

      New units of a Currency can only be created by an assigned
      Structure of the appropriate Type to produce that Currency,
      as described in other Rules. 

Rename Rule 1763 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II") to "Intentional
Transfers to the Bank") and amend it to read:

      If an Entity transfers Currency to the Bank and specifies a 
      purpose for this transfer, and the transfer succeeds in
      accomplishing that purpose, the Bank shall, as soon as possible,
      destroy that Currency. 

[Rules 1754 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") and Rule 1763 currently have
  identical text.]

Repeal Rule 1684 ("VT Supply").

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

     A Proposal is Disinterested if it is clearly labelled as such by its
     Proposer.  If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing "submitted its Proposal
concerning a given Rule" with "submitted its Proposal concerning a given Rule,
and paid the Petition Fee for that Proposal,".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

     As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the Assessor
     shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player who submitted a Proposal
     which was adopted during the previous Week.


Amend Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals") by appending this paragraph:

     All Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Proposal shall be adopted
     unless its Proposal Fee is paid by the end of its voting period.


[Part Five:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
       * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
       * the ownership of all Ergs
       * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
       * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
           the last Report
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
           Report


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

     When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

     "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
     has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").
