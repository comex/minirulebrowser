Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.3)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless another Rule states
      otherwise.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
      initially owned by the Bank, unless otherwise specified.  No entity other
      than the Bank may own more than five Structures.

      A Structure is created or destroyed whenever a Player reports its
      creation or destruction as required by the Rules.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures are created in the Bank's possession.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 50 Ergs to that
      Player.  In addition, the Registrar shall report to the Cartographor that
      3 Structures are created in that Player's possession.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, 50 Ergs, and 3 Structures are
            created in that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank.

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
      shall pay out half the old Type's price (rounded down) to the Structure's
      owner.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      Only Types of Structure defined by the Rules exist.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle       none       none           none
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      A Church's Production depends on its color.  A green Church Produces 1
      Indulgence and becomes red; a red Church produces 0 Indulgences and
      becomes green.

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it
      is Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

I disagree.  More generally, this involves determining a
Player's state of mind--something which is already required
by the generally well-regarded R1497, Truth in Advertising.

It is not the Judge's duty to determine what the Rules "should"
or "should not" do, IMO.

As I noted in my argument, this is an overly broad and non-standard
interpration of the word "greed."

I appeal this Judgement.

197 = Rule 1471 Creation and Destruction of Currencies

Nothing exciting.  I'll choose Rule 795 this week.  Maybe someone will come up
with some interesting penalties for quoting certain Rules.  8)

PROTO: The General Fund

Preface: This was inspired by Oerjan's comment that Indulgences were
a closed system.  The fact is, the one reason we have inflation is
because we mint money whenever we need it.  This Proposal is a half
step toward closing the economy.  The Chancellor can still mint as
many whatevers in the Bank as e wants, but e'll have to levy a tax to
get it into the General Fund.  This is all fairly simple, most of
this is replacing "Bank" with "General Fund" in various places in
the Rules.


Let the following Rule be created {Title: The General Fund};

     There shall be a Nomic Entity called the General Fund.  The 
     purpose of the General Fund is to be a repository of currency that 
     shall be used to finance the activity of Agora.  The General Fund 
     does not have Mint Authority.

Let the following Rule be created {Title: The Chancellor is Executor of
the General Fund};

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the General Fund.  As soon as
      possible after a Payment Order is executed for which the General
      Fund is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the General
      Fund's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by 
      making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if 
      another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the General Fund
      for any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Let the following Rule be created {Title: Taxation}

     If, at the beginning of a nomic week, the sum of the amounts of all 
     outstanding Payment Orders of a specific currency naming the 
     General Fund as payee exceeds half of the amount of that currency 
     possessed by the General Fund, the Chancellor must issue a tax levy 
     for that currency for that week.

     When the Chancellor levies a tax for a specific currency e issues a 
     Payment Order from each entity possessing more than a single unit
     of that currency to the General Fund.  The amount of this Payment 
     Order shall be a percentage of that entity's assets so that all
     named entities are assessed an equal percentage, and the sum of all 
     such Payment Orders exceeds the sum of all outstanding Payment 
     Orders of that currency naming the General Fund as payee.

     If an entity becomes subject to Persistent Indebtedness for one of 
     these taxes, e is guilty of the Crime of Tax Evasion, a Class C 
     Crime.

{Comment: This is the basic taxation Rule, it's a flat tax across the
          board, and the MUQ rules should take care of rounding.  I've
          left the power to tax fairly broad, believeing that our
          Officer rules are robust enough to eject someone who abuses
          the power.}


Rule 1479 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1727 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1723 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1724 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1771 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1754 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";  It's title changes to "Inadvertent Transfers
to the General Fund"

Rule 1661 is amended to read;

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the General Fund to specific Players,
      only as specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the General Fund to one Player for not more
      than 1 unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank.  The Player
      to receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Rule 1739 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1442 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1435 is amended to read as follows;

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof
      since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the General Fund, is known as that number of Blots.  When a
      Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a 
      Payment Order shall be executed with that Player as the payor, the 
      General Fund as the payee, and for a number of Indulgences equal 
      to the number of Blots that Player is to receive.  This order is 
      to be executed by whomever is required to report the change in 
      Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the General Fund as payee, including orders which 
      are disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player 
      with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Rule 1712 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

Rule 1653 is amended by replacing all instances of the word "Bank" with
the word "General Fund";

This Report is in error in that it does not include the 3 points
