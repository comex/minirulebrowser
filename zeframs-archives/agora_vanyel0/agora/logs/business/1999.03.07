I hereby submit the following proposal.A

Blob

Proposal: Flexible Unemployment Benefits

Amend Rule 1858 to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who does not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous month an unemployment benefit.

      The value of the unemployment benefit is a proportion of the
      Basic Officer Salary, the same for all Players. It can be set 
      by the Registrar by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing
      so, provided that e announces a value between 0% and 100% inclusive
      in units of 10%, and that e makes the announcement before the 25th
      day of the month.

This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Summary Adoption" and is to
have Adoption Index 3.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 3, to read:

      (a) The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted
          Without Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (b) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time
          its Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance
          with the procedure for performing changes Without Objection,
          but only if at that time that Proposal has not yet been
          distributed.

      (c) When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed
          from the Queue.

      (d) A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is considered to be
          Disinterested.

      (e) This Rule takes precedence over:
        (1) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal from being Adopted
            Without Objection;
        (2) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being removed from the Proposal Queue; and
        (3) any Rule which would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without
            Objection from being considered Disinterested.

Prolegomena to the Study of Early Agoran History: Part I

Hello, all.

  	While studying for my comprehensive exams recently, I happened to
go through my old notebooks and rediscovered some notes I made some time
ago as part of a project to lay out the history of Agora, beginning with
its incarnation as Nomic World and continuing to the present. In the
event, this history never materialized, partly due to real life concerns,
and partly due to the Great Hard Drive crash experienced by my computer
two years ago which wiped out most of my research. Nevertheless, I decided
that the publication of my notes would be useful for several reasons.
First, for some time now, I believe, the archives kept by Dan Blaheta have
not been accessible (particularly the proposal and listserv archives).
This may not be a permanent situation, but I felt it is good to get what
information I have into the public domain so that it is not all lost.
Second, I hope to encourage others to complete the work that I started,
and possibly to jog some old memories. I hope others who experienced the
events narrated will contribute their own personal experiences and
impressions in order to flesh out what is a very skeletal picture. I have
divided this exposition into two parts: a summary, which I expect will be
the most interesting (and briefest) portion, then a list of information
and sources that I have compiled. Even if the proposal logs are recovered,
I hope the summary I give will prove to be of some use as a reference
tool. It is a bit ironic that this presentation does not qualify for a
Doctor of Nomic History degree, but I will be content if it is posted on
one of the Agora websites so it is available to future Players.

Part I, Summary:
	Before I begin I want to clearly delineate the limits of this
enquiry. My investigation, while it lasted, centered around Nomic World
and the early years of Agora, because those were the periods needing the
most compilation and organization (although Steve's summary of the Nomic
World games is excellent). Thanks to Don Blaheta, I was able to examine
the preserved proposal logs through early June 1994. The scope of this
study is therefore the first year of Agora's existence (although it
acquired that name only towards the end), ending with the infamous Black
Repeals and their fallout.

Source material:
	The sources I have preserved for this period will be laid out more
fully in part II, but I will summarize them here. They consist of:
1. Proposal Logs
	These are incomplete. Although a full record of the text and
voting was kept for the earliest proposals, after Proposal 530 or so we
only have passing Proposals recorded, and after 783 no Proposals are
recorded in the logs except 822-877, about which I have only the scantiest
notes. Here is the breakdown:
	Props 301-484 (184): All but 1 or 2 kept.
	Props 485-541 (58): 49 kept, 8 missing
	Props 542-792 (151): 111 kept, 40 missing
--For this period, only passing proposals were kept (with one or two
exceptions)
	Props 793-1082 (290): 3? or 4? kept, rest missing.
-- Props 916-1080  constituted the Black Repeals.
My detailed research did not progress past this point. Note that I do not
have copies of the logs themselves, just notes I took while looking at
them while I had them. So my information is in general very sparse indeed.

2. CFJ Logs
	These follow the pattern of Proposals. Early CFJ's, numbers 1-61,
were preserved more or less complete (although I don't know where they are
now). Later CFJ's are almost entirely missing, although Andre's stare
decisis compilaion helps somewhat. The CFJs in Vanyel's archives include
none before CFJ 707. Note several hundred CFJs were submitted in a Scam in
the late summer of 1994, skewing the numbers somewhat. These later CFJ
logs are still a useful source, since they quote many earlier Rules, but I
have left the job of sifting through them for that purpose to someone
else.

3. Listserv logs
	I was never able to look at these. A recent query to yoyo has
revealed that no logs before August of 1995 are preserved. Teleport began
being used only later in 1994. Therefore, I think any researcher for this
period is out of luck here.

4. Other records
	These include Chris Monsour's Agora Digest, published for a few
weks in August of 1994, and Andre Engel's compilation of older CFJ
decisions. Both refer to earlier Rules and CFJs, allowing a reconstruction
of the content of earlier Proposals. I should also mention the current
Ruleset, which via the inclusion of the past history of present
Rules, also aids the historian.

5. Players:
	Since the game is only (only!) five years old, obviously most of
the early players are still around, and several are still playing. A more
detailed list appears in Part II, but here is a short list of the more
active and influential early players. I apologize if I leave anyone out.
Alexx (Full name?): Early member of Agora.
Karl Anderson: Early member of Agora.
Dave Bowen: Charter member of Agora.
Chuck Carroll: Founder of Agora, Originator of Ruleset and eternal
Rulekeepor.
Jeffrey Caruso (elJefe): Later member of Agora.
Wes Contreras: Creator of Nomic World, and early member of Agora
Doug Chatham: Member of Nomic World, and charter member of Agora
David Cogen (KoJen): Very early member of Agora (though not charter)
Scott de Brestian (Vlad): Very early member of Agora (though not charter)
Steve Gardner: Charter member of Nomic World, but did not join Agora until
much later (Summer 1994, I believe).
Garth (full name)?: Joined Agora in early 1994, and was influential during
and after the Black Repeals.
Scott Goering (kelly, General Chaos): Later member of Agora. (8/94)
Oerjan Johansen: Member of Nomic World, but did not join Agora until
later.
Ronald Kunne (Alice, Stella?, TAL): Charter member of Agora, and
Troublemaker at Large.
David Nicol: Charter member of Agora.
Michael Norrish: member of Nomic World, and First Speaker and charter
member of Agora.
Malcom Ryan (Blob). Member of Nomic World and Charter Member of Agora.
Left Agora immediately after its inception, but has since returned.
Dave Wagner (Waggie): Member of Agora, and original Scamster.

   I am sure most of these can shed much light on some of
these early events, although an earlier canvas looking for hard
documentation produced little. Naturally, my own memories, being easiest
to access, color the following account more than those of others.

Summary chronology of Agora Events: This is a much abbreviated version of
Part II.

coercive voting, begun by David Wagner. First of the Great Scams.
c. Feb. 21, 1994: Props. 823-877? proposed (these actually represent some
7 distributions, according to my estimate, leading into March. One of them
proposed the PT 'Scamster" for David Wagner, thus forming a terminus ante
quem for the Walrus Scam.
Date???: Proposal 864 to destroy the Walrus Marks.
Feb. 21-April 7: Semimutable Rules instituted, Protoproposals instituted
(the latter very close to April 7), rewarding players for protoing.
April 8, 1994: Ronald Kunne CFJs to abolish limit on Proposal
Submission.
April 15, 1994: Black Repeals submitted (Proposals to repeal entire
Ruleset). Noteworthy that the object of this scam was to win through
garnering points by Protoproposing the BP's (see above), not to repeal the
Ruleset.
c. April 22, 1994: Black Repeals Pass
Date???: CFJ 143: Are Black Repeals legal?

flawed 865 (Protoproposal Rule) in works. I believe this date was obtained
from email I had kept from the period.
June 3, 1994: CFJ 149 to determine whether Alice, David Nicol,
or Coren were Players at some date before May 30. (Coren had registered
May 30).

Historical Summary: Since I gathered all this information, I feel I should
give at least a sketch of events, as well as my commentary on them. Many
important issues can only be touched on here; I leave that work for my
successors, if any.

	Agora's first year was a wild and woolly one. It began with
legislation that helped define the future of the game, and ended with two
of biggest crises in its history, the last of which nearly brought the
game to an end. As with all births, there were some teething pains, and
some coordination problems, but the fires in which Agora was tested gave
it the strength to face the future with confidence and hope. Through all
of these events, we can see the reoccurrence of themes that have resounded
throught the history of this game, and which still have relevance today.
	The first month of play was relatively uneventful, as 33 out of 45
Proposals failed. The legislation that was passed, and much that was
debated, focused on the basic elements of the game: Proposing, Voting, and
Judging. Regarding Proposing, early legislation sought to impose limits of
one kind or another: on the number of Proposals (303), the format of
Proposals (319), and the content thereof (326, 334). An attempt to
encourage Proposing also marked the introduction of a mini-game that was a
sort of precursor to Contests (330). With regard to scoring, the simple
F-A formula (302) won out over attempts to reinstitute (from Nomic World)
a form of "PC" Voting, in which Players were awarded points for being on
the winning side and lost points for being on the losing side of a
Proposal (315, 335). In addition, an attempt to bend the "one person, one
vote' concept failed (304). An early attempt at copyright legislation
failed (334). The kind of statements which could be CFJ'ed were restricted
(337), beginning a long sequence of CFJ reform. Also significant was the
first attempt, by E. Scheirer, to exploit and then patch a 'hole' allowing
Proposals to hand out points to those voting FOR (325, 326). Although this
attempt failed,  it provided a precedent which would culminate in the
Walrus Scam (see below).
	Similar concerns characterized August. There was another
unsuccessful attempt to institute a Voting economy (354), and Judging
rules were clarified somewhat (364, 367). New was the attempt to legislate
associations of Players, in an attempt to create Party competition (356).
Despite continued efforts, mandating Player associations would prove to be
a failure. Immediately after the first Rule, three others (389-91) refined
the concept, and attempted to create an economy, another perennial goal,
through the creation of Group Coins. Unfortunately, there was no
restriction on the minting of coins, and it would be a long time before
problems with the creation and valuation of these currencies would be
solved. August also saw Agora's first Win, as evidenced by a series of
CFJs made in response (9-11). Unfortunately, the name of the winner is not
preserved. 
	After the victory, although probably not in response to it, there
was a relaxation of some of the restrictions on Proposals implemented
earlier, as well as a removal of point rewards for Proposing and Voting.
(377, 385, 383, 423). There were also the first significant steps in the
elaboration of the judicial system: Appeals (384) and Crimes (381,
425-27), although it was a considerable time before either was really
refined. The recent creation of a Scorekeeper (352) led to general
legislation regarding Players with specific game responsibilities, known
as Officers (386, 405). This legislation allowed the creation of three new
Offices, that of Rulekeepor (399), Clerk of the Courts (406-410), and
Archivist (417). As a result of these events, it was felt the powers and
responsibilities of the Speaker (not an Office) also needed clarification
(396, 402). There was also a backlash against earlier legislation (357)
mandating the use of certain terminology when referring to the speaker
(397). This was paralleled by other Proposals seeking to preserve Player
rights (392, 398, and later 488).  
	 CFJ 25, submitted in early September, attempted to clarify
several Wins, so it is clear there was more than one during this period.
It is possible that these led in part to the general removal of Point
awards mentioned above, although it is hard to say how long that reaction
lasted.  September saw the creation of the Vototron, an automatic entity
which cast votes depending on whether more points were transfered to its
FOR or AGAINST 'basket' and another game, the 'Secret Word Sweepstakes"
(446). Another entity was created, the Point Reserve, as a theoretical
foundation for a Points economy. Also needed was a Rule prohibiting
unregulated changes to those entities, provided by 449. Point Transfers,
permitted at least since 374, were taxed by 470. Another important
development was the definition of the Public Forum, which made clear what
communication methods were official and what not (478), which can also be
related to the interest in Player's rights. An associated Office, the
Distributor, was created about the same time (510-514).
 	Interest in creating an economy was given new impetus by Wes.
Borrowing from an idea of mine from Nomic World, he tried to create a
Marks economy, overseen by the Banker, which included Rules for interest
and buying of extra votes (516-20, 533). This marked the long and
checkered history of the Mark, which lingered on for quite a while.
	October began with a raft of 17 CFJs, which must mark some
controversy, although I haven't the slightest recollection, despite having
served as Judge of three of them (the actual Statements are not
preserved). With regard to legislation, yet another contest, the Secret
Word Contest, was instituted (561; at a later date this was scammed by a
Player who posted the dictionary, an act that was not well-received).
Another two offices, the Registrar and the Auditor (a duplicate
Scorekeeper) were introduced (559, 568). The Vototron was also overhauled
(574), if I remember correctly the number of Votes it cast was raised. The
Criminal Court (598-608?), which was currently inactive since it had been
judged that Crimes were unenforceable, was overhauled yet again by Wes;
unfortunately, several key elements failed, thus emasculating the reform.
Of a more permanent influence was Chuck's Currency legislation (610-615),
which put Coins, Marks, and Points (?) under a common set of Rules, as
well as reinstituting taxes. An associated move to stimulate the economy
was Ronals Kunne's Stock legislation (643), which tried to implement an
idea that had been bandied about for some time. Players would bid on
Stocks named after each Player, and would recieve Marks based on that
Player's performance. At about the same time the conceptof official Titles
for Players culminated in the Patent Title, of which the first two
were Hero (given to Peter Suber) and First Speaker (given to Michael
Norrish). Another Office, held by the Sweepstakes Officer, relieved the
Speaker of the burden of administering the many games now in operation (it
must be remembered that at this time the Speaker also distributed
Proposals and tallied Votes). Jim Shea successfully proposed five
Proposals (662-669), the title of the first of which, "Liberalize CFJs"
indicates that this was another CFJ reform which, if I remember correctly,
introduced the possibility of a Judge handing down Injunctions compelling
action under certain circumstances (for example, an offender could be
required to post a Formal Apology).
   For most of November, I don't have notes regarding the content of
Proposals, meaning I did not think them of particular historical
significance at the time. Jeffrey S. passed legislation allowing
Abstentions (683), and Ronald Kunne devised the Office of Groupmeister
(686), who oversaw the activities of Groups (of which there was little as
yet). Ronald, in the uniquely numbered proposal 686.1, proposed something
having to do with Peter Suber, and it is quite possible this was the
actual proposal making him a Hero. For another proposal by Ronald (690) I
have the note 'Allowed Judgment by majority Vote'. If that was literally
true, it didn't last long, but I suspect it applied only to
Appeals. Also in the populist vein was a proposal by Jim Shea (713)
creating a Poverty Line based on the average Point totals, and any Player
below it got free points. This worked fine until a few Players accumulated
the majority of Points placing just about everybody below the Poverty
Line.
  Toward the middle of the month, it was obvious that Stocks were not
working out as originally passed (the exact reason why I don't remember),
so Ronald passed another comprehensive Stock overhaul (725-731). A new
Patent Title, that of Marxist, was created for the Player who had the most
Marks (736). This was given to KoJen, who held the title for most if not
all of that currency's existence, which made his Stock most valuable.
Proposal 747 conserved the quantity of Currencies, which contributed to
the aforementioned Poverty Line problem as well as the stability of Marks
(also because there was little to spend them on), ultimately defeating the
system. Another Patent Title, that of Champion, was also created toward
the end of the month (755).
   December brought a number of important proposals, although the
approaching holidays reduced vote totals. Group Voting was introduced
(767). The increase in non-Player Voting entities induced Chuck to
institute Sane Proposals (779), which were immune from such influence.
Formal Apologies were revamped (or possibly introduced--781). New
Rules designed by Chuck with help from Oerjan and others protected the
Game from sudden Speaker abandonment (785-786), and rules governing electioneering
and Injunctions were revised (789, 790).
	There seems to be an odd periodicity to Agoran events. The end of
the calendar year seems to breed relatively less turmoil and controversy
than the first half. The four most catastrophic and divisive events in
Agoran history, the fall of Nomic World, the Walrus Scam, the Black
Repeals, and the Mousetrap Scam, all occured in late Winter or Spring.
Early 1994 was to see two of these occur in succession, a crisis that
nearly ended Agora's brief existence.
   Unfortunately for the historian, this is also one of the most poorly
documented periods. This may very well be due to the unsettled conditions
then prevailing in Agora, but it makes the work of detailed reconstruction
difficult even for those that experienced them. I apologize if the
following account is more circumstantial and subjective than that
presented to this point.
  I have no records or recollections for the end of January or early
February. The best that can be said it that it was the quiet before the
storm. For some reason, the discussion had turned to coercive Proposals,
proposals that attempt to bribe voters into passing them by offering
rewards to those voting FOR. These had been prohibited since Proposal 326,
but David Wagner felt the current Rule had a hole. Now by my recollection,
David made a first attempt to bypass this Rule, which succeeded (?). I
don't remember the details. At any rate a fix to the Rule was proposed and
passed, I believe by David Wagner himself (822). David then set the goal
for himself of overcoming this Rule as well. As I recall, it prohibited
rewarding Players in any existing currency (if not worded like that, that
was the effect). David circumvented this prohibition by making a Proposal
that rewarded FOR voters with Walruses, a currency that didn't exist at
the time. However, these turned into Marks 10 ^-31 seconds after their
creation and distribution (or some similarly tiny interval), thus creating
the rewards. Now there were a number of Players at the time who didn't
approve of the whole idea, perhaps particularly as David had already made
an earlier attempt. Obviously, these were mostly the minority that voted
against. At the same time, Ronald Kunne and Oerjan Johansen were
conducting a humorous discussion on the quantum effects of Walruses
existing for such a short interval. Eventually the argument emerged that
perhaps the uncertainty in their position caused by their being in
existence for such a brief time meant that no Player could with certainty
have been said to have possessed them before their destruction. At least
that was the flavor if the discussion. Humorous enough, but it
got turned into a CFJ (by Oerjan?) and was Judged by a Player hostile to
the Walruses (Dave Bowen???). Although the Quantum argument was not the
only one considered, the Judge did decree, on what many regarded as
spurious grounds, that the Walruses never existed. This judgment,
naturally, increased the ill-will between David Wagner and his opponents.
The aftermath was quite complicated. David pursued the legal recourses
that were open to him (at that time, I think Appeal was by proposal), but
failed. At the same time, compromisers tried to placate him with a lesser
reward. I have in my notes that Prop. 864, dated c. April 7, destroyed the
Walrus marks. I do not remember whether this was due to a finding that
they did exist, a precaution in case they did, or something else. At any
rate, disgusted with delayed justice (as he perceived it), David Wagner
quit the game in anger, never to return. He was later given the Patent
Title of Scamster in recognition of his efforts.
	No sooner had the one controversy died out than the seeds of the
next were planted. Proposal 865 instituted a reward for Players who 
published proposals for comment before actually submitting them. Ronald
Kunne, an ardent opponent of the Rule, saw an opportunity for a Scam.  He
made 165 Protoproposals, one for each Rule in the ruleset, each proposing
that one Rule be repealed. He would later claim he chose this avenus
because it was fast and easier than thinking up 165 seperate proposals. At
the same time, he CFJ'ed that the limit on the number of Proposals was
ineffectual, and won. This allowed him to Propose the Black Repeals, as
they were soon to be known, and garner the reward for having protoproposed
them, an amount that would allow him to win the game handily. A clean
scam, or it would have been, had the semester not been winding down for
many Players. Ronald voted for his proposals, to reduce the F-A penalty
when (so he assumed), they were defeated. Others voted FOR out of
mischeviousness. A few voted for some select repeals, but against the
rest, but most were content with a blanket FOR or AGAINST. Many, myself
included, concerned with RL duties and assuming they would fail, didn't
vote at all. In the end, when the votes were tallied, all the Black
Repeals had more FOR votes than AGAINST. At a stroke, it appeared that the
entire ruleset, apart from those few rules requiring supermajorities to
repeal, was gone.
	There was chaos. Immediately every player was roused by the
unprecedented event. Soon, a few distinct positions were established.
Some players challenged the legality of the Black Repeals. Others accepted
their validity, but were willing to try to rebuild the ruleset from the
wreckage. And yet others felt that the damage was too severe, that the
game would have to be restarted. Most of the latter two groups were also
willing to consider the issue of legality, but were undecided. Of course,
the problem was that those who sincerely believed that the BRs were legal
also would dispute the results of any putative CFJ or Proposal, since in
their mind those institutions had been eliminated in the destruction.
Nevertheless, a CFJ was made, claiming the BRs were invalid on the grounds
that they did not have titles, which proposals were legally required to
have. Ronald and his defenders replied (1) that that Rule had never been
enforced, and that there were several recent counterexamples. and (2) that
the BRs could be considered to have implicit Titles (e.g. "Repeal Rule
201" could be considered both a Proposal's Text and its Title). Meanwhile,
Chuck and I each proposed legislation that would have reinstated the old
Ruleset. While we agreed that such proposals could not have any in-game
validity, we might all agree in the spirit of the game to abide by the
meta-game decision of the majority.
   In the end, CFJ 143(?) was judged TRUE, and an Injunction against the
BRs was handed down. Since the BRs were deemed not to have passed, the CFJ
did have validity. No one seriously opposed the decision, since it offered
a way out of the dilemma. The flawed Rule 865 was passed fixing the
original hole, and Agora (now the official Name of the Game) returned to
some semblance of normality.




Appendix I: Proposal record 7/1/93-9/23/93
Since nearly complete records are extant for this period, I thought it
would be interesting to generate some statistics. The following includes
all Proposals except the disputed Props. 440-445 and a couple for which no
info is preserved. Withdrawn Proposals include those for whom the Proposer
is known but the vote totals (if any) are not. Withdrawn Proposals are
listed but ignored for the calculation of the statistics.

Players with five or more Proposals:

Bowen, David Nicol, Michael Norrish.]

7/1/93		Prop. 301		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Doug
0:00 GMT						Chatham, failed

2:45 GMT	Prop. 302		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Joe

of the Voting Period, but there are
discrepancies.]
[Joined: Wes, delphin, Ronald Kunne, Karl Anderson, Deb & Bob, Richard
Vickery. Left: Blob, Doug Chatham. Note that the only way to know who was
a player at a given point is by who voted or Judged CFJs. As far as I know
this is the only record. Therefore, the players above could have joined
any time during the Voting Period of Props 301-3 (i.e., July 1-8), and the
date a Player leaves can only be approximated. Also note I was not 100%
diligent in listing Players joining or (especially) leaving, so the list
is probably incomplete.]

of a vote, respectively.]
[Alexx, Oerjan Johansen, David Cogen, and Kevin Watkins joined. I am not
sure why these names are listed at this point since the number of voters
jumps up with proposal 334. It may well be that these Players voted on
that one as well.]

		CFJ 10			CFJ Logs	Submitted? by Deb & Bob
. 			 		RS1		Proposal sent by 
					stare.txt	the Old Speaker to
							New Speaker remains
							valid. Judgment: TRUE.
[Hitherto I have been assuming that the individuals I have in my notes
under each CFJ are the submitters. This is explicitly noted by me for CFJ
8, and explains why I have Jim Shea listed under CFJ 1 and Andre's stare
decisis compilation lists Michael: One submitted, the other judged. In
this case, however, we both have Deb and Bob, who must either be the
submitter or the Judge, so one of the above assumptions is, at least in
this case, false. Nevertheless, unless I have specific info otherwise, I
will continue listing the submitter.]

		Prop. 374		Prop. Logs	Proposed by J.
							Shea, passed 7-3. 
							Regulated Point
							Transfers.
		CFJ 11			CFJ Logs	Submitted by R.
							Vickery. Statement:
							Votes on a Proposal
							remain the same
							after a game ends.
							Judgment: TRUE.
[The contents of CFJs 10-12 clearly suggest a game had just ended. Since
the questions are pretty basic, it stands to reason (also given the date)
that the end of the first Game of Agora occurred shortly before Aug. 16.
New info from Michael Norrish reveals that the winner was Wes, that he won
when Oerjan agreed to trade Wes 58 points in exchange for voting FOR
Proposal 361, giving Wes 109 points, over the 100 point win threshhold.
Thus the game ended some time after August 8. Since Michael indicated that
Props 360-372 were still up for vote, we can further refine the date to
between August 11 (when Props 371-2 were submitted, according to the
reasoning stated above), and August 16.]

TRUE. I think my notes are in error. Also note that I am increasingly
unconvinced by my argument above that all names listed under CFJs are the

since he is listed in stare.txt. Therefore, henceforth I will list the
Players as Judges, not submitters.]

13:15:58MET	CFJ 36			CFJ Logs	Accused speaker of

[This one is a bit strange, since 499 failed some time earlier. If I
recall correctly, the Speaker could affect the number of votes required to
pass a rule by giving or witholding Consent, but I can't see how that
would apply.]

9/23/93		Prop. 529		Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. Anderson,
							passed 5-4.
		Prop. 530		Prop. Logs	Proposed by K.
							Anderson, outcome
							unknown.
[both dated to 23:09:08, thus probably stemming ultimately from a
distribution post.]
13:51:37	CFJ 41			CFJ Logs	Judged FALSE (?)
							by Jeffrey S.
							Subject unknown.
9/24/93		Prop. 535		Prop. Logs	Proposed by K. 	
1:01:56							Anderson, withdrawn.
[The above event is very important, as Proposal 533 is recorded five days
later. This is further proof of the deducible fact that hitherto all
dates are the dates of distribution, and all subsequent dates are dates
the proposal passed (note almost no non-passing proposals get recorded
from this point).]

20:13:10	CFJ 42			CFJ Logs	Claimed the Rules
							would take
							precedence over
							537. Judged FALSE
							by Chuck.
[This is an interesting CFJ. Pity no record of 537 is preserved, probably
because it never passed.]

20:18:34	CFJ 44			CFJ Logs	Argued the Speaker

given are times the CFJ was posted.]

20:35:47	CFJ 45			CFJ Logs	Claimed Rule 367

13:28:42						passed 6-1.
16:51:08	Prop. 539		Prop. Logs	Proposed by K.
							Dankmeyer, withdrawn.
[I realize this weakens my argument given above, but I have no other
explanation why Prop. 535 would be listed out of sequence nor why so many
proposals would be missing. Likely withdrawn proposals were kept initially
along with passed proposals, for unknown reasons.]

10/1/93		CFJ 46			CFJ Logs	Claimed Rule 445 did not
							require Speaker's
							Consent. Judged TRUE by
							Michael Oct 3.
		CFJ 47			CFJ Logs	Claimed 470 was
							ambiguous. Judged
							TRUE by Vlad.
[I have this question marked in my notes, I believe because I didn't
remember judging in this way. I suspected either the question or the
judgment were incorrectly recorded. Without a copy of 470, I can't
decide.)

[Looks like the remains of a Scam, whether Greater or Lesser, but I myself
can't remember any details.]

10/5/93		Prop. 534		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes, passed
							5-2
[That is the number in my notes. If it is not in error, again some screwy
things are going on here. My only conclusion is that the Voting period on
534 was extended, or disputed by some CFJ, so that the results were
announced late. I know that at one time the Voting Period was 14 days
(although clearly not early on), so that may be the explanation.]

[Andre's stare decisis compilation has a comment under this Rule. Did it
pass, or didn't it? The CFJ is number 794, which suggests that it was
submitted late in 1994, so it can't have regarded a dispute on the passage
of 591. Perhaps 591 was determined to have passed at a later date.]

[I have noted that at or before this time Duane Watts and Matthew Sean
Pardo joined, no doubt because their names started showing up in the
voting records.]

[Many, if not all, of these proposals had to do with the creation of a
Criminal Court, to enforce the legislation on Crimes already existing from
Rule 391. As I recall, a few of the proposals in the program didn't pass,
which contributed to the failure of the system.]

[This is dated 10/29/93 in RS1. Interesting it didn't make the Proposal
Logs, if it passed. Suggests proposal Logs may be incomplete even
regarding only passed Proposals.]

		Prop. 659		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,

[Either the Speaker was having fun with a loophole, or Proposal 685 never
existed and an additional number snuck in to make the total come out
right.]

number of Groups automatically.]

		Prop. 719		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck,
							passed 3-0-3.
		Prop. 721		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck,
							passed 4-0-2.

[Note the great jump in votes cast between these proposals and those
following. I have recorded that Gustaff Zibrowski joined about this time,
but that can't explain all of it. It may be that Rule 519 was changed, or
used for the first time, and that many of the Votes were bought.]

11/16/93	Prop. 724		Prop. Logs	Proposed by D.
							Wagner, passed

							Rule for Auctioning 
							Stocks.
		Prop. 761		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck,
							passed 17-0-0.
					RS1		Amended Rule 658.
[Dated to 12/8/93 in RS1, strongly suggesting that the dates above are
dates of distribution, not final vote tallying, which clashes with an
earlier note. I am not sure how to resolve this.]

of these.]

Events between Proposal 783 and Proposal 984 (Dated Aug 5, 1994) are very
sketchy, and need elucidation. I have scraped together the following info
from the last Proposal logs, Ruleset annotations, my own memory, and old
e-mail (now lost).

12/21/93	Prop. 783 passed	Ruleset		

[I recieved a Ruleset about that  date with Prop. 783 included (according
to my notes).]
[Note that this date is obviously the date (approximately) that 783
passed.]

Late Jan.?	Jeffrey S. Speaker	notes		
Date??		Prop. 804		Agora Dig.	Passed. Stock
							Liquidated at End of
							Game.
c. 2/18/94	Prop. 822		RS1		Passed. Prohibited

c. 2/21/94	Prop. 849		memory,	Passed. Changed default
							Salaries for 
					Prop. Logs.	Officers.
					Agora Dig.	
Date??		CFJ 113			notes		CFJ Judged by Vlad,
							subject unknown.
Date??		CFJ 117			stare.txt	Judged by Oerjan. 
							Decided that a
							Vote takes place
							when it is sent to the
							Assessor, not when it
							is counted.
c. 4/7/94	Prop. 864		notes		Proposal to
							Destroy the Walrus
							Marks, passed.
		Prop. 865		e-mail		Proposed by KoJen
							(?), passed.

							Protoproposing.

							Semimutable as a
							class of Rules between
							Immutable and Mutable.
???		Prop. 869		stare.txt	Passed. Defined
							who is a Player.
							Amended Rule #??
???		Prop. 870		Agora Dig.	Passed. Changed
							On/Off Hold Rules.
							Amended Rule 464?	
???		CFJ ???			notes		Called by Ronald. 
							Claimed	limit on 
							Proposals was
							invalid. judged TRUE.
4/8/94		Black Repeals		notes		
		Protoproposed
4/13/94		Prop. 879		RS1		Passed. Amended Rule .
					Agora Dig. 	201
???		Prop. 880		stare.txt	Passed. Regulated

4/15/94		Props. 916-1080		e-mail		Black Repeals, proposed
							by Ronald Kunne, 
							all passed.
Date??		Prop. 1081		e-mail		subject unknown,
							presumably dealt
							with BR's
Date??		Prop. 1082		e-mail		subject unknown,
							see note above.
[If I remember correctly, 1081 and 1082 were attempts (one by me) at a
legislative solution to the BR problem. I believe my proposal proposed a
complete restoration of the earlier game state. If it had been decided
that BRs passed, it would have had no in-game effect, of course, but might
have spurred a meta-game resolution.]
[Note the Black Repeals were found to be illegal, thus their Proposal
numbers were reused later.]

Date??		CFJ 143(?)		notes		CFJ: Are Black
							Repeals legal?
5/30/94		Coren registered	notes

c. 6/3/94	CFJ 149			e-mail		Queried whether Alice,
							D.  Nicol, and

							Repealing.
Date??		Prop. 951		stare.txt	Passed. Defined
							how CotC selects
							Judges. Amended
							Rule #??
7/25/98		Prop. 955		RS1		Passed. Amended Rule
							761.

I hope this makes Steve happy.
