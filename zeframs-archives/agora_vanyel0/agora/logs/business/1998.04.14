Proposal: P-Note supply

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") by replacing the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

[Comment: As Steve pointed out, we lack a regular supply of P-Notes.
This relates supply to spending, but with a bit of complexity. You can
turn a profit by making lots of Proposals with Priority 1, but you have to
make sure they get distributed, and that they pass, which is not easy.]

Proposal: Encourage Bigger Groups

Amend Rule 1752 ("Group Votes") to read:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled

      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes. 

      A Group with three or four Members may cast 2 Votes. 
      A Group with five or six Members may cast 3 Votes.
      A Group with seven or eight Members may cast 4 Votes.
      A Group with nine or more Members may cast 5 Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.
