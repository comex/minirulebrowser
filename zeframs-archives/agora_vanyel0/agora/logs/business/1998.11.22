Proposal: 
The Treasuror 

Create a rule entitled, "The Treasuror", with text:

     There exists an Office called the Treasuror, with a salary equal
     to zero. 

     The Treasuror is elected like any other Office, except that 
     sometime during the Nominating period for the Office, Nominees
     must issue a Budget. Any Nominee who has not issued a Budget is
     not a Candidate for that Election. This rule takes precedence
     over any other rule which may identify Candidates.
     
     A Budget is a list of all Players' names, each with a corresponding
     number of VTs. The number of VTs must be an integral multiple
     of the MUQ of VTs, and cannot be less than zero. The sum of all
     these amounts must be less than or equal to 50 VTs.

     A Budget is issued by posting it to the Public Forum. A Nominee 
     may issue as many Budgets as e wishes, but only the latest Budget
     issued during the Nominating Period of the Election is allowed 
     to be implemented.

     As soon as possible after the Treasuror is elected, e must
     implement eir Budget. E does so by posting it to the Public Forum
     and announcing that e is implementing it. Only the last valid
     Budget e issued in the Nomination Period can be implemented in
     this way.

     At the time the Budget is thus implemented, all outstanding
     Payment Orders are vacated, and all Players' VT holdings are
     set to the values shown in the Budget. The VT holdings of all
     other entities are set to zero, except for the Bank, which 
     shall contain 50VTs.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent
     these changes from being made.

     One week after the Budget has been implemented, this Rule shall
     repeal itself.

[Comments: 

 v1.0 - This allows us to reset the VT economy to a more certain state,
 to end the current crisis. Rather than choose an arbitrary reset value
 to include in the Proposal, it puts into place the mechanism to reset the
 state with some flexibility, so we can determine the exact values as we
 do best - via political wrangling.

 v1.1 - Realised the language in the old version relied on knowing a long
 of the state which we can't really be sure of - details of many past 
 orders and such. Instead, I have just implemented a one-off blanket 
 vacation of all POs.

 Also added the all important self-repeal clause, so we don't have this
 happening regularly. (Unless people think that might be a good thing?)

 v1.2 - Added clause to set all Group & Contest Treasuries to zero,
 and put 50 VTs in the Bank. Also reduced the total Budget allocation
 to 50 VTs.
