This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Standards of Proof" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

'Hypocrisy', Scott? I had hoped that political debate in Agora had not
degenerated to the point at which it becomes necessary to make
accusations of bad faith. I have set out my arguments against 'Summary
Adoption' as clearly as I can: I believe that Summary Adoption will
undermine a lot of what I and others have been trying to do in Agora for
a long time. Perhaps those arguments are mistaken, but I can't see how
that justifies your charge, here and again below, that my motives in
opposing 'Summary Adoption' are other than what I have said they are. I
am especially offended by the suggestion - actually nothing more than a
baseless slur - that my objection to Summary Adoption is fundamentally
self-interested, and I cannot let that slur go unanswered. It is an
attack on my honour, not just my Honour. I always try to act according
to my conception of what is in the best interests of the game, and my
record shows that I have done so even when this was not in my own direct
self-interest. 'Restore Game Balance' is just one example of this; there
are plenty of others. In this instance, our conceptions of the best
interests of the game clearly differ. Such differences are inevitable,
but it would be nice to think that we both were committed to resolving
them without resorting to insults and slander. But, sadly, it is
apparently not so.

I hereby transfer a Kudo from General Chaos, for the reasons given
above, to Elysion, to reward him for a good opening few months as a
Player.
