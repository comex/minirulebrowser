Although this is a very interesting CFJ, and I would certainly like
to consider it, RL does not at the moment permit me the luxury of
the time necessary to do so.  I therefore make myself ineligible
to judge this CFJ.

I have noticed an unclear point in 1633: The ambassador is required by
1633 to submit the first IN proposal made by an Agora player in any
given Nomic week. However, 1633 says nothing whatsoever about
additional proposals: do I have to reject them? Decide whether I want
to submit them to IN or not? are they not really IN proposals?

I invite opinions on this point, and would like to proto the
following improvement:

Amend 1633 by replacing the text

      "Players are permitted to submit InterNomic Proposals, which are
      distinct from Proposals in Agora. Whenever a Player who has not
      previously submitted an InterNomic Proposal in the same Nomic
      Week posts to the Ambassador a text which is clearly intended to
      become an InterNomic Proposal, the Ambassador shall be required
      to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance
      to InterNomic procedures."

with

"All active Players may submit an InterNomic proposals by sending its
text, clearly labeled as InterNomic proposal, to the
Ambassador. 

Whenever a Player who has not previously done so in the same Nomic
Week submits an InterNomic proposal, the Ambassador shall be required
to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance to
InterNomic procedures. When the player submitting an InterNomic
proposal has done so before, in the same Nomic week, the Ambassador
may choose to either reject the proposal or submit it to InterNomic."

BTW, could someone tell me what the last sentence of 1633, 

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

is good for?

IN proposal 349 contains typos, and IN has no explicit way of dealing
with them. I would like to propose to make our rule 754, 

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

However, I wonder what the repetition in the last sentence is good for
and whether one could also leave this sentence out. 

Kolja A.

P.S. Speaking of typos, our recent contribution to IN, rule 349, also
contains one. I have just made an IN proposal to fix this. Trivial,
but may help to get some acceptance for a rule like our 754.

Hmm.  The way I read the message the TOs were contingent on the Bank having
enough.  The fact that they were made for a specific purpose which could not
actually be satisfied does not seem like a contingency to me.  It just seems to
mean the transfer was made but did not serve its intended purpose.  I'm going
to assume the transfer was made.

Steve,  would you mind transferring the 4 P-Notes back to the Bank to obviate
the need for a CFJ?

PROTO: Power of Attorney
Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that 
     means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for 
     as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

     No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than two 
     other Players.

I claim that this Report is in error, in that it incorrectly reports
that the Bank has 0 Indulgences, when in fact it has 17.

I also point out there were Indulgences in the Bank at the start of
the Nomic Week, triggering Rule 1712's distribution provision.

Re: Herald's Report 10 Nov

I noticed I forgot to include the POs for the Indulgence distribution in the
body of the report (which took a long time to come back to me today).  So here
they are, especially for the good Chancellor.  These are reports of existing
POs, they are not to be construed as new orders.

It's tempting not to, but oh well:

I hereby transfer four P-Notes to the Bank.

Claim admitted.  The relevant portion of the Report should read:

---------------------

Yes, and actually the report did show the distribution, although not the POs as
it should have.  I have recently sent a separate mailing of the POs with their
numbers.

This case concerns the effectiveness of an attempted amendment to Rule
by Proposal 3575, which stated that a sentence was to be "added" to a
given paragraph of Rule 1632.  The Rulekeepor stipulates that the term
"added" is ambiguous, in that it does not specify where the sentence
is to be added.  Petitioner Kolja A. asserts that the obvious intent
of the proposal is to append the specified sentence, and that the term
"add" should be taken as a gloss for "append".  This Court holds that
such a gloss, while probably appropriate in this case, is inconsistent
with Rule 1339.

Proposal 3575, adopted Thursday, October 30th and engrossed later that
same day, sought to amend Rule 1632 by "adding" a sentence to the end
of the third paragraph.  Rulekeepor Chuck, in his announcement of Rule
Changes due to Proposals 3555-3576, announced that Proposal 3575
failed to amend Rule 1632 due to ambiguity, citing Rule 594 as basis
for his conclusion.  Upon query, Rulekeepor Chuck stated that the
amendment "doesn't say where in the third paragraph the sentence is to
be added."

Petitioner Kolja A. (also the author of Proposal 3575) argues in his
petition that the clear intent of the Proposal is that the specified
sentence be appended to the specified paragraph, and seeks to invoke
Rule 754 to take "add" as a gloss for "append" in this case.  This
Court rejects this notion.  Rule 754 is only invokable when there is
no ambiguity in meaning.  "Add" is not an unambiguous substitute for
"append".  Prepending would also be a form of "adding", and clearly
prepending and appending are not substitutable for each other.  This
Court therefore feels that the suggested gloss would act to
disambiguate and is thus not permitted by Rule 754.

Petitioner further argues that the only interpretation of this Rule
Change which would make the Rule make sense grammatically is to append
the suggested sentence.  However, this Court sees no reason to
introduce a principle that Rule Changes must be interpreted in the
fashion which "makes the most sense."  It is not the place of the
Rulekeepor to impose rationality on the Electorate's decisions, and if
the Electorate chooses to amend a Rule into a form which is
gramatically contorted or otherwise foolishly constructed, the
Rulekeepor is not entitled to "reinterpret" their intent so as to
avoid that situation.  This Court reflects that, for a time, due to an
error in specification, two paragraphs of either Rule 1434 or Rule
1445 read identically; would Petitioner grant the Rulekeepor the power
to ignore the written word of the Proposal and amend the "intended"
paragraph instead?  The entire purpose of Rule 1339 is to forestall
any consideation of which interpretation is intended; if it's not
absolutely clear, the amendment is ineffective.

Nor is Petitioner's argument that the Rulekeepor is permitted to
reformat paragraphs and otherwise manipulate the appearance of Rules
convincing.  Rule 1339 specifically exempts capitalization and
whitespace from its exactness requirement, suggesting that these
things should not be taken as significant in statutory construction.
The Rulekeepor's modification of these things should not not,
therefore, affect the meaning of the Rules, and is therefore
reasonably permissible (although this Court would likely frown upon
the Rulekeepor were he to arbitrarily capitalize words within Rules in
the manner of his predecessor, and this opinion should be in no way
taken to hold that the Rulekeepor has an unlimited power to change the
capitalization of words within Rules).  The scope of this privilege
cannot reasonably be extended to include moving clauses or sentences
about within the text of a Rule, however; nor should it be extended to
include the power to disambiguate an ambiguously specified Rule
Change, even when one particular disambiguation is clearly preferable
over the other options.

While this Court is sympathetic to Petitioner's argument, it is
clearly foreclosed by Rule 1339.  The determination of the Rulekeepor
is affirmed.  Judgement of FALSE is entered.
