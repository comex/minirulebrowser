>======================================================================

Decision of the Justiciar: FALSE

Judge Steve reasoned that both the Herald and the player reporting the
infraction are required by the Rules to report the change in Blots (though
in different ways).  Either of these will make the statement FALSE, and inb
this appeal I will concentrate on the second of these.

If someone executes a Payment Order for indulgences away from a player to
the Bank, this is a report of a new Blot (or Blots), and is implicitly a
report of a change in Blots.  Thus the statement is FALSE if the Rules
require any player to execute any such POs.

Rule 1504 requires the player reporting an Infraction to execute a PO for
Indulgences to apply the penalty for the Infraction.  No Rule of higher
precedence appears to absolve em of this duty. Therefore the Statement is
FALSE.

In post-judgement discussion, Laurent made much of a supposed conflict
between Rules 1435 and 1504. But even if these Rules imposed the
requirement on different Players, that does not constitute a conflict. If
Rule 1504 requires me to execute a PO and rule 1435 requires Laurent to
execute a PO then I suppose we would both need to execute the PO's.  In any
case at least one player would be required to execute the PO and thus
report a change in Blots.

Even if (for the sake of argument) there was a conflict, 1504's requirement
could only be removed by a higher-precedence rule requiring a different
player to perform the duty.  In this case there would still be a player
required to execute the PO, with the same conclusion.

However, in eir argument Laurent wants to have it both ways.  First, he
claims that 1435 and 1504 require different players to execute the PO.
Then he claims that 1504 does not actually require a Player to execute the
PO.  These cannot both be true.

My higher point is that the mere potential for conflict does not invalidate
the lower-precedence Rule.  If 1504 specifies a player unequivocally, and
1435 tries to specify a player but fails, then there is not an actual
conflict.

elJefe, Justiciar of Agora Nomic


======================================================================
Evidence:

Rule 1435/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.


Rule 1504/5 (Power=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

Murphy,

Oops, it looks like I may have tried to confuse you even more (I was confusing
you with Andre).  You had one delayed TO kick off, which satisfied POI014.  You
still have an outstanding delayed TO which will satisfy POI041, whenever you
manage to get hold of 3 Indulgences.  Your recent post to the PF did not change
this setup.

Additionally, you now have a new PO for 1 Indulgence, POI051, as a result of
the Indebtedness Infraction.

PS.  Here is a list of the latest Indulgence debt POs, which as Scott pointed
out, were not listed in the last report, but will be issued in the next.
