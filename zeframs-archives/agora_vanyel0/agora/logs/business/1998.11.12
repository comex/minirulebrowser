PROTO: Let everyone have a turn v2

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.

[Comments: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
 necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection mechanism
 for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be interesting to
 try something new.

v2: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation]

I hereby submit the following Proposal, and pay 1 P-Note to have its 
Priority raised to one.

Proposal: Fix Promotor's Duties
 
 [Comment: There is no need to make the R-O-M selections and the
  Public Service selections "as soon as possible" obligations. There
  is no urgency in these actions, and if they are not done during
  a week, there is not real need to do them twice the next week.
  So, I propose to remove the ASAP clauses.
 
  While I'm at it, I have removed the requirement to put the Public
  Service list in the Promotor's Report. It is a separate issue and
  should be published separately.]

Amend Rule 1753 (Repeal-O-Matic) by replacing the text:
 
      The Promotor shall select five different Rules, 
 
with: 
 
      Each week, the Promotor shall select five different Rules, 
 
 and deleting the text:

      The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible
      after the beginning of the Nomic Week.

Amend the Rule "A Duty to Propose" by replacing the text:

      The Promotor shall include this list in eir Promotor's Report.
 
with:

      The Promotor shall publish this list each Week.

and the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, 

with:

      Each Week,

H. Promotor,

I hereby submit the following proposal, and transfer 1 P-note from
myself to the bank to raise its priority by one:

>>
Monthly Voting bills

Amend R1442 to read:

      Every vote cast on a proposal has a voting cost, equal to 
      the Voting Tariff at the time the proposal was distributed. 
      The voting cost of a particular vote is unbilled if it has 
      not been billed yet.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the 
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of Voting 
      Tokens equal to the overall unbilled voting cost of all votes
      cast on Proposals by that entity in the past month. 

Amend R1449 by replacing the string "0.5" with "0.7".

I consider *this* TO to be invalid because POI058 has already been satisfied.

Proposal: Simplify Currency Handling

Actually, I like Scott's latest concept of currency handling, but I thought it
would be nice to give Players an alternative, or possibly a short term fix
while we are waiting.  Besides, I have a Duty to Propose.  8)

H. Promotor,

I submit the following proposal, requesting an Adoption Index of 1:

==========================
Proposal: Simplify Currency Handling

Amend Rule 1661 by replacing the text "order the award of" with "pay out" and
by replacing all occurrences of "Payment Order" with "Transfer Order".

Amend Rule 1721 by appending the sentence "The Chancellor has Mint Authority."

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank" with
the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of
P-Notes are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1696 by replacing the text "The Mintor of VTs is the Bank" with the
text "The Mintor of VTs is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of VTs are
added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1846 by replacing the text "Their Mintor is the Bank" with the text
"Their Mintor is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of Ergs are added to the
Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1435 by replacing the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank"
with the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Chancellor.  Newly created
units of Indulgences are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

[Make the Chancellor the Mintor of all "official" Currencies, but make newly
minted units start out in possession of the Bank.]

Amend Rule 1817 to read as follows:

Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to honor all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency, which are considered invalid.
      Transfers shall be honored in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor, unless the Transfer is disputed by CFJ prior
      to being honored.  Such a disputed Transfer, if found valid by the
      Courts, shall be honored as soon as possible after the Court
      publishes its finding.

      Whenever a valid Transfer Order naming the Bank as payor would 
      result in the Bank possessing a negative quantity of Currency, the
      Recordkeepor shall issue a Payment Order from the Bank for the
      same amount of Currency and to the same payee as specified in the
      Transfer Order.

[Changed this business of "noting" transfers on the record to "honoring" the
transfer.  This is more in keeping with the idea that "making a transfer as
ordered" is separate from merely writing down the results of that transfer. 
Also makes it easier to allow disputed TOs to be honored out of sequence, so we
don't have the kind of suspended game state uncertainty that results from a
disputed TO causing subsequent undisputed TOs from being processed.  Also, took
out the requirement to avoid honoring invalid Transfers.  The courts can
rectify that situation and Recordkeepors shouldn't be subject to Rule breaking
penalties for making honest mistakes.]

Amend Rule 1819 by replacing the text "noting a transfer on the records of the
Recordkeepor" with the text "honoring a transfer".

[Companion amendment to the previous - define what it means to "honor a
transfer".]

Amend Rule 1820 to read as follows:

Recording of Transfer Orders

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been honored and if it is in dispute, or the
      resolution of its dispute.  Honored Orders shall be noted on the
      record in the order in which they were honored.  However, the
      Recordkeepor need only maintain records of Orders for four weeks
      after they have been honored or until four weeks after their
      dispute has been resolved.

[Moved the requirement for report ordering here and made it more like the
Payment Order reporting, so everyone can see disputes and their resolution.]

Amend Rule 1470 by deleting the text "The Bank has Mint Authority".

[Mint Authority has been transferred to the Chancellor for the three "official"
Currencies, so the Bank no longer needs Mint Authority.]

Amend Rule 1735 by changing the Title to "The Chancellor's Banking Duties", by
deleting the text "The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.", by deleting
the text "(as the Bank's Executor)", and by deleting the entire last paragraph.

[The definition of "satisfy" for Payment Orders requires the Chancellor to
execute TOs for the Bank's POs.  Under this scheme, the Chancellor can no
longer commit Misappropriation because only TOs authorized by the Rules are
honored when the Bank is payor.]

Amend Rule 1479 by replacing the first occurrence of "Payment Order" with
"Transfer Order".

[Now anytime the Rules say "pay out", it means all the Player has to do is
issue a TO from the Bank to the payee.]

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text "and issue a Payment Order from the Bank
to that Player for one Indulgence" with the text "and pay out one Indulgence to
that Player".
