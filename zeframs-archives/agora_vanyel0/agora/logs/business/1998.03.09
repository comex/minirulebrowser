Impeachment Votes

I vote AGAINST the impeachment of Michael.
I declare presence on the impeachment of Speaker-Elect Blob.

In the year+ that I have been playing, *all* Officers, from Threat or not, have
discharged their duties diligently, fairly, and with honor.  No one has done
anything as an Officer which deserves impeachment.  Therefore I will not vote
FOR any of these impeachment referenda.

OTOH, in turning what was basically an Officers' scam into a Threat scam, the
scammers did injury to other Players.  Although it was well executed and Threat
showed admirable and honorable restraint in their exploitation of the loophole,
IMO, these injuries detract from the overall honor of the scam.  For this
reason, as the only tangible method of expressing mild disapproval of the Group
available to me at this time, I will also refrain from voting AGAINST any
Threat impeachments.  I think it might be a good idea to extend the concept of
Honor and Kudos to Groups.  If others think this is a good idea too, I will
work up a proto.

As to my announcing presence for the impeachment of Speaker-Elect Blob, I have
nothing personal against Blob, but if we are entering into a new era of
political activity along Group lines, then I would prefer to see a
Speaker-Elect come from a different Group than the Speaker.

Dear fellow Agorans,

I haven't seen anyone get a degree yet, so I have to base this on a
cursory reading of the rules and ask you all for assistance as to how
this will continue, but I would like to humbly submit to the scholarly
community of you all the following essay on some recent developments
as my attempt at a thesis for the degree of Bachelor of Nomic.

Kolja A.


Metagaming or Roleplaying - two Approaches to Playing Nomic
===========================================================


I. Introduction
===============

I am a bit disappointed about the flame-war like athmosphere that is
surrounding the present Officer's veto scam and its prelude, the
recent rebellion and elections, and its aftermath, the impeachment of
several officers involved in the scam. Such a brilliant scam, exposing
and using a huge loophole, not really doing any damage to the game as
a whole, and what a high degree of organization and preparation that
went into this project! And here we are fighting over side issues like
little children instead of enjoying, pushing or opposing the main
event...

Instead of joining the melee of accusations, Kudo transfers,
suspicions and fingerpointing that are surrounding this scam (and,
probably, any other scam of similar proportions) I would like to take
one or two steps back and try to figure out why tempers are boiling so
high in this particular case. 

True, tempers will always rise in the critical days that decide the
success or failure of a major scam attempt. But at the moment a lot of
bad feelings are not centered around the scam itself at all, but
around its preliminaries and its aftermath. My impression is that
these problems are not connected to the scam at all, but to a
different development that happened during the recent elections: a
strong shift towards a political, roleplaying style of playing nomic,
mixing in an unclear way with the traditional athmosphere of Agora,
where the metagaming approach dominates and many (metagame) issues are
discussed freely.

Let me make clearer what I mean by political roleplaying vs. 
metagaming.


II. Metagaming vs. Roleplaying Approach
=======================================

On the metagame level, which traditionally dominates Agora, 

1. Officers invest a lot of time and effort to keep the game
going. Running for office, and holding office, is in fact, and is
generally considered to be, a service to the Agora community.

2. Players freely discuss the background of their actions:
motivations, intentions etc are not secret (except, for a limited
time, if secrecy is needed for the success of a scam; but even in
these cases after the success strategy and other "behind the scenes"
issues are publicized and srutinized freely.) In fact, these
discussions are an important part of enjoying the game for some
players.

3. Successfull (or spectacularly failing) scams, (ab)use of loopholes,
and other "creative" and unexpected ways of making things happen are
accepted, and even applauded and enjoyed by all players. This includes
things that would be seen as unacceptable, objectionable or at least
in very bad taste in real life (legal or not), like bribery, secret
conspiracies, quibbling and going to the courts over election results
and formalities etc.

4. Losing an election, having a proposal rejected etc is taken in good
humour and not interpreted as an expression of personal dislikes
between players, declaration of personal mistrust or accusation of
misbehaviour by anyone. 

5. Players tend to form their opinions and decide their votes on a
case-by-case basis, focusing on facts, concepts and their ideas of
what an ideal nomic should be like, not on the persons involved. If
any, there are only very temporary alliances between players, and
there are few, if any, personal feuds going on between them (in fact,
players who believe to be on the receiving end of such personal
vendettas tend to leave in a huff fairly quickly...)

This level of playing is similar to what roleplayers call "out of
character" (OOC) or out time level.


On the more political/roleplaying level, focusing on the same aspects
of the game as in 1. - 5. above, 

1. Being an officer gives you power and wealth. To a great degree this
is due to recent changes, most notably the increasing scarcity of VTs
(leaving officers' salaries as the only regular source of income) and
the immediate influence officers can exert on the game due to the
authority given to them by rules (including, but not limited to the
officers' extra votes that have been used in the current scam). These
changes were intentionally introduced in order to emphasize the "in
character" desirability of holding office - even including powers that
were intentionally constructed such that they can be "abused" for the
personal interests of the officer.

2. There is a lot of speculation as to the motives of players - in
fact, many of the recent flames centered around allegations of what
was done by whom for what reason, and whether these (perceived,
constructed or publically confirmed) motives were "honorable", in
keeping with Agora's traditions etc. 

3. Grabbing for power, scamming, being "greedy" (i.e. trying to gain
control of important resources of the game) etc. are regarded as bad
things that must be opposed, and may occasionally even be declared as
dishonorable (while the scammers then point out that they could have
legally taken over the whole game and expect applause because they
didn't). Being on the losing side, seeing the winners rejoice and
enshrine their success in monumental rules etc can be felt to be a
humiliating defeat that cries for revenge, and so forth.

4. In elections, impeachment procedures and other decisions, the
personal honour or integrity of players and/or groups is at
stake. Losses are seen as humiliating defeats, and even attempted
impeachments are seen as personal (occasionally even "OOC") attacks on
a players reputation and integrity. (see paragraph C. of chapter III) 

5. Decisions are influenced by political wheeling and dealing, forming
of coalitions and fractions held together by mutual support (or
feuding) along lines that are partly defined by consent on basic
issues, partly on personal relations, likes and dislikes, and only
occasionally by an agreement on the detailed issues at hand. (Let me
add that this aspect of politics is what gives it such a bad
reputation in large parts of the public.)

This level is similar to the "in character" (IC) or "in time" level of
roleplaying.


III. How to Choose Between the Two Approaches
=============================================

If you look at these different aspects of the game, each of you will
be able to find numerous examples for all the points I mentioned and
for contributions to the Agora mailing lists that treated these points
on an "in character" or "out of character" level. The contributors may
not always have chosen their level of play deliberately; sometimes
they even included remarks that I would classify as IC or OOC in one
and the same statement, and sometimes different players would classify
the very same remarks or actions as IC or OOC. 

On a meta level, of course, the interesting question is: How do we
decide whether to act - or to treat and evaluate a player's action -
on the meta (OOC) or the roleplaying (IC) level?

The main purpose of this essay is to encourage discussion of this
question, and to make some initial contributions. Let me just try some
explanations of how we choose the playing level.


As I mentioned above my impression is that by and large the
metagaming, or OOC, level of playing is the standard in Agora's
traditions. I will therefore focus on some reasons why we occasionally
switch from this detached style of playing to a more personally
involving, role playing style.

Obviously, saying that the metagaming approach is typical for Agora
implies that other nomics, or even some players of Agora, may favour a
more roleplaying approach as a general preference. But in addition, I
can think of the following reasons why even people who usually prefer
a more detached, metagaming style occasionally go for a more "in
character" approach.


A. What's in a Name? or: Rules that Encourage Roleplaying.
----------------------------------------------------------

Often we seem to be influenced by quite superficial guidelines such as
names of procedures and actions. Let me quote just one example:

An "impeachment" is not seen as what it is in the rules of Agora (just
one of many ways to remove players from office, and one of the most
difficult ones at that) but interpreted similar to a procedure which
exists in the US American constitution, with a very different function
and purpose, but which happens to have the same name and some similar
results (removal from office) as the Agora procedure. Aspects like the
officer's personal integrity and honour are not connected to Agora
impeachments at all (it isn't even necessary to provide a reason for
an Agora impeachment); they are introduced into the Agora discussion
merely by the parallel with US politics.

Other similar concepts which are quite neutral, some so much so that
they are really quite useless and empty forms with no real content,
within the Agora rules are "rebellion" and everything to do with
locations. This is most obvious in the requirement that changes of the
rebelling/abiding status must happen "in" a location called "Beer
Hall". These concepts derive their colour and their fun (role
playing!) aspect solely from their names and the real life concepts
they remind us of.


B. Time of Crisis: Off with 'Eir 'Eads!
---------------------------------------

As we all remember from the scams we've seen before it is easy to get
a bit carried away when big scams are getting closer to the "make or
break" point. Players who are involved with the scam want to see their
schemes succeed, and are hurt if someone opposes their plans on an
inappropriate level. Not that you don't expect any opposition at all
(it wouldn't be fun that way) - but usually you do expect to prevail
in the end. It can be frustrating to see your efforts spoilt by an
unexpected move. As long as that spoiling move has some scam or
loophole surfing potential in itself, it is at least fun on the meta
level; but getting opposition that just denounces scam attempts as
dishonourable, on the "IC" level, tends to draw responses on the same
level. In a similar way, some scamsters in the recent scam have been
reacting very adversely, both on the IC and OOC level, to attempts
(IC, in my opinion) of some players to roleplay their (IC)
"frustration" about the succeeding scam via rebellions and
impeachments, because they felt that the attack was aimed at the
scamsters' persons, not the scam itself (a separation that quite
clearly belongs to aspect 5. of IC vs OOC actions).

The frustration to see one's plans stopped cold is something we can
deal with on a detached level if we are talking about small projects,
and projects that clearly happen on the OOC level where we all strive
to build, run and improve a nice little nomic game. But as soon as you
get closer to reaching a big goal, obviously the stakes are higher,
and emotions are more easily triggered - no matter whether the big
goal is a spectacular scam, a big reform project (like PC or plots) or
a new idea elsewhere. The more the big goal lends itself to an
emotional embellishment on the roleplaying level, the stronger this
tendency (remember the Kudo thrashing that Morendil received after eir
"treason" against the New Rishonomic "invasion" attempts?).

On the other hand, those opposed to a scam will also tend to favor a
roleplaying, IC approach. Partly because as soon as the scam becomes
visible, stopping it becomes their "big goal"; partly because scams
often win or fail depending on how well, how fast and how completely
the potential opposition can be mobilized, and drumming up support
against a scam often seems to be easier in an emotional, rhetorically
decorated way.


C. The Game Master's Nightmare: Mixing IC and OOC play
------------------------------------------------------

While I'm not a roleplayer myself, I'm told that one of the worst
things that can happen in a roleplaying group is when players start to
mix IC and OOC information, values and (meta) rules.

This confusion was the reason for many of the recent arguments, I
think - rebellions, impeachments etc played out (at least from the
acting players' point of view) as "in character", but seen by others
as "out of character" attacks on the persons holding office, etc.

I think that blurring the line between IC and OOC makes it extremely
difficult, if not impossible, to discuss matters of game strategy in a
constructive way, and especially so if it comes to questions about the
fairness, adequacy, living up to Agora traditions or the general moral
evaluation of certain game moves. I will not elaborate further on this
point, but would ask the reader to notice that the two approaches to
gaming, esp. referring to points 1, 3 and 4, are concerned with the
very same set of gaming actions, but reach completely different
conclusions as to what gaming moves should be applauded or deplored,
supported or opposed, and generally be considered enjoyable and good
or annoying and bad.



IV. Historical remarks:
=======================
 My involvement in the recent trends towards more In Character playing.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

I have always tried to support rule changes that encourage roleplaying
not as a meta game agreement on playing style, but from within the
rules. For example, this trend has led to the developments sketched in
aspect 1. of the roleplaying approach.

The elections after the recent rebellion then opened up a new avenue
to explore in the direction of more roleplaying, for several reasons.
Some players were disappointed (at the OOC level) about the
rebellion. Without knowlegde of the impending scam, which was prepared
by this rebellion and the following elections, the rebellion seemd
like a rather lame attempt to demonstrate a loophole in the delegation
rules and create a lot of work for the registrar for a very limited
entertainment value.

At the same time, the following elections had candidates for most
offices in combinations that made group based voting patterns a
possibility, as candidates belonging to the Threat were facing
candidates belonging to the Order of the Evil Eye. 

Of course, in hindsight this wasn't a coincidence, at least not from
the point of view of the Threat, who needed to grab both a sufficient
number of offices and some particular key offices, including
speakership, to secure the success of their scam. At the time, I
didn't know this, of course, and being both a member of the Order, and
not a candidate in any election, I decided to play in a more
roleplaying style than usual, making some propaganda to portray the
elections as a struggle against total domination of Agora by the
Threat. 


Now of course I didn't really fear any bad consequences for Agora in
the case that all Threat candidates would win, and I was blissfully
unaware both of the scam that was to follow and even of the
possibility that these elections might be more than the aftermath of a
lame loophole exploitation (sorry to you Threats for not expecting
more of you...). In fact, my impression that these elections were
essentially meaningless, pitting qualified and trustworthy candidates
against each other anyway, was one of the reasons why I chose to try
and spice up these otherwise boring elections with a bit of rhetoric.

My attempts were a big political failure, of course - I did manage to
polarize the situation a bit, but in the end the Threat managed to win
(nearly) everywhere, although the Speaker's tie break was required in
most cases. 


Another attempt of mine to roleplay some more politics failed shortly
after that: after the Threat won several offices right away, and
Speaker Steve announced eir first tie break in favour of a Threat
candidate, I saw two strategies for the Threat (in what I thought to
be just another set of elections): grasp as much power as possible,
leaving the game, and especially the holding of offices and the salary
distribution in a rather unbalanced shape; or try for some more
balance between the groups.

I tried to entice Speaker Steve to follow the latter strategy (by
breaking the remaining two ties in favour of the Order's candidates)
not in a direct, metagaming approach (by simply mailing em and asking
em to do so), but in a roleplaying way: by rebelling, and thus
roleplaying my dissatisfaction with the situation, embellishing this
with the strong rant I added to the message in which I rebelled. 
Whether Steve just broke the ties in favour of the Threat to
make the upcoming scam work, or whether my IC Beer Hall "diplomacy"
simply failed, I don't know, but I certainly didn't reach my goal,
plus I annoyed Steve enough for em to deKudo me...

At the same time, my allegations that the Threat would hold too much
power after winning all these elections (which was not much more than
rhetoric to me at the time, because, as I said, I didn't fear any
destructive game play from the Threats) turned out to be true, of
course, but: only in the sense of the short term, IC meaning of the
roleplaying approach to point 3. above. On a more detached, meta
level, I am more than willing to applaud the Threat, following the
metagaming approach to aspect 3.


In order to be complete, let me add that I am still not sure whether
my voting for the impeachment of the officers who used their officers'
vote in this scam was an undue, dishonorable or whatever thing to
do. It was certainly more in the roleplaying spirit concerning aspect
3., but I am still not sure what was so wrong about it - except that
it provoked reactions from the impeached officers which I never
intended (see chapter III C).


V. Personal Conclusions
=======================

At the moment I am doubly disappointed about the results of my attempt
to roleplay more politics: not only did I fail and the Threat prevail
in all respects, as far as the IC level of playing is concerned; I
also annoyed several players I respect, and would never want to accuse
of destructive behaviour on the metagaming level, in a way that
triggerred the unpleasant blurring of the line between IC and OOC
play, outlined in chapter III C. above. I don't feel I have to
apologize for anything (nor has Sherlock, in my opinion), but I'm
certainly not content with what happened and with the results my
actions led to, and I am sorry for unintentionally hurting the
feelings of Steve and others.

Obviously, the metagaming approach is very deeply rooted not only in
Agora's traditions in general, but also in the minds, and instincts,
of many key players of the game. I still think that the roleplaying
approach has its own merits, too; and I wouldn't want to discourage
other players to pursue such an approach, like Sherlock did so
consistently and courageously in the face of considerable opposition. 

But the fun of roleplaying must somehow be balanced against the danger
of frustrating valuable, and irreplacable, key players of the game
(you know who you are). Ideally, these players will understand that
they have occasionally drawn the line between IC and OOC play
elsewhere than other players, and have interpreted moves as personal
attacks that weren't meant as such. Then we can maintain the open and
friendly athmosphere of Agora, characteristic for the metagaming
approach with respect to aspects 1.-5., while we can still have fun in
times of crisis, going into roleplaying mode for short periods of time
and where appropiate; and, lastly, we can accomodate players with
varying preferences concerning the proportion of roleplaying and
metagaming - this is the biggest challenge for an open nomic, after
all: getting (and keeping) together players with different goals,
styles and preferences and moving somewhere together, having fun along
the way.

The Impeachment Rules contain a very bad bug, one that means that all
the Impeachment Referenda, including the Impeachment of Michael, will
pass if they meet Quorum, which I think they all now have done.

Here's the last paragraph of R1486:

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio is
      2.

'Adoption Ratio'?? That should very definitely be 'Adoption Index'.
It means that all Impeachment Referenda pass regardless of the votes
cast in them, as long as they make Quorum.

Fortunately, there is at the moment another bug which enables the
subjects of Impeachment Referenda to avoid the effects of Impeachment.
Here's the second paragraph of R1486:

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

If at the time the Referendum passes, the named Player is *not* holding
the Office, then the Impeachment has no effect. Thus, a Player subject
to Impeachment can avoid it by exploiting the Delegation Rules, in a manner
similar to the bug in the Delegation/Revolt Rules.

The members of the Threat have therefore made plans to cross-Delegate
their Offices so as to avoid holding them at the time the Impeachment
Referenda pass. Our main concern is for Registrar Michael, an innocent
victim in all this.

I therefore consent to be Delegated Registrar, and I ask Sherlock to
delay announcing the results of the Referenda until Michael has had
a chance to Delegate his Office, either to me or to some other Player.

Due to a bug in Rules 1434/1486 it appears that the Impeachment Referenda
will all pass regardless of the votes FOR and AGAINST.  I will shortly
proto a fix.

If the votes were truly against me, I would probably consider facing the
music, or resigning.  However, I believe none of the Impeachment Referenda
could now achieve a 2:1 ratio in favor, and that justice would not be
served by my removal.  Therefore I will avoid this outcome by the best
means that I have, and to help others do so.


H. Registrar Michael,

I hereby Delegate the Office of Clerk of the Courts to General Chaos, for a
period commencing at the time the good General consents to be so Delegated,
and concluding at 00:00:00 GMT, Thu 19 March, 1998.

I hereby consent to be Delegated Speaker-Elect and Chancellor.  I also
consent to be Temporary Accountor.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Threat Vizier
