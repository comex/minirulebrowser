Proto-Proposal: The Proposal Queue 1.3

Amend Rule 1036 ("Making And Distributing Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall assign to it a Number as specified in other Rules.
      E shall then place this Proposal on the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are listed
      in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero. 

      The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This 
      publication shall include the number, title, priority, and time
      of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue. If a Proposal's
      Priority has changed since the Queue was last published, then
      this change shall also be published. The actual text of the
      Proposals in the Queue need not be published. 
      
Change the title of Rule 1036 to "The Proposal Queue"

Create a rule, with title "Distributing Proposals", with text:

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch 
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order 
      given by the Queue. 

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the 
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the 
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect. 

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

Create a rule, with title "Increasing Priority", with text:

      An Entity may increase the Priority of a proposal by notifying
      the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of P-Notes to
      the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the Priority of 
      the Proposal is increased by one, provided that this transfer
      is not executed for any other purpose.

Create a rule, with title, "Promotor's Privilege", with text:

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.
 
Create a rule, with title "Decreasing Priority", with text:

      Every month, as soon as possible after the beginning of the
      month, the Promotor shall decrement by one the priority of all 
      Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a 
      month previously.

      If the Priority of any Proposal falls below zero, then it 
      shall be set to zero.

Create a rule, with title "Discarding Proposals from the Queue", with
text:

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue 
      which has zero Priority and has been in the Queue for more
      than a month, then the Promotor may, at eir discretion, remove 
      this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove that
      Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor that e 
      does so.

[Comment: Remove the old Petition Fee system]

Repeal Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals")

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1723 ("Sanity") by replacing the text:

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal, and it
      is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three.

with:

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

Amend Rule 1724 ("Emergency Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted 
            explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify
      the Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

Change the title of Rule 1724 to "Urgent Proposals".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted a Proposal which was adopted during the previous
      Week.

[1.0: Basic idea of the Queue.]
[1.1: Remove Petition Fees. 
      Add means for removing proposals from the Queue. 
      Added requirement for the Queue to be published.
      Require distribution to be explicitly marked (so that the
      Promotor can publish the contents of the Queue without actually
      "distributing" them.)]
[1.2  Changed "Player" to "Entity" in "Increasing Priority"
      Changed "Emergency Proposal" to "Urgent Proposal"
      Plato-Pragmatised "Decreasing Priority" a bit]
[1.3  The Promotor should distribute exactly one batch per week.
      Changes in priority are published.
      Changed R833 to match Steve's proposal.]

It was; I felt that Trustees were having enough problems as it was
that I should not make it harder on them, so I preferred to point
out possible objections and let each follow eir own conscience.

      Chuck becomes eligible to Judge CFJs again.

1/18  Kolja A. becomes a Boor for Proposal 3668.

1/19  Chuck attempts to admit eir own COE regarding Harlequin's Win.

1/20  Chuck claims that all Players except emself are guilty of the
        Infraction of Delayed COE Response for failing to respond to
        eir COE regarding Harlequin's Win.


ERRATA
------

An Ackanomic CFJ claims that Malenkai did not deregister.  If judged
  true, then Malenkai is still InterNomic moderator, and his attempt to
  appoint Uri Bruck his successor was ineffective.  (It has indeed been
  judged true, but that verdict also means that Malenkai is still
  Ackanomic Clerk of the Courts, and thus that the judge delivering the
  verdict was selected illegally by the Clerk-of-the-Courts-if-
  Malenkai-were-not-a-player.)

I submit this Proposal and pay its Petition Fee.


Proposal:  Plots


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      A Plot's owner may give the Plot to any other consenting entity.

[Bank-owned Plots are traded by the Chancellor on its behalf.]

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures are
      initially owned by the Bank.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs to that
      Player.  In addition, e shall order the Cartographor to create 5
      Structures and give them to the Player; the Cartographor shall do so as
      soon as possible after being so ordered.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.  For each Player, 5 VTs, 5
P-Notes, and 15 Ergs are created in that Player's possession.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank (if the new Type
      is defined by the Rules) or the Maintainer of the new Type's Blueprint
      (otherwise).

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
      shall execute a Payment Order for half the old Type's price (rounded down)
      to the Structure's owner, from the Bank (if the old Type is defined by the
      Rules) or the Maintainer of the old Type's Blueprint (otherwise).

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      Each Structure has a Maintenance Fee that becomes due at the beginning of
      each month.  When due, the Maintenance Fee for a Structure is paid when an
      entity successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of that
      Structure's Maintenance Fee, provided that e indicates clearly that the
      Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Maintenance Fee for that
      Structure.

      One week after a Structure's Maintenance Fee becomes due, if it has not
      yet been paid, then it becomes delinquent.  As soon as possible after this
      happens, the Cartographor shall destroy that Structure.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall report the Production of all Structures.

      When the Cartographor reports the Production of a Structure for a given
      Nomic Week, a number of units of the appropriate Currency are created in
      the possession of the owner of the Plot to which the Structure is
      assigned.

      Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered to be two
      players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and any
      Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead given to
      its owner.

      Only one Vatican may exist at any time, and it is always owned by the
      Bank.  Its Production is a number of Indulgences equal to the number of
      Blots issued and not vacated during the previous Nomic Week.

A Structure is assigned to Area 42 and becomes the Vatican.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      A Type of Structure exists only if it is specifically defined in the Rules
      or in a Blueprint.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle         none       none         none
        Farm         4 Ergs     2 VTs        1 Erg
        House        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
        Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
        Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg
        Vatican      none       special      3 Ergs

Create a new Rule titled "Design of Blueprints" and this text:

      A Currency not Minted by the Bank may be associated with a type of SLC
      known as a Blueprint.  A Blueprint indicates the properties of a Structure
      that produces units of the Currency associated with the Blueprint.  The
      Blueprint's Maintainer is the Mintor of the associated Currency.

      A Blueprint can only be created through an Application to Create a
      Blueprint. Such an Application must contain the following information:

        * The name of the Type of Structure defined by the Blueprint.
        * The type and amount of Currency produced by this Type.
        * Any changes to the amount of Currency produced by this Type due to its
            Adjacencies to other Structures.
        * The Price of this Type.
        * The Maintenance Fee of this Type.

      The Maintainer of a Blueprint may change its text by posting the changes
      to the Public Forum, and indicating what Blueprint is being changed. Such
      changes may only take effect if the new text of the Blueprint would still
      define each of the properties of the Type listed above.

[This allows multiple Blueprints per non-Rule-defined Currency.]

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it is
      Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Remove other Currency inputs; make P-Notes useful]


Amend Rule 1471 ("Creation and Destruction of Currencies") by replacing the
text reading:

       New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
       Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
       that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
       number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
       added to the Mintor's possessions.

with the text:

       New units of a Currency can only be created by an assigned
       Structure of the appropriate Type to produce that Currency,
       as described in other Rules. 

Rename Rule 1763 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II") to "Intentional
Transfers to the Bank") and amend it to read:

       If an Entity transfers Currency to the Bank and specifies a 
       purpose for this transfer, and the transfer succeeds in
       accomplishing that purpose, the Bank shall, as soon as possible,
       destroy that Currency. 

[Rules 1754 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") and Rule 1763 currently have
  identical text.]

Repeal Rule 1684 ("VT Supply").

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if it is clearly labelled as such by its
      Proposer.  If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing "submitted its Proposal
concerning a given Rule" with "submitted its Proposal concerning a given Rule,
and paid the Petition Fee for that Proposal,".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the Assessor
      shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player who submitted a Proposal
      which was adopted during the previous Week.


Amend Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals") by appending this paragraph:

      All Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Proposal shall be adopted
      unless its Proposal Fee is paid by the end of its voting period.


[Part Five:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

As Vanyel's Trustee, I announced the following plan in the public forum on
13 Jan 1998 09:44:22.

>---------------------------
>Plan for Vanyel's Estate

No objection having been posted to this plan before 09:44:22 on 20 Jan
1998, I am empowered to implement the plan.

I hereby execute the following two Transfer Orders:

   From Vanyel to the Bank, 49.5 VTs.
   From Vanyel to the Bank, 17 Indulgences.

Vanyel's probate is complete.  I suppose Vanyel should now come out of
Probate, but I cannot find any Rule that makes that happen.

In case Vanyel is still in probate and I am still Trustee, I hereby resign
as Trustee for Vanyel's Estate.

At the moment being a trustee is messy because somehow you can't get
your job done if the probate isn't terminal.

Not a real fix, but at least to make things work in an improvised
manner: Could we allow the trustee to declare that the entity in
probate e is responsible for is terminal, without objection?

I am still confused by this probate business, but it seems I can apply
the original plan, anyway, so I'll just try that.

As trustee of Calabresi I hereby

1. transfer 1 indulgence from Calabresi to the bank to satisfy POI575,
and 1 indulgence from Calabresi to the bank to satisfy POI578.

3. transfer 10 indulgences from Calabresi to the bank and 14.5 VTs
from Calabresi to the bank. 

I think that is all that is necessary.

I assume that Calabresi now leaves probate, and I cease to be eir
trustee. If this is not the case, I hereby resign as eir trustee.

All good things must end... I find that I have too little time to play
Agora at the moment (I already have about 30 hours a week too little now
I do not do so...), so I have decided to deregister. I may be back one
day. I think I will be back one day, in fact. But this is it for now,
have fun and good luck!

P.S.: If you want to react on this mail, please Cc: it to me, as I
have unsubscribed from nomic-discussion. I am still subscribed to
the various Public Fora, but I will not be reading the mail I
receive from them very regularly.

If at the moment I am a player, I hereby deregister.

Assessor,

The following are my first votes; I was unclear whether PRESENT
involved loss of any voting tokens, so I did not exercise that option.

Implicit in the following votes are a transfer of the proper number of
voting tokens.

------------------------------------------------------------------
1 VOTE YES - 3672 [Repeal-O-Matic] Repeal Rule 1700
1 VOTE YES - 3675 [Michael] The Rulekeepor should have an Official Report

Alack, would that I'd never dared to fight Insanity
But rather stayed within the bounds of common inanity
CFJ'd and found a Ninny, can I refrain from profanity ?
Despair looms, I'm aghast at this absolute calamity :

Egad, what am I to do with a word such as Yosemite ?
Fling it back to the Judge at a fraction of one gee ?

Fear not, fellow Agoran, Insanity will bring no further Wins;
Greed will ensure it, or inanity, or one of many other sins
Heed no one's profanity, kick the Repeal-O-Matic in the shins
Its Executor will find it a calamity but e might take the hints !

Judge, why saddle me with a word such as Yosemite ?
Killjoy, say ye ? Gee, wonder what you'd do if you were me !

Lest Insanity Rule our game again, let us be prompt to repeal;
Methinks inanity, left unchecked, will far dilute Agora's appeal
No profanity's strong enough to say that I find it a rotten deal
Or calamity more likely to make me (ahem) upchuck a recent meal

Please, Judge, could we not just forget about this word, Yosemite ?
Really, I've been so upset by it, by the end of this Apology I just might fail to mention the word "tree".

Ooops. Sorry, sorry.

> Proposal 3670 (Swann)  AI = 1
> Inform the Assessor whence come yer Votes

Present. 

> Proposal 3671 (Swann)  AI = 1
> Officer's Veto

AGAINST. I'll support this with one additional Vote instead of two.

> Proposal 3672 (Repeal-O-Matic)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
> Repeal Rule 1700

Present.

> Proposal 3673 (Steve)  AI = 1
> Tweak R1465 (Champion's Reward)

AGAINST. There are many other Rules which specifiy actions to take
place at an absolute time; given recent discussion, I want all such
cases to be handled by one Proposal, either by enacting a new
principle of law which clarifies this or by amending all such Rules
individually to get rid of the shoddy language.

> Proposal 3674 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
> Real VT scarcity *now*

FOR, twice. Sounds interesting.

> Proposal 3675 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
> The Rulekeepor should have an Official Report

Present. If the Rulekeepor is reading this, I'll make em an offer; 
tell me how you'd like me to Vote and I will. I do think the 
Officer's Veto is a sound idea. ;)

> Proposal 3676 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
> Evidentiary status of Officer Reports

Present. Might change might Vote on this if someone can recall any 
CFJs where the truth of the information contained in an Officer's 
Report was questioned by a Judge.

> Proposal 3677 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
> Requirement of evidentiary basis for findings of fact

Present.

> Proposal 3678 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1
> Supremacy of the Rules

AGAINST. I like the language and overall intent, but I want to retain 
1513's provision that no law can be binding on a person who has not 
been given the opportunity to be aware ot it, which this removes.

> Proposal 3679 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
> Holidays

No Vote.
