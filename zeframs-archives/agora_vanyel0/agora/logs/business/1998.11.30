H. Promotor, please note; I hereby submit the following Proposal.

Proposal
---
Ruleset Lite

Whereas, the Ruleset is littered with all manner of Rules that are 
never used, or were once used but have fallen upon hard times, or
are obviously an unnecessary burden; and whereas, a Ruleset cleared
of such impediments might impart new vigor to Agora; be it therefore
resolved that :

Rule 1769 (Holidays) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1787 (April Fool's Day) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1750 (Read the Ruleset Week) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1789 (Cantus Cygneus) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1842 (Power of Attorney) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1664 (Rebellion) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1840 (Inciting to Riot) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1834 (Robespierre) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1643 (Statements of Policy) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1623 (Disinterested Proposals) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1723 (Sanity) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1724 (Urgent Proposals) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1792 (Proposal Applications) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1729 (Insanity) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1786 (Proposals Passed By the Narrowest of Margins) shall be Repealed.
Rule 908 (Formal Apologies) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1832 (Failure to Apologize) shall be Repealed.
Rule 651 (Heroes) shall be Repealed.
Rule 840 (The Scamster) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1047 (Patent Title of Zeitgeist) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1528 (Organizations) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1614 (Organization's Names) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1621 (Organization's SLCs) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1531 (Administrators and Their Duties) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1630 (Impersonation) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1547 (Some Organizations Can Vote) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1759 (Organizational Payment Orders) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1533 (Application to Create an Organization) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1397 (Dissolution of Organizations) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1617 (Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1458 (The Notary) shall be Repealed.
Rule 717 (Public Organization Report) shall be Repealed.
Rule 766 (Groups) shall be Repealed.
Rule 716 (How to Form a Group) shall be Repealed.
Rule 719 (Joining a Group) shall be Repealed.
Rule 721 (The Vizier and the Oridnanacekeepor) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1752 (Group Votes) shall be Repealed.
Rule 718 (Resignation from a Group) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1446 (Contests) shall be Repealed.
Rule 1538 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) shall be Repealed.

Consistency : Rule 833 shall be amended by replacing the words "an
Interested Proposal" with "a Proposal". Rule 1678 shall be amended
by replacing the words "an Interested Proposal" with "a Proposal".
Rule 1047 shall be amended by replacing the words "an Interested
Proposal" with "a Proposal".
