H. Clerk of the Court, I hereby submit the following CFJ;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Statement: 
      "Player Macross has issued an Order the text of which is:

       I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain
       from using words that are not spelled the same
       backwards as forwards when issuing any Administrative,
       Judicial, Appellate or Private Orders unless the
       issuing of those Orders is explicitly required of
       'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross."

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Barred: Swann
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Evidence:

[Note:  I am issuing no Orders in this message.]

The following is the message I sent in which I issued the Order in 
question.

I believe that this order is invalid.  Rule 1793/0 reads in part:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

You have here amended an order to require me to take an action and
to refrain from taking actions.  However an order may only do one or
the other, not both.  Thus I believe this order is by definition not
an Order at all.


I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do:

I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross.


This should effectively hold off the dictator.

-Macross

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This and the recent ruling on CFJ 1049 lead to the conclusion that the
Order was indeed issued.

-Macross
