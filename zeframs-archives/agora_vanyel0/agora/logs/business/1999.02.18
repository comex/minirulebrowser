I Call For Judgement on this statement:

      A Player with no debts has effective control over eir Currency
      holdings, even if they have granted Power of Attorney over emselves
      to another Player.

Caller's arguments:

In this situation, the Grantor may dispose of eir own holdings at any time
by revoking Power of Attorney first.

I submit the following Proposal, titled "Legal Briefs", and transfer one
P-Note to the Bank to raise the Priority of this Proposal to 1.


Amend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) to read:

      A Senator may give eir Power of Attorney to another Player for a
      specified time period, by specifying the Player and time period
      in the Public Forum.  To be effective, the time period must be no
      longer than three months, must begin during the week following the
      posting, and the other Player must consent in the Public Forum
      before the time period begins.

      If the grant is effective, then the Player has Power of Attorney
      over the Senator beginning at the specified time.  This grant ends
      when one of the following occurs:

        (a) The specified time period ends.
        (b) The Senator posts in the Public Forum that e withdraws eir
            Power of Attorney.
        (c) Either Player is deregistered or goes On Hold.

Amend Rule 1842 (Power of Attorney) to read:

      While the Rules grant one Player (known as the Holder) Power of
      Attorney over another Player (known as the Grantor), the Holder
      is the sole Executor of the Grantor.

      No Player may have Power of Attorney over more than two Players.

I call for the Appeal of CFJ 1119.  Chuck and Vlad having done so yesterday,
that should be enough to send it to the Board of Appeals.

I also submit the following Proposal, titled "CFJ Tweaks", and transfer one
P-Note to the Bank to raise its Priority to 1.

----- begin Proposal -----

Amend Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) by replacing "Player" with "person".

Amend Rule 897 (Barring Players from Judgement) to read:

      The Caller of a CFJ may Bar up to three Players from Judging that CFJ.

      Any Player whose Executor is the Caller of a CFJ is Barred from
Judging
      that CFJ.

      Any Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that CFJ.

Amend Rule 1562 (Excess CFJs) by replacing this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

with this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      A Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

Amend Rule 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ) to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ or type of CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the
      Courts, specifying the CFJ or type of CFJ for which e wishes to
      be made ineligible.  Such a notice remains in effect until the
      Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no longer in
      effect.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.
