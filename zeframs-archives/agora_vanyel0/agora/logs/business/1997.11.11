I may not be registered, but I am a Player, and Active. Thus I should 
have been eligible for the Indulgence lottery. This is a COE...

1. Former CotC Andre-- do you have any undistributed CFJs or judgements?
Please send them to me.  Thanks.

2. Appeals Board members Andre and Morendil-- please address your decisions
in Appeal 1053 to me.

3. This means I am both CotC and Justiciar.  Thus I resign as Justiciar,
appointing Steve in my place, if he is willing.

I vote for myself for Justiciar, Oerjan for Mad Scientist, and Crito for
Promotor, and Michael for Speaker-Elect.  

I also withdraw from the Speaker-Elect race, to the extent that I can

It doesn't, mainly because R880 seems to use language which bases
events in the present on events in the future.  It says: "for an
appointment to be valid, this Player [the putative new holder of the
Office], must either explicitly and publically consent to becoming the
new holder of that Office within seven days of such appointment, or be
the Speaker."

So a resignation can happen as long as the resigner makes an
appointment.  An appointment is to either the person named or the
Speaker if no-one is named.  But if you name someone, the validity of
doing so is dependent on their agreeing to the position within seven
days.  The resignation rule can actually require us to predict the
future when the resignation happens.

I think this is slightly different from retroactivity in general,
though it looks much the same once someone consents and we
retroactively install them in the office.  For example, who is the
Justiciar now?  elJefe has resigned, but Steve hasn't consented to the
appointment.  If he is to do so in the next seven days, he is
temporarily in office.  If he doesn't, then he's not.

Fundamentally, the problem is that our rule language can express
"impossible" concepts (basing events now on events in the future).
Rather than restrict our use of language, I think this is probably a
good case for a judicial interpretation to effectively rewrite the
rule for us in the interests of common sense and the game's best
interests &c. 

Therefore I make the following CFJ:

  Steve is currently holding the Office of Justiciar.

I bar Steve. 

I also urge Steve not to consent to the appointment until the Judge
has returned their Judgement, and simultaneously urge the Judge to be
quick about returning the Judgement.  This way they have to judge in
an "impossible" situation.  I bar Steve only because I believe that he
would Judge being able to know whether or not he is going to consent
to the appointment, thereby defeating the CFJ's ulterior motive.

Finally, I disagree with Zefram who claims that consent is part of the
appointment process.  The wording of 880 suggests more to me that an
Officer need only specify a successor Player in order to be able to
resign, and that this action takes place regardless of the validity of
that appointment.  (Though I wonder, what happens if you appoint
someone currently On Hold?)

Michael.

The following proposal has just been distributed to the IN mailing
list as INP 351:

-- 
Fix a typo in rule 349 by replacing the string "The liaison of any
member nomic can sent a message to the mailing list" with "The liaison
of any member nomic can send a message to the mailing list". 
-- 

The voting period of our Agora referendum on this will last until Mon,
17 Nov 1997 22:30:14 -0400. 

FYI, this was proposed by me for three reasons:

- to fix the typo

- to collect some IN points for Agora

- to motivate people to find some solution for typo problems.

I tried to keep a record and I came to the depressing result that in this
batch, only 3 Proposals were Protoed: 3581, 3585 and 3596.

As a result, according to my recently posted Voting Policy, I will not be
declaring Presence on 3579, 3582, 3586, 3589, 3590, 3593, 3594 or 3595,
despite this having been my initial intention.  It remains to be seen
whether any of this has an effect on Quorum.  I don't feel I can currently
afford to vote AGAINST just for this reason, maybe some later batch.

Anyhow, here are my Votes and Declarations:


               3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
               5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5  5

               9  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  1  2  3

Oerjan              2F     A     A        A

               4  5  6
  
Oerjan               *


Oh, and I hereby cancel my Voting Policy. Too much work for too little
gain.  That does _not_ mean that I will be positive to non-Protoed
Proposals, just that I won't feel the need to catch every single instance
of them... I'm not sure I got it right this time, even.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I am opposed to P3585, which gets rid of P-Notes.  I think they
can yet be made interesting.  However, the current vote is overwhelmingly
in favor of P3585 (8-1, if I've counted correctly), so I do
not at the moment plan to cast votes against it.  If there are a
few other players who oppose P3585 and are willing to vote
against it, then I will cast 2 votes against it as well.
