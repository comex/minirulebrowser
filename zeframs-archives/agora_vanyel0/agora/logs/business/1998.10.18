As Assessor, it is my job to report Infractions of Failure to Vote.
This is going to be a bit difficult, in the absence of a recent 
Accountor's report, but judging from the last such report, and the 
recent level of spending, I expect that all players should have a Duty
to Vote on Proposals 3794-3795, and so I am going to report Infractions
accordingly. Anyone who cares to dispute this claim can do so.

Also, I notice that "Effective Control" as defined in "A Duty to Vote"
does not take into account your current VT debt. So you can be into debt
well over your head, but with 3 VTs in hand, and you are still liable
to be penalised.

This is probably the way it has to be. It would, perhaps, be too much to
ask of the Assessor if e had to determine every Player's Net VT Holdings.
