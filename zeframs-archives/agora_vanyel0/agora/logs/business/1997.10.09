H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, Disinterestedly.

####
Proposal
A Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: third time lucky, maybe?]

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.
####

I appeal this decision.  The claim made in the Claim of Error
referenced was incorrect; my claim that the Transfer Order attempted
by Harlequin failed to satisfy the POs in question is true, insofar as
that Transfer Order failed to be successfully executed; thus, I was
correct in denying Morendil's claim that Harlequin's Transfer Order
succeeded in satisfying Payment Orders VT1026 and VT1027.

Proposal:  Clarify Judge Eligibility

Amend Rule 911 by replacing this text:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Morendil is Elde's Executor in Probate.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Morendil is Elde's Executor.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

     Either Blob's Executor is emself, or Blob has no Executor.

Reasons and arguments for all of these CFJs:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

Proto:  Plots (v1.3)


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named Plot's
     name Without Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

All Plots are destroyed.

One hundred Plots are created with the names "Area XY", where X and Y are
each digits ranging from 0 to 9.  "Area XY" is Adjacent to "Area MN" iff
one of the following conditions is true:
  X = M and Y-N = 1 (mod 10)
  X = M and N-Y = 1 (mod 10)
  X-M = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N
  M-X = 1 (mod 10) and Y = N


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Bank.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

     A Plot's Owner may change that Plot's name Without Objection.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     When a Plot is sold, its Owner before the sale is known as the
     Seller, and its Owner after the sale is known as the Buyer.

     For a Plot to be sold, the Seller must inform the Cartographor of
     the identity of the Plot and the Buyer; and the Buyer must agree
     to the sale, unless the Buyer is the Bank.

     For a Plot owned by the Bank to be sold, the Buyer must pay 4 VTs to
     the Bank for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

     When a Plot is sold to the Bank, the Cartographor shall pay out 2 VTs
     to the Seller.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly.  However, no Plot
     may possess more than one Mule.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Bank has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Bank.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).  Unless otherwise specified, each Structure's
     Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 2 units of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * all changes in Plot Ownership since the last Report (if any)
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report (if any)
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is
       * all cases of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure


[Part Five:  Authorship]

Harlequin, Blob, and Antimatter become Authors of each Rule created or
amended by this Proposal.

COE denied.  Messages sent to the PF, according to legal precedent,
become effective at the time they reach the PF, *not* the time they are
composed (which is what the Date: header indicates).  I record each PF
message as taking effect at the time on the first Received: line added
by gecko.  The times for the two messages in question were listed in
the most recent Registrar's Report:

|1997-10-04T10:08:11Z (Sat)
|  Kolja A. goes On Hold.
|
|1997-10-04T10:12:02Z (Sat)
|  Kolja A. attempts to Nominate for Ambassador, but fails due to being
|  On Hold.

Whatever order they originated in, they became effective in this order,
and Kolja A. went On Hold before attempting to Nominate.

(Btw, Steve: I believe gecko's clock is a few minutes slow.  It makes
no difference to the ordering in this case, but could become critical
for week- and month-end effects.  Could you try running xntpd?)

It seems that there are VTs in circulation again (although I have not got
any yet :-( ), and I have not received any further corrections to my
Proto.

So, I hereby Propose the following:

>>>>
PROPOSAL
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

Is this the kind of Appeal that needs 3 Players, or is your

In any case: I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1047.

Well, you know how your own software works. But I am curious: how can
you possibly avoid having to keep track of Blob? He is registered,
after all, and is a potential owner of VTs. (In fact, due to a bug
in PC, all Nomic Entities are potential owners of VTs.)

Just to make the point: I hereby transfer 0.1 VTs to Blob. I hope I
haven't just created additional software work for you.

It's useful to have a complete list of Players and their VT holdings.

Murphy, your attempt to Rebel was ineffective, since you were not in

H. Assessor G. Chaos!

I hereby transfer 1 VT to Oerjan, because he hasn't any.

I should have thought of this before...

I hereby execute a Payment Order for 1 VT from the Bank to Oerjan, as
an exercise of my Right of Patronage. This award goes to Oerjan in
recognition of the many fine moments his splendid sense of humour has
afforded all of us, and in recognition of the community service he has
performed in Proposing to Exorcise our Probate demons.

Speaker Steve
