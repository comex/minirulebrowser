I hereby claim that above re-assignment is in error, in that Proglet was
not eligible to serve as Judge for CFJ 1104, due to his not having been
registered to play when the CFJ was called. See CFJ 1046 for the
relevant precedent.

I deny this COE.  The judgement of CFJ 1046 is not relevant as it
addresses the case of appointment of a Justice, where Justices must be
taken from those eligible at the time the CFJ was called (Rule 911).
The relevant rule in this case is that concerning re-assignment of
CFJs, which simply states that an assignment shall be done as normal.
The assignment rules for CFJs do not rule out Players who were not
registered when the CFJ was called.

The assignment of Proglet to judge this CFJ stands. 

CotC Michael.

I reported each of the following pairs as if they were separate POs.  I
now believe that these pairs actually represent a different reporting
of the same PO's.  I claim I was  in error and am now going to correct
this error.  The criteria I used to determine if the pairs of similar
PO's were actually one were:  They had the same amount, Payee, Payor,
Issue Date, and  they had numbers from different numbering schemes. If
there are no objections I will issue a revised Accountor's Report based
on this assumption.  

Note if a PO has two dates, the second date is the date a Transfer
order was issued satisfying it.
