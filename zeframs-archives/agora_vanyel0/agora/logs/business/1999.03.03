Sorry, I should have included the exact text of Andre's Will in conjunction
with that note in my Report - especially since it was sent directly to me,
not to one of the lists.  Andre has since posted it to a-d, but here it is
again anyway:

     My assets are to be divided as evenly as possible among all players who
     either received unemployment benefits or registered during the current
     month.

However, since it's now March, the set of Players referenced by this Will
is probably different than it was in February.  Michael, Crito, is this
sufficient information for the two of you to resolve the issue?

Proto:  Registrar's Report tweaks

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration Due to Silence) by replacing this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

with this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of each Player's status (Noisy,
      Quiet, or Silent) and the most recent date on which each Player's
      status changed.  This list is known as the Blue-in-the-Face Pages,
      and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Amend Rule 1367 (Degrees) by replacing this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall note in eir report which persons possess
      which Degrees.

with this paragraph:

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of which persons possess which
      Degrees.  This list is known as the Gray Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

I find the original Judgement incorrect, and move to overturn it.

At the time Vlad posted eir Voting message, exactly one Proposal numbered
3830 (Blob's "Actions with N Supporters") had been distributed.  However,
another Proposal (Vlad's "The Grand Agoran Tournament") had also been
distributed at that time, and could reasonably be referred to as "Proposal
3830" even though such a reference was not sanctioned by the Rules.

Vlad's Voting message did not clearly identify one or the other of these
Proposals, so did not satisfy the requirements for a Voting message to be
effective.

There is also the issue of the Judge's denial of the Motion requested by
the Caller.  I cannot find any provision for Appealing the handling of a
Motion.  However, it appears that the Board of Appeals may execute anything
whatsoever as an Appellate Order, by majority agreement.  Is this the
intended mechanism for allowing the handling of a Motion to be overturned?

I state for the record that I would support an Appellate Order requiring
the vacation of Payment Orders avt083 and avt085, should one be issued.

I find that the original Judgement is incorrect, and move to reverse it.

Even while Power of Attorney is in effect, Kolja is still able to act as
emself, because e *is* emself; e does not need the power of Executorship to
do so.  Kolja is able to spend eir Currency, or lock it up in a Contest
which
prohibits Steve from doing anything to it on behalf of Kolja.  It is my
opinion that this imposes no significant penalty.  It is also my opinion
that
Steve's ability to beat Kolja to the punch does not deny Kolja effective
control; effective control need not be exclusive.

re-instating the Duty to Vote penalties vacated as a result of the
original judgement.
