It probably won't come down to me, but I decline to be Speaker-Elect

Seems I forgot about one of my duties.  I hereby report that
I am guilty of the Infraction of Seriousness, with a penalty
of 0.5 VTs.  I would like to add that I am sorry for my Infraction,
and I note as a mitigating circumstance that it was merely
forgetfulness on my part, and not any Serious intent.

Having said that, I name General Chaos to be this week's Silly Person.

As I graduated from undergraduate college this May, I will shortly be
losing this account (blahedo@quincy.edu), and the associated webspace.
Rushing in to fill the gap, I have already acquired my grad school
account, which should take over mostly seamlessly.  The things to note
are that my email address is now dpb@cs.brown.edu, and the Archives are
now located at http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/agora/.  The old pages
will point to the new ones for at least a month, and the email account
should forward indefinitely.  Most of the stuff for the archives has
already been moved, but I'm taking advantage of this opportunity to
upgrade some things that badly needed it, so things'll be a bit confused
for a short while.

We now return you to our regularly scheduled programming.

I vote for Harlequin as Mad Scientist. He's been campaigning for the Office
for so long, and with continuing enthusiasm, I think he deserves a go.

The Mad Magician Murphy refuses to bow to the demands of the Ignorant
Masses.  After all, if eir qualifications for the Office of Mad Scientist
aren't blindingly obvious enough already, no amount of pontificating is
going to make them so.

Hmpf.

I thought I distributed these, but as I haven't received any votes and
can't find any evidence that I did, it's possible that I did not, or
the message got eaten somewhere.  Does anyone recall if I sent them
out?

I hereby Execute the following Application to Submit a Concurring
Opinion on Morendil's Judgement of CFJ 928:

============================================================================
We agree with the Caller, General Chaos, and the Judge, Morendil.
that Proposal 3482 did not cause any Currency Transfers to legally
take place. This can be certainly concluded, and concluded alone,
from the second of the arguments given by the Caller, namely, that
the Proposal did not and could not meet the requirement in R1472(d)
that some Rule specify a Player to detect and report the transfers it
sought to effect. However, we would like it noted that the question 
of whether, in the absence of this requirement in R1472(d), the
Currency Transfers in P3482 would still have been ineffective as
the Caller alleged and the Judge accepted, or whether on the other
hand, the authorization granted by R594 for Proposals to alter Nomic
Properties is sufficient to count as specific authorization to cause
Currency Transfers, is a question that has not been definitively
settled in this CFJ.

Signatures: Steve, Murphy, Eljefe, Michael, Crito
