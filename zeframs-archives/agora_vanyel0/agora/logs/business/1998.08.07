In granting this motion, you will also need to make the (Judicial)
Order to Annotate the rules.

Michael.
<<

Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that was implied in my granting the
motion. Is this better:

I hereby execute a Judicial Order requiring the rulekeepor to annotate
R1567 with the statement of CFJ 1101 (and, if the rulekeepor considers
it useful, with the final judgement of this CFJ after the appeal
process).
