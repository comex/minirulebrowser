PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Return of Points.

     Preface: One of the things the economy needs is an encouragement 
     for people to spend the currencies that the game provides.  There 
     used to be an encouragement for both making Proposals, and for 
     Voting.  They were called Points, and could make you win the game.  
     The problem with points was that they became a currency (with the 
     EOG reset caused a lot of bizarre transactions), they were anti-
     pragmatic with dozens of what Scott would term "automagical" 
     transfers, and they were linked to an End of Game event upon which 
     dozens of other events depended (Speaker Transition, Win Tokens, 
     Blots, re-registrations) which meant uncertainties in points had a 
     cascade effect whenever a win was involved.  None of these problems 
     has anything to do with the concept of points themselves, they were 
     all problems with how the concept evolved into in the context of 
     Agora.

     This Proto is an effort to return a Scoring System to Agora, one 
     that is pragmatic and driven by Player actions.  There is some 
     analogy here with how currencies are currently handled, it also is 
     a small scale example of how I would like Officer Reports to be 
     handled eventually.  Please note, I purposely never define "points" 
     as an entity in and of themselves, this is to prevent Players from 
     arguing that the possibility of a negative Score is somehow 
     illogical, and to avoid all the BS involved in the creation and 
     destruction of something that shouldn't be an independent entity.


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Points and Scoring)

     Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value known 
     as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an integer.  If 
     the rules specify a non-integral change in a Player's Score, that 
     change shall be rounded to the nearest integer before being 
     applied.

     Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or loss of 
     Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that number is to be
     added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number of Points means 
     that number is to be subtracted from a Player's Score. In this 
     context, the term "Points" is only used to reference changes in a 
     Player's Score.

     This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with Points 
     and Scoring.

{Comment: This is an attempt to initiate a Scoring system that does not 
          imply the treatment of Points as entities.  There's no talk of 
          transfers, creations or destructions.  "Points" as a term is 
          relegated to being a synonym for a Score change.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: the Scorekeepor)

     There is an Office of Scorekeepor whose salary is twice the Basic 
     Officer Salary.  The Scorekeepor shall keep and maintain a record 
     of the current Scores of each Player.  The Scorekeepor's Official 
     Report shall include the Scores of every player, the changes in 
     those Scores since the last report, and the reasons for those 
     changes.  E shall publish this report in the Public Forum at least 
     once a week.

{Comment: Fairly straightforward.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Winning Scores)

     If any Player reaches a Score of 100 or more, then the Player who 
     has the highest Score and no win-preventing conditions is Eligible 
     to Win the game.  In the case of a tie for the highest such Score, 
     all such Players are eligible to Win.

     The Scorekeepor must announce this event in the Public Forum as 
     soon as possible after it occurs.  Eligibility for Winning shall 
     be determined at the time of the Scorekeepor's announcement.

     This announcement initiates the Endgame Procedure.  At the end of
     this Procedure, if the Scorekeepor's announcement was not
     successfully Challenged during the Endgame Proceedure, the
     Scorekeepor shall announce that all those Players who are still 
     Eligible to Win have won.  Upon the Scorekeepor's announcement, 
     those Players shall Win and all Players' Scores shall be set at 
     zero.  The Scorekeepor must order this Score change.

{Comment: When someone reaches 100 points, someone wins (not necessarily 
          the same someone)  there is probably some explanation needed 
          for the Endgame Procedure--  there should be a chance a) for 
          Players to challenge the announcement with a COE, and b) for 
          those with high scores to try and buy off win-preventing 
          conditions (i.e. Blots)}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Endgame Proceedure)

     When the Scorekeepor announces a Player is Eligible to Win e 
     initiates an Endgame Procedure.  During an Endgame Procedure no 
     changes to any Player's scores are permitted.  This rule takes 
     precedence over Rules that would allow these changes to be ordered.

     The Endgame Procedure persists one week, unless, during that week, 
     there is a Challenge of the Scorekeepor's announcement.

     If there is a COE or CFJ on the Scorekeepor's announcement it is 
     not a Challenge of that announcement unless it alleges an error 
     that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

     If there is such a COE on the Scorekeepor's announcement, and the 
     Scorekeepor admits the error, then the announcement is successfully 
     Challenged and the Endgame Procedure ends immediately.  If the 
     Scorekeepor denies the error, the Challenge is not successful and 
     the Endgame Procedure continues as if there were no COE.

     If there is a CFJ issued during an Endgame Procedure which alleges 
     an error that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win, then the 
     Endgame Procedure shall persist until a Judge issues a ruling.  If 
     the Judge finds that there was such an error, then the 
     Scorekeepor's announcement is successfully Challenged and the 
     Endgame Procedure ends immediately.  If there is any other ruling, 
     then the Scorekeepor's announcement was not successfully Challenged 
     and the Endgame Procedure proceeds as if there was no such CFJ, and 
     if it has been more than a week since the Scorekeepor's 
     announcement, the Endgame Procedure ends immediately.



Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Changing a Player's Score)

     A Player's Score is the Score reported by the Scorekeepor.  A 
     Player's Score changes only when the Scorekeepor records the 
     change.

     The Scorekeepor shall only record changes when a Player empowered 
     by the Rules to order such a change so orders eim. When the
     Scorekeepor is so ordered to make a change e must do so as soon as 
     possible.

     The Scorkeepor shall not record any changes ordered to the Scores 
     of non-Player Entities.

     A Player's score is correct when it reflects all changes mandated 
     by the Rules and ordered by the appropriate Players.  A Player's 
     score is incorrect when it is in error, reflects changes that were 
     not ordered as mandated by the Rules, or fails to reflect a change 
     that was ordered as mandated by the Rules.

     A COE or CFJ can be issued alleging that a Player's score is 
     incorrect.  If such a CFJ or COE finds that the Score was 
     incorrect, then the Scorekeepor must order that Score to be changed 
     to the correct Score.

     If the Rules mandate a change in a Player's score, and do not 
     empower a Player to order that change, that change shall not be 
     included in any determination of a correct Score.

     The effect of ratifying the Scorekeepor's report is to render all 
     Scores listed in it as correct.

     This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that attempts to specify a 
     Player's Score.


{Comment: This is an attempt to have a completely pragmatic Officer's
          Report.  The Scores are what the Scorekeepor says they are.  
          (Another reason for the Endgame Procedure, the Scorekeepor can 
          illegally give someone a Score of 100, but then the Player's 
          have a week to get a CFJ together, nullifying such a win.)}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Ordering Changes in a Player's Score)

     When a Rule states that a Player's Score must change, and specifies 
     a Player who is empowered order this change, that Player then must, 
     this as soon as possible after the Rules mandate the change, order 
     the Scorekeepor to make this change. This order shall be a message 
     to the Scorekeepor naming the Player subject to the Score change 
     and the magnitude of that change.

     A Player is empowered to issue such an order only if the Rules 
     specify e must order the change.


{Comment: This is partially lifted from the Currency Rules, but it's in
          a simpler form since there's no conceit about virtual tokens 
          running around being created and destroyed, going from Player 
          to Player or to the Bank and back.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: The Omnibus Scoring Rule)


     In any week that at least one Rule Change Proposed by a Player is 
     adopted, that Player shall gain three Points.  The Rulekeepor must 
     order this Score change.

     In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e 
     gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player wins an Election, e shall gain five Points.  The 
     Vote Collector for the Election must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player becomes Speaker, e shall gain three Points.  The 
     Registrar must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e shall 
     gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player Judges a CFJ, e gains three Points.  The Clerk of 
     the Courts must order this Score change.

     Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The 
     Herald must order this Score change.


{Comment: I think it's easier on everyone to have a single Rule that
          lists what causes Score changes, rather than going around 
          amending half a dozen Rules. I also tried to keep it so there 
          was only one Score-Changing event per Officer.}
