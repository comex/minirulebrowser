Results of INP 347:

For: Ackanomic

All other voting members abstained.

Proposal is accepted; Agora scores 2 points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a new rule with the text enclosed in ###:

###
InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. 

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal. 

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote. 

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.

###

Remarks: 

- Note that 309 (voting period ends before the full two weeks'
time if all nomics have voted) cannot stop InterNomic from voting. In
fact, at the moment, with InterNomic eligible to vote but not doing
so, the second sentence of 309 never applies at all.

- The last two paragraphs are needed because 332 does not make it
clear who will actually cast a valid vote (= "send a message to the
moderator" according to 207) for InterNomic.

- Note that the moderator is not "voting for" IN in any sense; it's
just that someone has to do it, and the moderator is the only one with
the necessary information. A choice or free will of the moderator is
not involved, however. 

- As a side effect, this will encourage IN member nomics to vote
early, so they can influence IN's vote.

PROTO EP-2
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

Most Honorable Archivist!

Rule 1586 represents the enactment into law of Game Custom established
by a Judgement.  Could you please locate that Judgement for me?  (I
believe it was by Michael, and was related to the Mousetrap Scandal,
although I may be mistaken.)

Thank you!

I'm going to COE this as well, on the grounds already raised. Calabresi
was not registered when the original CFJ was called, and so was ineligible
to serve as a Judge, He is therefore ineligible to serve as a Justice
under R911(iv).
