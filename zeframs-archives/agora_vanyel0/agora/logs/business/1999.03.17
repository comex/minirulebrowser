I see. You could vacate the Order yourself Without Objection, you know.
But since you asked, acting on behalf of Kolja as his Executor, I hereby
vacate the Judicial Order he granted in connection with CFJ 1101 to
Annotate Rule 1567, and Order the Rulekeepor to remove the Annotation.

My, R789 looks bad. What if the Judge of the original CFJ is no longer a
Player? I guess you'd vacate the Order yourself Without Objection, then.
But even so, it's an ugly and convoluted set of provisions. I think I'll
support General Chaos' Proposal to repeal the Rule.

Hmm.  In reviewing this case for Appellate Orders, I notice that the original CFJ statement makes an assertion which I think is false.  Shame on me for not noticing this prior to publishing my decision.  The last clause states that the relevant POs are invalid and should be vacated.  In fact, if the preceeding clauses are true, then at least one of the relevant POs are invalid but should be amended, not vacated (since Vlad never paid eir PO).  If the preceeding clauses are false, of course, then the POs are valid and should not be vacated.  So, no matter what, one clause of the statement is false.  Well, we can't overturn an Appeal and the decision speaks to the spirit of the CFJ anyway, so I'll just go ahead and issue orders appropriate to the service of justice, with the consent of one or more of my fellow Justices:

1.  I hereby order the PO labeled VT670, in the Accountor's report of 15 March 1999, to be amended by replacing the amount of 3.6 VTs with 2.4 VTs.

2.  I hereby order the PO labeled VT671, in the Accountor's report of 15 March 1999, to be vacated.  (Note: it has already been satisfied.)

3.  I hereby order the Clerk of the Courts to pay out .84 VTs to Blob.
