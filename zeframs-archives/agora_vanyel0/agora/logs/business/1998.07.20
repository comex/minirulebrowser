H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following two Proposals, paying 2 P-Notes to raise
the Priority of each of them to 1:

####
Proposal
Extend the Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: The secret voting experiment seems to be working reasonably
well. I'd like to extend it another two months. Note that this quite
independent of the issue of Presence.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by Vote
Collectors), 1625 (Secrecy of Votes) and 1764 (Public Voting) each be
amended by appending to them a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that R1859 (Secret Voting), be amended by
replacing in it the paragraph which currently reads:

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

with a paragraph which reads:

      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this Rule
      repeals itself.

####

####
Proposal
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

####

I apologize for my low level of activity.  I've been in the middle
of moving to America, and my computer is still delayed in shipment.

I hereby become Noisy.
I hereby go On Hold.
