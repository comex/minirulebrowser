I call for the Appeal of this Judgement.  There is of course considerable
game custom to the effect that any message to be sent to a Player may
instead be sent to a list which e is on, or to the Public Forum; with the
exception of the Secret Voting Rule which contains the strategic word
"only".

I guess one could reason that the word "directly" in Rule 1808 has a
similar effect to the word "only" in Rule 1859.  However, this is not
clear; moreover allowing the Judgement to stand would create a Crisis as
it will nullify all previous Transfer Orders made to the PF, and require
Recordkeepors to check which Orders actually were sent to them directly,
an enormously difficult job.

Therefore I think that this issue is definitely so important that it
should be reviewed by the Board of Appeals.

I also think this shows that pragmatisation based on trying to minimize
_sources_ of error, needs desperately to be complemented by minimizing
long time _effects_ of errors.  Minimizing sources of error cannot
possibly work reliably in an arbitrarily evolving environment like Agora.

Well, we _do_ have a system for minimizing effects of errors, the problem
is that it isn't automatic.  Thus on a cynical note, I might claim that
every Officer who hasn't had eir reports regularly ratified (which I think
means all of them) deserves any trouble they get.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

 Hello Agorans,

 After a short leave of absence, I am back and catching up on Agora
related mail. Sorry about not announcing my departure; I ended up 
leaving right after work and didn't have time for that.

I appeal this Judgement.  Judge Lee clearly erred in concluding that
the messages were not conveyed to Swann.  Game Custom clearly holds
that publishing a document in the Public Forum is sufficient to
fulfill a legal requirement to convey it to a given Player.  This
error mandates reconsideration.

Judgement could have serious consequences and thus deserves more
consideration.

Gen. Chaos appeals thusly :

It could be argued that Game Custom to this effect has been
established with respect to the operation of other, older Rules, but
that the wording of Rule 1808 in particular is sufficiently different
from that of such other Rules to make the Public Forum an inadequate
medium for conveying Private Orders. I note Oerjan's argument that
TOs are Private Orders and therefore TOs sent to the PF would be
deprived of their effects according to such an interpretation, but on
the other hand Rule 1808 is relatively recent (late March '98), and
thus Game Custom concerning TOs could conceivably be 'fresh' enough
to be overturned by a new interpretation.

I do agree that the matter deserves fuller consideration, and thus 
join Gen. Chaos and Oerjan in the Appeal of CFJ 1100.
