I report that Harlequin, as Vizier of the Order of the Evil Eye, has
failed to report Time Agent's Iris status as soon as possible, as
required by Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate):

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

and has thus committed the Infraction of Tardiness.  I submit a Payment
Order for 2 VTs from Harlequin to the Bank, and another Payment Order
for 2 Indulgences from Harlequin to the Bank.

I will proceed under the assumption that Time Agent possesses no Irises
or Iris debts.

According to the latest reports for VTs (Accountor), P-Notes (Promotor)
and Indulgences (Herald), Time Agent possesses 0.5 VTs and is the Payor
of the following Payment Orders:

  VT1932 (2.0 VTs to Bank)
  VT1987 (2.0 VTs to Bank)
  POI778 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI785 (3 Indulgences to Bank)
  POI787 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI789 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI790 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI796 (1 Indulgence to Bank)
  POI797 (1 Indulgence to Bank)

I submit the following plan for the completion of Time Agent's Probate:

  * Transfer 0.5 VTs from Time Agent to the Bank
  * Vacate Payment Orders VT1932 and VT1987
  * Vacate Payment Orders POI778, POI785, POI787, POI789, POI790,
      POI796, and POI797

I voted on more than three Proposals last week (admittedly, they were
from different batches), so believe I deserved to have a score change
noted by the Assessor.

I am of the opposite opinion and hereby Call for Judgement on the 
Statement :

   Player Morendil did not commit the Infraction of Inciting to Riot.

R&A :

The Rule states "Any Player who *is* Rebellious continually for a
period in excess of one month" (emphasis mined), not "Any Player who
has been". Further, the clause "upon the report of the Infraction the
Player becomes Abiding" seems to indicate that the report of the
Infraction must occur when the relevant Player is still Rebellious. 

Further, I note that Infractions are defined thusly :

Rule 1812/0 (Power=1)
Notices of Infraction

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

Infractions are of two kinds : actions and failures to perform an 
action. The determination of penalties for is as defined as follows :

Rule 1814/0 (Power=1)
Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

If the Infraction of Inciting to Riot results from "performing an
action", it is therefore clear that I am not subject to any
penalties; the only action that I performed that could be relevant 
was Rebelling, and at the time I did that no penalties were defined.

If that Infraction results from "failure to perform an action", the
issue becomes a little more complex. The action I putatively failed
to perform was to switch from Rebellious to Abiding within some
prescribed period. The Riot Act defines this period to be one
continous month; however I question that this period can be
considered to have started as of the time I became Rebellious.

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

     [...]

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

The Riot Act was not "available" to any Player at the time I last 
became Rebellious, so I could not at that time have become required 
to switch back to Abiding within one month.

I further question, no matter which interpretation is correct, that I 
'failed to perform' the action required of me under the Riot act. At 
the time of Michael's alleged Notice of Infraction, any such failure 
had been corrected by my becoming Abiding again.
