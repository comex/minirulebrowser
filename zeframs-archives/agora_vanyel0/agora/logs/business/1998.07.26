Past Judgements >= Game Custom >= best interests >= common sense,
generally, and assuming that the first two haven't been overruled
by later Rule changes.

I'm most interested in Notary because I've been doing it anyway for

I have decided that I will not have time in the next few weeks to
be both Accountor and Chancellor, and I believe that Michael will
make a fine Chancellor, so I hereby step down from this Election.
