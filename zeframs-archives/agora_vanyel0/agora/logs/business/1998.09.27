I claim that this is in error, in that Murphy did not initiate an
Election for Registrar in his message of Sep 24. Here is that message:

I think this message shows that Murphy initiated the Registrar Election
on Sep 18, even though we didn't find out about it until Sep 24. Since
Murphy begins his message by saying in effect that he initiates (ie on
Sep 24) a Registrar Election if and only if he hadn't already, and since
he had alrwady initiated an Election on Sep 18, the Sep 24 message does
not initiate a new Registrar Election.
