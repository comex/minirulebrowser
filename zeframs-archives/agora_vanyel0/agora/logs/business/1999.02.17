Hmm, I'm not sure I believe it.  I believe there are two issues worthy
of exploration: 

1.  If the Judge believes he has a right to judge CFJs as if he were
    Kolja, then he should equally believe that the notion of
    "effective control of an asset by Kolja" should translate to
    "effective control of an asset by him", as R1478 effectively says
    that he is to be treated in all respects as if he were Kolja.

    The only doubt in my mind is that the language of the first
    paragraph of 1478 is permissive rather than requiring.  It seems
    that Executors may be able to act as if they were the Grantor of a
    PoA, but that they might not be required to so act.

2.  Another argument against the judgement in question is that R1478
    does not in itself remove the ability of Players to perform
    actions, even if their Executor is not themselves.

    For example, the definition of Order makes it clear that Players
    can make Transfer Orders, even if they are not their own Executor
    because the language defining Orders specifies that Orders are
    made by Players. (R1793).

    Interestingly, while R1817 requires the Recordkeepor of a Currency
    to abide by valid orders (i.e., one with a well-specified source,
    destination and amount, and not purporting to satisfy a
    non-existant PO; see R1598) made by the Executor of an owner of
    Currency, it does not forbid the Recordkeepor from obeying valid
    transfer orders made by others.

    I suggest that Accountor Crito can now make a valid transfer order
    specifying the transfer of 100 VTs from the Bank to himself, and
    that as this is valid, he is then perfectly within his rights to
    record it.  Nor do I believe that R1011 would provide the Bank
    with any protection as Crito would be robbing it in accordance
    with a procedure specified in the rules; namely that of how to
    note the effect of Transfer Orders. 

    It remains an interesting question as to whether or not someone
    who can make TOs but who is not guaranteed to have those Orders
    obeyed is in effective control of his cash. 

Anyway, I hereby call for the appeal of the judgement in CFJ 1119, as
I believe it deserves a little further study. 

Michael.

I agree with Andre's argument, and thus call for the appeal of CFJ 1119.

I gently remind the Rulekeepor that since 3833 passed, and repealed
some Rules, I should get a 1-P-Note bonus (from Rule 974)

I also gently remind the Assessor that since I am in my grace
Period, I get a 3 VT bonus (from Rule 1678). Whoopie!
