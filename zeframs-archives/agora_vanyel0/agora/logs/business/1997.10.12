I hereby judge this CFJ to be TRUE.

There are only two possibilities as to who could be Blob's executor:
Blob and Elde. Elde cannot be eir Executor, since Elde is not a
Player. No other Player could be Blob's executor, since no action
has been taken which would make another Player Blob's Executor. 
Since the first part of the statement ("...Blob's Executor is
emself..." is true, then the CFJ is also true.

Oooooh, I wanted so much to do "There is the Office of
Frankenstein Monster" again... Stupid Frankenstein
Generator. 

Agora Nomic
Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Sun, 12 October 1997
Date of last Report: Sun, 5 October 1997

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 3 and 5, which read:

      This is a Win-Preventing Frankenstein Monster for that Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

I selected sentence 3 to be deleted.

STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1607, which reads:

####
Rule 1607/3 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      There shall exist the Office of the Promotor.  The Promotor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.
####

I selected the sentence

      The Promotor shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 
      times the Basic Officer Salary.

I selected the noun "Promotor"

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary 
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/46 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary 
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
