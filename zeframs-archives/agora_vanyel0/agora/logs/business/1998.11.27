I do't think I've voted on these yet. If I already have, apologies to
the Ambassador, but then the attempted extra votes simply fail, IIRC.

I hereby cast 2 votes for P3808, and 2 votes against P3809.

I vote AGAINST twice. As assessor, I really don't want to have to 
do the extra accounting. And it will stuff up the Denial of Voting
Privileges rules, allowing players to vote themselves into debt for
a month or more.

>    3809 Gen Chaos      1 Ten Days is Too Long

I vote FOR twice.
