Proto:  Plots (v1.2)


[Part Zero:  Authorship.]

The Rulekeepor shall list Harlequin, Blob and Antimatter as Authors of
each Rule created or amended by this Proposal.


[Part One:  Rename Locations to Plots.  Discard Entities having
 Locations and Moving.]

Amend Rule 1706 to read:

     There is a class of Entities called Plots.  Each Plot has a unique
     name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Plots.

     A Plot is Rule-Named if and only if it is referred to by name in
     the Rules.

     The Cartographor is authorized to change any non-Rule-Named Plot's
     name Without Objection.

Repeal Rule 1707.

Amend Rule 1708 to read:

     Two Plots may be Adjacent to each other.  No Plot is Adjacent to
     itself.

Repeal Rule 1709.

[Rule 1710 will be amended later.]

Any previously existing Plots are destroyed.

One hundred Plots are created, with names "Farmland (x,y)" where x and y
each range from 0 to 9.  Each Plot (x,y) is Adjacent to (x+1,y), (x-1,y),
(x,y+1), and (x,y-1).  The math in this paragraph is modulo 10.


[Part Two:  Create land ownership.]

Create a Rule titled "Landowners" with this text:

     Each non-Rule-Named Plot has an Executor, known as its Owner; each
     such Plot's initial Owner is the Bank.

     Rule-Named Plots never have an Executor or Owner.

     A Plot's Owner may change that Plot's name Without Objection.

Create a Rule titled "Buying Land" with this text:

     A Plot's Owner may sell that Plot to another entity by informing
     the Cartographor of eir mutual agreement to do so.

     An entity may buy a Plot from the Bank by paying at least
     4 VTs to the Mint for the sole purpose of buying that Plot.

     An entity may sell a Plot to the Bank at any time, at which time
     the Cartographor shall pay out 2 VTs to that entity.

Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.


[Part Three:  Create something to do with the Plots you own]

Create a Rule entitled "Mules" with this text:

     Mules are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

     A Mule's Owner may transfer that Mule to any Plot e owns, or vice
     versa, by executing a Transfer Order accordingly.  However, no Plot
     may possess more than one Mule.

Create a Rule entitled "Energy" with this text:

     Energy is a currency.  Its MUQ is 1.  Its Recordkeepor is the
     Cartographor.

The Mint has 100 Mules and 10000 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1677 to read:

     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.

Amend Rule 1701 by removing this paragraph:

     Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
     any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Each current Player gains 5 Mules and 20 units of Energy.

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

     Any Mule within a Plot may become a Structure (unless it is one
     already) when its Owner pays the price of that type of Structure
     to the Mint.  Unless otherwise specified, the price is 4 units of
     Energy.

     A type of Structure exists only if the Rules explicitly define it.

     The following types of Structures exist:

       * Farms
       * Houses
       * Mines
       * Churches

     A Structure ceases to be a Structure when its Owner informs the
     Cartographor that it does so, or when it is no longer within a
     Plot.  At that time, its Owner receives half the price of that
     type of Structure, rounded down.

Create a rule titled "Upkeep on Structures" with this text:

     Monthly upkeep on Structures is equal to 2 units of Energy for the
     first Structure of each type, plus 1 unit of Energy for each
     additional Structure, except as otherwise specified.

     If an Owner does not pay the upkeep on all of eir Structures
     within one week of the beginning of the month, all of eir
     Structures collapse and are destroyed.

Create a rule titled "Production from Structures" reading:

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall pay
     out each Structure's Production to its Owner (if its Production
     is greater than zero).  Unless otherwise specified, each Structure's
     Production is as follows:

       * Farms - 5 VT
       * Houses - 1 P-Note
       * Mines - 2 units of Energy

     Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered
     to be two players for the purposes of randomly allocating
     Indulgences, and any Indulgences which would be given to a Church
     are instead given to its Owner.

Create a new Rule titled "Proximity of Plots" and this text:

     A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or
     Church to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 VT for each
     Mine to which it is Adjacent.

     A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms
     to which it is Adjacent.

     A Mine's Production is increased by 1 unit of Energy for every
     two Houses to which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 1 unit of
     Energy for every two Farms to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 to read:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
     salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

     At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
     Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

       * all Plots, and which Plots are Adjacent to which others
       * the Ownership of all Plots
       * all changes in Plot Ownership since the last Report (if any)
       * the ownership and location of all Mules
       * the ownership of all units of Energy
       * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Mules or
         units of Energy since the last Report (if any)
       * what type of Structure (if any) each Mule is
       * all cases of a Mule becoming or ceasing to be a Structure

I disagree.  Committing the Infraction of going on hold as a judge
does not make one ineligible (R1568), nor does being on hold make one
become ineligible.  (R698 does not make people ineligible, except for
the Caller of the CFJ.)  Therefore he failed to judge in time when the
time-limit expired and there was a rule active specifying that this
was a problem. 

(I would claim that once seen as eligible to Judge by the rules, this
status can only change as a result of a rule explicitly noting that it
has done so.)

This is a COE on the CFJ 933 re-assignment, which states that Swann
became ineligible when he went On Hold.

Michael.

I was recently elected Rulekeepor by acclamation, and thus hold
the office in the normal fashion.  This is a COE.  (There
may be other offices with a similar error, because there
were several elected by acclamation; unfortunately, I didn't
keep a copy of the message.)

Admitted; Chuck's term of service ends on 1998-01-01.  I don't think I
kept a copy of the announcing message, so could someone please forward
me a copy?

Claim of Error: I do not think you have created an executable Guillotine
Application. The above fails to unambiguously state what the Application 
(a body of text) is, or that it is itself that Application.

I hereby call for the Appeal of the Judgement of CFJ 941, for the reason
that the Frankenstein Rule is not the Frankenstein Monster, and so there
are no mechanisms like those specified.

Re: DIS: BUS: Call for Appeal (Re: OFF: CFJ 941 Judgement: FALSE)

Once more, to the PF.  8)  Thanks for the reminder, Oerjan.

 I will join in the call for appeal of CFJ 941, not
 because I think it necessarily wrong, but because
 I would like to get a clear ruling on whether the
 Frankenstein Rule is a Frankenstein Monster.
