H Herald,

I transfer 1 Kudo from myself to Steve, for showing us how a real scam 
should be done, and showing how feeble my own efforts were.

I was ready to join in with Morendil in calling for Steve's head.
My justification was to be that a deliberate violation of the
Rules (Steve having violated R1497 by forging email headers)
such as this was intolerable--playing a game implies an agreement
to abide by the Rules--certainly, not to deliberately violate them.
We have all known that players could cause problems by ignoring
the Rules--even in something like nomic, where it is less so than
other games, the Rules cannot handle every potential case where people
ignore them.  We have all known that expulsion might have to be a last
resort against such Players.

But lo and behold, upon reading R1497, presenting false information
is not illegal, merely a crime.  When R1497 was first written (I
wrote the first version myself, in response to my own Nile Spice
Black Bean Soup incident), it made it illegal to falsify such
material.  If that were still true, I believe we would be justified
in expelling Steve from the game.

But at some point R1497 was amended so that such activity was only
Criminal, and not illegal.  (I have maintained, and still do, that
the first does not imply the second.)  I weep at such an amendment:
as Rulekeepor, it is entirely legal (although criminal) for me to
post a thousand different Rulesets in a week, as long as I believe
one of these to be incorrect.  I weep at such an amendment, for
R1497 fails to do what it was originally designed to do.

With no illegal activity having taken place, as far as I can tell,
the situation is no worse than my own NSBBS announcement years ago,
so I certainly cannot justify any expulsion proceedings against Steve.
In my mind, the fault of this scam lies in R1497, and not in Summary
Adoption.

Still, there is much to be resolved.  I mean to charge Steve with
several counts of Misrepresentation, and others have raised
questions of the validity of some of the actions involved.  These
issues must be resolved in the courts.  But they cannot be fairly
resolved as long as Steve is COTC: first, with the power to select
Judges, no associated CFJ could hope to get a fair hearing while
Steve is COTC; second, Steve has shown his willingness to commit
Misrepresentation, which throws into question anything published
as official by Steve as the COTC.

I therefore call a Referendum to Impeach Steve as COTC.  As per Rules
1434 and 1486, votes must be sent to me within one week of this
message.  Once such a Referendum has passed, we can begin to resolve
these issues fairly in the courts.  I vote FOR this Referendum.

Chuck

I hereby Transfer 0.6 P-Notes to the Bank in order to reduce the Priority
of the Proposal "Taking Out the Trash".

I do not think such a vindictive Proposal deserves ever to be voted on.

I also vote AGAINST in the Referendum to impeach Steve as CotC.  I do not
expect any Player, certainly including Steve, to intentionally violate
Rule 217 by submitting an ill considered Judgement.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I'll note that, as in RL, legal does not equal ethical. I think
we should hold players to both standards (personally, the latter
is more important to me; I would hesitate to punish a Player who
committed an act of civil disobedience, if following the Rule would be
inethical).

I also vote FOR. And, in the spirit of fairness, I announce that
I intend to recuse myself from any such judgment, since I do not
feel I can give an unbiased judgment.
