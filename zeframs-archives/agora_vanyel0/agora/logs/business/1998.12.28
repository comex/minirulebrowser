I hope this will be valid although we're in the middle of the
holidays. As a nominee, or candidate or whatever, for the office of
Treasuror, I hereby submit a new budget.

I didn't read the Treasuror rule carefully, so I missed the part that
only players receive VTs. Thanks to those who pointed this out to me.

However, I think Andre was wrong when e remarked that there is no
limit on the number of VTs to be shelled out. At least I think this
paragraph defines a limit of 50 VTs overall:

>>
      A Budget is a list of all Players' names, each with a
      corresponding number of VTs. The number of VTs must be an
      integral multiple of the MUQ of VTs, and cannot be less than
      zero. The sum of all these amounts must be less than or equal to
      50 VTs.   ******************************************************
<<    ******

This means, dear Steve, that we will have to cut everyone's VT
holdings down to less than 50% of what the last report had (it listed
overall VT holdings of around 125 VTs). Everyone will lose in this
game. My budget gave 13 VTs to the Order, about half of what it had in
the last report. In a similar way, moat players' VT holdings are
reduced to about half of what they had in the last report. It still
seems fair to me not to punish too badly those players who used and
supported the groups and contest stuff by giving money to these
entities. This is why I kept the (small) VT holdings of groups I'm not
involved with at roughly their last reported level, while I more than
halved the holdings of those I am involved with.

I will have to give the groups' and contests' money to the members of
these, and yes, that makes the Order's members look very good in
comparison to others. But that is just because of the location these
players chose to keep their money. In an attempt to respect Steve's
remark, though, I have given some more VTs to players with large
personal VT holdings in the last report, taking these VTs from those
allotted to the MBC and the Order in my first budget..

So here's my new budget:

          base(3)  (1)   (2)

>Andre       1.5              = 1.5
>Blob        5   + 1   + 1    = 7       
>Chuck       2.1              = 2.1
>Crito       5   + 0.5 + 1    = 6.5
>elJefe      1.7              = 1.7
>G. Chaos    1.7              = 1.7
>Kolja A.    6.6              = 6.6
>lee         3.1 + 0.5        = 3.6
>Macross     3.1 + 1.5        = 4.6
>Michael     2.1 + 1   + 1    = 3.1
>Morendil    1.5       + 0.5  = 2
>Murphy      2.1       + 0.5  = 2.6
>Oerjan      1.5              = 1.5
>Peekee      3                = 3
>Proglet     1.5 - 1          = 0.5
>Steve       1.7 - 1   + 0.5  = 1.2

remarks: 

(1) are deviations from the average, based on similar deviations in
the last report. In this report, most players had around 5 VTs. This
translates into the basis 1.5 VTs for each player. Those who had
significantly more or less than 5 VTs get something like 20% of the
difference in this column.

(2) is a small reward for office holders. Salaries were 0 for most of
the time, but a token reward seems to be favoured by many players.

(3) The base now includes reimbursement for the holdings of groups and
contests players are involved with: 0.2 Vts each for Threat members,
0.6 VTs for X group, 1.6 VTs for MBC members, and (only !) 3.5 VTs for
Order Priests - each of us Priests loses a lot in this.

I have given Peekee 3 VTs instead of the usual basis of 1.5, because I
suspect e'll lose the 5 VTs e gets as a new player due to timing
issues. I would also like to remind all other prospective Treasurors
to remember Peekee in eir budgets, and Peekee (welcome in the game,
btw), remember to vote only for a Treasuror who doesn't ignore you!

Thanks for any further remarks, criticisms etc - I do hope that my
budget will be a simple one, with no hidden features (and no attempt
to catch up with all the old recordkeeping that was lost in the last
few months).

          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.


      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime. A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Cleanup of R.1445

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominations Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating the e wished to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

More Cleanups

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1048 be amended to read:

      (a) A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an
          existing Category to which the new Rule will be assigned. 
          If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's
          Category.  When doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new
          Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new Category.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees
          fit.

      (c) If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must

          subsequent publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      (d) The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
          Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
          Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category.  Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) The Rule Number
        (2) The Rule's Amendment Number
        (3) The Rule's Power
        (4) The Rule's Title
        (5) The Rule's text
        (6) Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) A brief description of each Category
        (2) Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in
          the FLR.

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

Proposal of the Week

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

28. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Eliminate ASAP I

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty
          after the occurence of an event, and specifies a time limit
          for doing so, the failure of that Player to perform the duty
          within that time limit in no way abates that Player's
          obligation to perform that duty, unless the Rule which
          imposes that obligation specifies otherwise.

      (b) Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform some duty at
          least once within any given time interval (such as once each
          week, or each month), and that Player fails to do so, e is
          not obligated to do so twice during the next such time
          period, unless the Rule which imposes that obligation
          specifies otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 208 be amended to read:

      (a) The Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast upon a
          Proposal within seven days of the end of that Proposal's
          Voting Period.

      (b) The Assessor shall not publish the Votes cast on a Proposal
          prior to the time e publishes the Votes cast on:
        (1) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended before that of
            the Proposal in question, and
        (2) all Proposals whose Voting Periods ended at the same time
            as the Proposal in question and which have a lower number.

      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to

Let everyone have a turn

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message
          to the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the
          Proposal upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from Voting
            upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then in
            effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall receive
a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subdivision (a) of this Rule
          twice in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same
          Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this
          right three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
word "zero" with "one" wherever it appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1442, 1765, 1715, 1824, 1660, 1760,

          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.

      (e) Subdivision (d) of this Rule notwithstanding, any message
          sent, by any medium or combination of media, to every Active
          Player so that each Active Player is reasonably certain to
          receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the Public Forum,
          but only if it bears a clear indication that it is intended
          to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

48. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
49. Proposal  (Gen Chaos) AI = 1
Down with Playerism!

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each entity who
      submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during the
      previous Week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
50. Proposal  (Andre) AI = 1
Amendment Applications

Let a Rule be created, with the Title 'Amendment Applications', and
the following text:

  There exists a type of Application called an Amendment Application. 
  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it to the Promotor.
  For an Amendment Application to be effective:

  * it must state that it is an Amendment Application;

  * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies;

  * the Proposal to which it applies must be in the Proposal Queue

  * it must contain a text, clearly identified as such, that is to be
  the new text of the Proposal;

  * it must contain the signature of the Executor of the Proposer of
  the Proposal

  * it must contain the signature of each Player that increased the
  Priority of the Proposal

  When an Amendment Application takes effect, the text of the Proposal
  is changed to the text specified in the Amendment Application.

Furthermore, let Rule 1036 be changed by changing the phrase
  "This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
   time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue."
by
  "This publication shall include the number, Proposer, title, 
   Priority, and time of proposal, as well as any Players other than
   the Proposer who increasted the Priority of the Proposal, for each
   proposal in the Queue."

Honour without Dishonour

Let the following Rule be created with Power = 1;

Herald's Privilege

      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the increase.
      At the same time as e makes this announcement, the Herald shall
      record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of said Player.

[A nice perk for the Herald, and a way to recognize honorable acts
of Players without requiring a 'victim'.  I deliberately left the
allowable justifications to the discretion of the Herald.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
58. Spring Cleaning  (Oerjan) AI = 2
Spring Cleaning

[Corrections of various errors found during Read the Ruleset Week, and
a few found while preparing this Proto.

I have not included capitalization in this, although it is a mess.
That may be a separate Proto.


I also did not try to standardize between "a SLC" and "an SLC".
I _did_ include corrections of "he/his" to "e/eir".

I have divided the Proto into "Basic grammar and spelling", which
should be fairly uncontroversial changes, and "Various", which may or
may not be so.

I'll check what AI this needs at a later stage.

2: Many changes, mostly removing provisions that have become
unnecessary due to other Proposals.  For a while I kept track of newly
introduced errors as well, but I have mostly given up on this - I did
find one by chance during the latest check.  The Proto title is no
longer fitting, alas, but maybe I can get this proposed before it
becomes so again.

3: Final cleanup.]

Part 2: Various


Amend Rule 1023 ('Definition of "As Soon As Possible"') by replacing

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

with

           if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

           otherwise, e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

[I find the current formulation illogical.
2: Steve found my reformulation illogical.  Let's see if removing the
indices helps.]

[2: Rule 1645 was disinfected.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1659 was amended by the Electee reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1626 ("Applications") by replacing the paragraph reading

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

with

      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

[The rest of the Rule defines Signatures Platonically, in such a way
that an Application cannot contain illegal ones.]

Amend Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges") by replacing the paragraph
reading

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

with

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

[The original Rule only requires the penalty to be reported, not the
Infraction.]

If the last and second last paragraphs of Rule 1575 ("Standards of
Proof") are identical, delete the last paragraph.

[They certainly look identical to me...]

[2: Rules 663 and 1564 were repealed and amended, respectively, by the
Omnibus Reform.  Provisions removed.]

[2: Rule 1695 was amended by the Omnibus Reform.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1504 was amended.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 417 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1710 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1763 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

[2: Rule 1713 was amended by the Omnibus Reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1637 ("Wills") by replacing "treasury" with "entity".

[Old terminology.]

Amend Rule 1662 ("The Speaker's Gratuity") by replacing "At the end of
every month" with "After the end of every month".

[The current formulation could be taken to imply that the Registrar
has to pay out at an exact moment.  While there is game custom to the
contrary, this is still not a good formulation.]

[2: Rule 1682 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") by removing the text ", or which would
allow em to reregister".

[The Pardoning system does not work due to this.  It doesn't help
having a precedence clause when the lowered-numbered Rule you are
trying to trump also has one...]

Amend Rule 1747 ("Pardoning Lawlessness") to read

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

["He/his" and some bad timing requirements have been changed.
2: Steve had some comments on the substance of this Rule, however, I
believe that is beyond the scope of this Proposal, so no change due to
this.]

Amend Rule 1439 ("Blots Due to a CFJ") by replacing the text

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

with

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ. 

[Fixes a missing period and makes the Rule PC compliant.]

Amend Rule 1658 ("Tainting the Speaker") by replacing "permitted to
call such a Referendum" with "authorized to call such a Referendum".

[With all the Rule 116/1011 debates I don't feel that the word
"permitted" has enough weight for this purpose.]

[2: Rule 681 was amended.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1590 ("Maintainer of SLCs") and Rule 1531 ("Administrators
and Their Duties") by replacing each instance of "Compact" with "SLC".

[Old terminology.]

[2: Rule 1651 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Acting as Executor and on behalf of Blob, I issue the following
corrections to the Assessor's Report.  (Sorry, I forgot to include
votes sent to the PF after the one's Blob sent to me in eir
transfer package.  Fortunately, this didn't change the results at all.
Also the Herald's and Promotor's reports failed to include the Notary's
