My apologies.  If anyone's interested, this has nothing to do with the
current in-game situation and everything to do with me travelling
a lot lately.

I pay the above VT PO.

I transfer 2.3 VTs to Chuck's Second Savings and Loan Contest.

I am need of 2 Indulgences, for which I am willing to pay 1.5 VTs
apiece.

Chuck
