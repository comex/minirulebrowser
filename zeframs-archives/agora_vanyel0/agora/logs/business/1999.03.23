At the beginning of the month, after Salaries and the ensuing Taxes, we
had 5 VTs/player in circulation. At the end of the month, it appears that
we will have spent a little over 1 VT each. Since salaries currently 
amount to about 5 VTs per player per month we have a distinct imbalance
in inputs and outputs.

Of course, this month's results are skewed by the fact that for two 
weeks we had free voting, in honour of Andre. Put even assuming that
voting had been charged as per usual in those weeks, we would still only
have spent a further 1 VT per player, leaving our inputs still much 
higher than our outputs.

Also, seeing as General Chaos has seen fit to reduce the number of 
Proposals distributed per week, we should assume that the number of votes
cast next month will be even lower. 

So to attempt to prevent this imbalance from continuing, I hereby set the
the Voting Tariff to 1 VT, taking effect as of the beginning of next week.

Sigh. It had been my intention to vote this down again, but lack of
time seems to have gotten the better of me, and Summary Adoption has,
tragically, slipped under my guard.

I say "tragically" because Summary Adoption effectively means the end of
any attempt to impose a cost structure on making Proposals and getting
them adopted, and hence to relate the influence Players have on the game
economically to the time they commit to it. Most Proposals, be they
radical in effect or trivial amendments, will not be Objected to, and
hence will become candidates for Summary Adoption. We can expect large
numbers of such Proposals to be adopted without the expenditure of a
single VT or P-Note. We have in effect re-introduced free Proposal-making 
and voting, by the back door, and with a single stroke undone years of
work elaborating these central concepts of our game. In a way, it is
General Chaos' most impressive coup in his long history of sweeping
changes to the Rules. But never can he have achieved such large effects
by such seemingly modest means. He is to be congratulated on his acumen.

No doubt it will be objected that Summary Adoption is not radical, since
it requires only one Objector to block Summary Adoption. But there can
equally be no doubt that intense political pressure will inevitably be
brought to bear on anyone who Objects to such Adoption, not on the
grounds of the content of the Proposals but because they object to this
bypassing of our traditional institutions. How long can any one person
be expected to hold back the tide under such pressure?

We shall have to see.

I Object to the Summary Adoption of 'Zero Payment Orders' and 'Simplify
Probate'.

**********************************************************************

90. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Zero Payment Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

While Steve's opposition to Summary Adoption is extreme, I am
not unsympathetic to some of his points.  IMO, if Summary Adoption
of a Proposal is unsuccessful, then the Proposal should either be
discarded or moved towards the normal voting procedure.  It is
improper, IMO, to continue attempting to summarily adopt a Proposal
after it is objected to the first time in the hopes of slipping
it by the objector.

Thus, I intend to object to summary adoption of Proposals which
are being put up again after a first attempt failed, unless
a reasonable amount of time has passed since the first attempt.
(An entirely subjective length of time, but certainly on the
order of months.)

Therefore, although I did not object to the first attempt to
summarily adopt "Zero Payment Orders", I do object to this
adoption.

>(How long do you plan to play this game, Steve?)

How long do you plan to play this game, General?  (Hint: if you
continue to abuse Adoption Without Objection in this way, people
might decide the cost of Adoption Without Objection is too high
compared to its benefits and repeal it.)

Normally, I would reattempt Summary Adoption of a Proposal which had
been objected to, had the Objection been based at least nominally on
the merits.  For example, I will not reattempt on Simplify Probate
because the objection was on the merits.  Steve's objection, however,
is dogmatic, having nothing to do with the merits of the Proposal, and
in fact is grounded entirely in Steve's stilted views of Agora's
economy.  Hence my reattempt.

Since I have no desire to tilt at windmills, I will withdraw at this
time.  I do, however, transfer one Kudo from Steve, for hypocrisy
toward his avowed devotion to the creation of "a meaningful economy",
to Chuck, for his amusing reply regarding the onus of political
pressure.

We might as well repeal it; Steve has clearly indicated his intent to
Object to every Proposal, rendering the mechanism useless.  Nor do I
believe that Steve is amenable to bargaining on this position; as far
as I can tell Steve is merely acting to maintain the fief he has
established for himself (notice who has the most VTs and P-Notes
presently).  It would not be reasonable to expect Steve to voluntarily
compromise what he perceives to be the seat of his power.

Of course, this does mean that Steve cannot take a vacation longer
than four days....

I had the opposite deals in mind.

I hereby transfer 1 P-Note and 1 Indulgence to Steve.
I hereby give further notice that my previous trade offers are revoked.
