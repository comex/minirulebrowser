After a couple of recent "accidental" Infractions, I thought the following
proto might be appropriate:

Proto: Appealing for Leniency

Create a rule entitled "Appealing for Leniency" with text:

     A Player who has, in the past week, been reported as having
     commit an Infraction may make an Appeal for Leniency by posting
     to the Public Forum, explaining why e deserves to be treated
     leniently. Once such an Appeal has been made, the Justiciar
     may opt to accept or deny it. If e accepts it, e may order,
     Without Objection, the vacation of any or all POs applied as
     penalties for that Infraction.
