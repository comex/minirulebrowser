I cast votes as follows:

FOR.

>D  3570 Zefram   3 No Win Situation
AGAINST.  I am not ready to remove winning from the game.

No vote. (and no declaration of Presence either).

FOR.

>D  3574 Kolja A. 1 Judicial Cleanup
No vote. I am PRESENT on this Proposal.

>D  3575 Kolja A. 1 Fix Internomic referenda
No vote. I am PRESENT on this Proposal.

Please note that I am not subscribed to agora-discussion at this time.
This makes it more likely that I will vote AGAINST a proposal that looks
wrong and has no explanation attached, like 3576.

Admitted.  The orders are vacated.  The Bank is commanded to pay 8 VTs
to each of Andre, Chuck, Crito, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A.,
Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vlad, Zefram, and elJefe.  

As a consequence of the foregoing vacation, each of Andre, Chuck,
Crito, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan,

Finally, I (personally) transfer 1 VT to each of Andre, Chuck, Crito,
Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vlad, Zefram, and
elJefe, as compensation for having "floofed the goof."

I must have been sleeping when I wrote this. My excuses to all.
I hereby declare my Report of Chuck committing an Infraction which I
made earlier today void, and I hereby vacate the Payment Order of
3 Indulgences from Chuck to the Bank which I made earlier today.

I also hereby transfer 1 VT to Chuck as a recompense for my false
accusations.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1059

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.


======================================================================
Judgement:  TRUE

I judge the Statement to be TRUE.  Rule 1714's second paragraph reads:

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

"Allege" is not defined in the Rules, and its ordinary meaning of "declare
to be true" controls.  To say whether something is "alleged" by a statement
will depend not only on the meanings of the constituent words but on their
form.  Synonymous forms may yield a sentence with the same truth value but
one which differs in what it alleges.

As an extreme example, suppose that Lawlesness were a more complicated
condition, with Rule A saying that someone with over 30 Blots is Lawless,
and higher-precedence Rules X, Y, and Z  saying that someone in the Grace
Period or the Champion's Reward period or with the status of Shogun is not
Lawless after all.  Then an announcement that a player has 37 Blots is not
an allegation of Lawlessness.  Too much information is left out.

In the case that inspired the CFJ, a Herald's report of some number (37?)
of Blots is not a synonym of Lawlessness even in our simpler world.  That
too would not be an allegation of Lawlessness.

In essence, in the situation of the Statement, a reasonable person should
be able to tell from the communication itself that it is saying that the
player is lawless, or in the state of lawlessness, without referring to the
Rules.

"Player X has more than 30 Blots" does not quite qualify.  We need to see
"Player X is Lawless" or some other form of words which on its face means
the same thing.

In case this didn't work before:

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1059

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.


======================================================================
Judgement:  TRUE

I judge the Statement to be TRUE.  Rule 1714's second paragraph reads:

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

"Allege" is not defined in the Rules, and its ordinary meaning of "declare

will depend not only on the meanings of the constituent words but on their
form.  Synonymous forms may yield a sentence with the same truth value but
one which differs in what it alleges.

As an extreme example, suppose that Lawlesness were a more complicated
condition, with Rule A saying that someone with over 30 Blots is Lawless,
and higher-precedence Rules X, Y, and Z  saying that someone in the Grace
Period or the Champion's Reward period or with the status of Shogun is not
Lawless after all.  Then an announcement that a player has 37 Blots is not

I don't know how finicky we're being these days. Do I have to specify
which Payment Order I'm satisfying? Or is that regarded as implicit
in my quotation of the Assessor's message? At any rate: if the above
Transfer Order did not satisfy G. Chaos' Payment Order, I hereby
transfer 9 VTs to the Bank to satisfy that Payment Order. If the
above Transfer Order *did* satisfy the PO executed by G. Chaos, then
this message has no effect.

Rule 1458 (The Notary) was disinfected at Sun, Oct 26 1997 12:05:13
-0600 (CST). I take it that, as Speaker, I have have been Notary
pro-tempore since that time. I remind Registrar Zefram that an Election
should now be held to fill the Office in the normal fashion.

In the meantime, as Notary, I have a number of obligations regarding
recently deregistered Players. Swann, Morendil, Elde and Blob are all
currently in Probate courtesy of R1601, and none has an Executor in
Probate because of the infection of R1458. R1738 requires me to
nominate for each of Swann, Morendil, Elde and Blob a Player to be their
Executor in Probate.

I hereby nominate Harlequin to be Morendil's Executor in Probate,
Kolja to be Elde's Executor in Probate, and myself to be Swann's
Executor in Probate. Players interested in becoming Blob's Executor
in Probate should contact me privately and make me an offer. I will
announce a decision on Blob's Executorship in a few days.

I have a request for information: could former Notary Murphy please
provide me a copy of all current Wills? 

Notary pro-tempore and Speaker Steve
