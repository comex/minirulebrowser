My mistake.  Also, according to the last VT Report, VT2731 is listed under
both Satisfied POs (paid on September 12) and Outstanding POs; I assume that
the latter is incorrect.

I submit the following revised Probate plan for Harlequin:

  * Pay POI083, POI088, POI103, POI106, and POI110 out of eir funds
  * Vacate POI048
  * Reassign VT2666, VT2699, VT2751, VT2780, RVTPO615, RVTPO640 to the
      Order of the Evil Eye
  * Transfer 0.4 VTs and 2 P-Notes to the Order of the Evil Eye

I don't think you've really answered the question directly raised by the
CFJ, which is when the VPs for Proposals 3810-3812 ended. The question
of whether certain votes were legally cast is only secondary to the
Statement. Furthermore, while you say that you've read the arguments,
you don't offer any assessment of them, nor any justification of your
Judgement.

I therefore call for the Appeal of lee's Judgement of CFJ 1110.

I would act on this, and publish the results, but I am pretty sure that
this is going to be appealed. In fact, I will start the proceedings 
myself:

I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1110.

C'mon Lee, this is a major issue and requires a much more in-depth
judgement than this. Your reasoning isn't even grammatical.

I realise now that I called CFJ 1110 prematurely. It didn't occur to me
that it might be argued that the voting period of those proposals might
never end at all.

Now it won't actually make any difference to the results of the voting
whether voting ended at 7, 7.1 or 10 (in fact, afaics, the only difference 
will be that some players may or may not be hit by Failure to Vote POs, 
which should be vacated as soon as we elect our Treasuror.)

So I call for judgement on the following statement:

     The Voting Period of Proposals 3810-3812 has ended.

Arguments:

     Refer to the arguments for CFJ 1110.
