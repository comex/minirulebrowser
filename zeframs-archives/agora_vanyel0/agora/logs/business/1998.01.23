I hereby submit a CFJ.
    "Chuck incorrectly stated that Andre, Blob, Crito, ElJefe, General Chaos,
Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve,
Swann, & Time Agent were guilty of the Infraction of Delayed COE Response."

Barred:  Chuck

I quote Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

None of us were "the Player who is required by the Rules to publish the
information subject to a Claim", as I find no Rule that _requires_ anyone to
publish the information subject to this Claim, therefore the Rule states no
allotted time for a Response from any of us. We have therefore not yet failed to
respond within the (unspecified) allotted time.   :oP

(My first CFJ - I hope I got it right <knees knocking>)

btw is sending this to the public forum acceptable as submission to the CotC or
do I need to send it specifically to em as I have this time ?

I hereby make the following proto:

=======================
ProtoProposal
Repeal Probate

Repeal Rule 1601, 1637, 1738, 1739, 1757.

All entities in Probate are now no longer in probate.  All persons
appointed Trustee for such an entity are now no longer that entity's
Trustee.

Create a Rule reading:

      An entity which possesses Units of Currency or which is
      named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment Order, and which
      does not have an Executor, is said to be in Probate.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

Create a Rule reading:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate, the Notary shall as soon
      as possible transfer that entity's currencies to the Bank, to the
      maximal extent possible.  E shall then destroy any of that entity's
      currencies which cannot be transferred to the Bank.  E shall then
      vacate all Payment Orders naming the entity as Payor or Payee. E shall
      do these things as soon as possible after the entity enters Probate.

      The Notary is empowered to execute Transfer Orders and vacate Payment
      Orders as required by this Rule.


=======================


Why?  The only Fun from probate came with Morendil's ingenious creation of
the Zombies, now made impossible.  Now it's merely Work, and not Fun.

Regards,
-- elJefe

  To whom it may concern,
   I would like to present the following Plan for distributing
ChrisM's Voting Tokens and Indulgences.  I am bypassing Rule 1739 on
the following grounds:

  1.) It seems to provide only for entities who are "terminal".
  2.) Nowhere in the Full Logical Ruleset is "terminal" defined.
  3.) Thus, I have no reason to assume ChrisM to be "terminal", and
      will follow Rule 1738, that states that the Trustee "shall 
      formulate and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the 
      disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate according 
      to the provisions of the Probate Code", avoiding all rules
      which apply only to "terminal" entities.

Thus, unless this Plan is disputed in the next seven days, I will
enact the following...

+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Plan for the Execution of ChrisM's Remaining Currencies |
+---------------------------------------------------------+

ChrisM's remaining currencies total: 9.5 VT's

I'm sorry, but I must object to this plan, on the grounds that it is
not constructed in accord with the provisions of the Probate Code
(in that the Players named as recipients of Sherlock's largesse are
not in fact creditors of ChrisM).

I would be willing to support a Proposal extending the authority of
Trustees to cover more creative plans such as Sherlock's, as long as 
it included some safeguards to prevent gross abuse; but, for the time 
being, we have different Rules and should abide by them.

I will however make the following exception, in the spirit of what 
is becoming an Agoran tradition - if properly bribed, such as by 
altering the Probate plan to transfer to myself one more Indulgence 
than to any other Player named therein, I will refrain from further 
objections.

Of course, someone is bound to bring up the point that any other
Player can make a similar demand and thus ensure that no Probate plan
of the kind Sherlock proposes will go unopposed, to which I can only
answer that that is reason enough to discourage such plans. ;)

[ This is posted to the business list because I am upholding my plan,
  but elaborating on the reasoning.  This is my way of re-formulating
  the Plan, per 1738.  I do not have to stop posting about this Plan
  until a CFJ is lodged. ]
 
I would ask you to look again at the rules of Probate (1601, 1637,
1738, 1739, 1757).  I do not believe your objections stand up on
examination.
 
First of all, I am arguing that, since there seems to be no definition
of "terminal" defined nor any apparent means for making an entity
"terminal", ChrisM cannot be considered so.  Thus the sections of the 
Probate rules relevant to "terminal" entities do not apply.
 
Now, let us examine the issue of creditors.  Rule 1739 states that the
_first_ action in a Probate plan will pay off the creditors of the
entity.  In this case, ChrisM has, apparantly, none, so we must move
on to the next stipulations.  All of the following text deals with
"terminal" entities, which I am arguing is irrelevant.
 
Thus, since no Probate rule determines what occurs to "non-terminal"
entities, and nowhere does it state that an entity in Probate must
leave eir currencies _solely_ to creditors, the recipients of eir 
Will and the Bank (except in "terminal" sections) I am opting for a
different path.
 
I therefore uphold my plan, to commence a week from this post.
