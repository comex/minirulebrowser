With macross's registration the VTpP is closer to 7 now, but 9 seems a
reasonable starting value to me, as well.  So I hereby set the Voting Token
Circulation Level to 9.

PS.  Welcome back macross!  Hope you'll be able to stick around a while.

I just sent a message that was a criminal act.  I am mortified.  My
intent was to keep it in my unsent message file until the
Conter-Revolution Orders were vacated, I don't know if sending it was
accidental, or if I was overtaken with enthusiasm by finding a loophole
around the Counter-Revolution.

Be that as it may.  I did not intend to commit such a willful violation
of an Order as I was campaigning against myself.  I immediately vacate
the Order in the message "No New Player Tyranny," I transfer a Kudo from
myself to Macross because I acted like an idiot, and I CFJ on the
following;

Statement: "Player Swann committed the crime of Contempt by Action."

Reasons and Arguments:

I believe that Macross' Orders were valid, and when I published the
message entitled "No New Player Tyranny"-- either through accident or
excessive enthusiasm-- I violated Rule 1811 and committed a Class C
Crime.  I plead no contest and will not appeal the Judge's verdict on
the matter. I only hope is that the Agora public will recognize this as
a genuine accident and not a willful and hypocritical flouting of the
principles I've been wont to expouse.

Swann

You cannot deKudo the same Player twice in the same week.  Since you already
deKudo'd yourself yesterday, this attempt fails.  Of course, you can rectify
this on Monday.  8)

I apologize for yet another one of these.  It is an effort to erase 
any ambiguity in what is happening here.  I also apologize for the
more restrictive clauses here, my original intent was only to forbid
*only* the kind of broad, general, and unlimited Orders that allowed me
to seize power. Apparently, it seems that it is in the nature of the
Order Rules that it seems impossible to draft language to specifically
ban those typse of Orders-- at least no language that some players might
find void or ambigious.  Therefore I am banning all but the three most
common Orders, and placing a clause for me to approve any other Orders
on a case-by-case basis.  I find it somewhat distatseful, but I don't
want the scam to flounder on nitpicks about the language of the Orders,
when that is almost wholly beside the point.

So, again, we amend.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is a list of all Orders that I have issued that are in

{Comment: This is what I should have done, instead of that unfortunate
          message "No New Player Tyranny."  This is an explicit
          amendment that I believe is legal under the Order Rules, which 
          state that Orders are directed at entities, not Players.}

Orders in the message "Here we go..." which would be CDO-027 to CDO-053
have all been vacated and are no longer in force.

I hereby transfer one Kudo from Swann, for constantly tweaking his
"Coup d'etat Orders", to Macross, for riding to the rescue.  Frankly,
I'm getting tired of Swann's "oops, I need to amend my orders again"
posts.  Get it right the first time, or go away.

I guess I'm going to have to piss off General Chaos again.  Maybe I can
turn these announcements into a Government Newspaper.

Fortunately for the regime, Macross still has left me leave to amend
my existing Orders with impunity, and I do so.
======================================================================
The following is a list of all Orders that I have issued that are in
effect and in the form which they are effective.  I have retroactively
numbered them for reference.  All differences between and Order on this
list and the prior form of that Order is an amendment of that Order and
shall be the governing form of that Order.

        Swann has given explicit written permission (containing the full 
        text of the Order), in the Public Forum, for em to issue.

{Comment: This is what I should have done, instead of that unfortunate
          message "No New Player Tyranny."  This is an explicit
          amendment that I believe is legal under the Order Rules, which 
          state that Orders are directed at entities, not Players.}

Orders in the message "Here we go..." which would be CDO-027 to CDO-053
have all been vacated and are no longer in force.
