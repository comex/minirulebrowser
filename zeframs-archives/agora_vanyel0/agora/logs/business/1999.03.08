This message contains exactly one Proposal.  The Proposal begins
immediately after the line marked "**START PROPOSAL" and ends at the
end of the message.
  
The following Proposal is to be titled "Simplify Probate" and is to
have Adoption Index 1.
**START PROPOSAL
Be it resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is disempowered if it does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary is permitted and authorized to perform any of the
          following with respect to a disempowered entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the disempowered entity for
            the purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the
            disempowered entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            disempowered entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) A disempowered entity is considered to continue to have
          legal existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency or is named as the payor or payee of a Payment
          Order, even if it would otherwise be dissolved or destroyed,
          or otherwise cease to have legal existence, prior to that
          time.

      (d) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would impair
          the Notary in the exercise of the powers granted in
          subdivision (b) of this Rule.

/verbose on

There are several issues that I feel need to be addressed in this case.

The first concerns the meaning of "legal significance".  Before this CFJ
I had taken a rather simplistic view of this phrase, but now I see that
there can be at least two different categories of "legal significance"
within Agora.  One is the very strict category of items that have
"legal significance" as explicitly defined by the Rules.  Another is the
rather loose category of items that have "legal significance" by virtue
of their relationship to entities defined by the Rules.  The case at hand
provides an excellent example for this distinction, namely, appellations.
The official proposal number is an appellation directly defined by the
Rules and therefore has legal significance of the strict kind.
However, there is nothing that prevents a proposer or Promotor
from associating another appellation with a Proposal which can then
take on legal significance of the looser kind, since this appellation
can be used by Players to cause changes in the game state
(i.e. by using it to cast votes).

If we were to disallow anything to have legal significance other
than the strict kind, Morendil's judgement would be without question
correct.  Only one Proposal had the strictly legal designation of 3830
and by referring to that number in eir post, Vlad, intending it or not,
could only be referring to the original P3830.  However, I think we
have strong game custom, as well as the best interests of the game,
in considering the second, looser form of legal significance to be valid.
When Promotor G.Chaos attempted to reassign 3830 to the new
proposal, e temporarily created an appellation for P3833 that was
identical to the official appellation of P3830.  Of course, at this point
3830 became ambiguous as to which Proposal it actually referred.
This brings us to the second issue - what is the significance of an
ambiguous voting message?

Unfortunately, the Rules are less clear here than I would like.  R683 does
not explicitly say that a Player's vote must unambiguously refer to a
particular Proposal.  It merely says that a Player votes on a Proposal
when e informs the Assessor that e is voting on "that Proposal".  I see
three possible interpretations when the reference to a Proposal is ambiguous:

1.  The voting message actually cast a vote on *both* Proposals.
2.  The voting message is invalid, since it does not specify explicitly
     what "that Proposal" is.
3.  The Assessor resolves the ambiguity, or invalidates the message
     at eir own discretion.

The more I think about it, the more I am inclined to believe that the strict
letter of the law would require interpretation 1.  However, I also think that
this is a case where it is unambigously clear that Vlad's intention was
to cast a single vote on a single Proposal, and so I am inclined to take
this into account and discard option 1.  That is to say, Vlad clearly
only cast one vote and the Rules do not allow a single vote to be
split between more than one Proposal.

Although I think 2 may be a reasonable interpretation (and indeed has
been argued as such by others), I am not yet convinced that it carries
more weight than interpretation 3.  And, since it gives me the chance
to set some legal precedent (or maybe at least spark some interesting
debate), I will focus my decision on this interpretation.

Clearly, Assessor Blob operated under interpretation 3 in
determining that the ambiguity should be resolved  by strictly
adhering to the letter of the law regarding Proposal numbers.
(This, of course, assumes you accept the argument that
there *was* ambiguity in the message.  At the time of eir
actions, I suspect Blob did not think so, but that is irrelevant).
Assuming that Blob was within eir right to do this, what then
is the role of the Courts in this case?

One might say that since the Rules did not prevent Blob
from exercising eir own judgement in resolving an ambiguity,
we should just let it stand and live with it.  But I think Players
should have a reasonable recourse against such determinations
that work to their detriment.  So, I will take this opportunity
to either establish new or add to existing precedent that the
role of the Courts is to review such actions and to uphold
or rectify them (as much as possible).  It is my opinion that the
Courts should not overturn such actions unless there is compelling
reason to do so.  In this case, I think there are such compelling
reasons because, IMO, it is in the best interests of the game that:

    a) Players should be able to operate under the reasonable assumption
        that official reports and announcements are correct.  In other words,
        although it is their right to double-check and question the validity
        of official messages, it should not be a *requirement* to do so.
    b) As much as possible, errors made by one Player should not
        irreversibly negatively impact other Players.

To accept Blob's actions as Assessor in this case would run counter
to both of the above principles.  Since the outcome of this analysis
leads to the same conclusion has accepting interpretation 2, I will
leave arguments in it's favor in the hands of the other Justices.

/verbose off

Therefore, I hereby vote to overturn Morendil's judgement and return
a judgement of TRUE.
