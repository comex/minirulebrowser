This Week with R-O-M

There are 339 Rules in the current Rule set by my count.  My random number
generator spit out the following numbers:

215 = Rule  651 Heroes
 15 = Rule 1023 Definition of "As Soon As Possible"
257 = Rule 1785 Accountor
120 = Rule 1583 Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players
 10 = Rule 1586 Definition and Continuity of Entities

I choose Rule 1586.  Let's see if we can get rid of the concept of Nomic
Entity.  I will add provisions to the proposal to rid the entire Rule set of
references to "Nomic Entities".

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1586 (Definition and Continuity of Entities)
          This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1586 is hereby Repealed.

Amend Rule 1513 by replacing all occurences of the string "Nomic Entities" with
"entities" and by replacing all occurences of the string "Nomic Entity" with
"entity".

Amend Rule 1369 by replacing the string "a Nomic Entity" with "an entity".

Amend Rule 1478 by replacing the string "A Nomic Entity" with "An entity".

Amend Rule 1470 by replacing the string "a Nomic Entity" with "an entity".

Amend Rule 1614 by replacing the string "Nomic Entity" with "entity defined by
the Rules".

Claim admitted.  VT2124 is hereby amended by replacing the Payee "Threat" with
the Payee "Time Agent".

I don't think you can ignore this PO, since the PI Infraction Rule makes no
distinction between Payees that are registered Players or not.  Better satisfy
it and then let the Probate process take care of it later.

Actually, I see that it is not a question of amending the order.  I didn't
issue it, I just misreported it.  The above remark should just be construed as
an "amendment" to the report - VT2124 was correctly issued as a PO from the
Bank to Time Agent.
