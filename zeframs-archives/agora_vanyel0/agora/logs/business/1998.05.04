This Week with R-O-M

By my count there are now 343 Rules in the current Rule set.  Here are the
latest 5 random numbers:

 40 = Rule 1686 Official Reports
278 = Rule 1790 Buying Points
 55 = Rule 1665 Abuse of Responsibility
292 = Rule 1648 When the Speaker is Tainted
255 = Rule 1735 The Chancellor as Bank's Executor

Hmm.  I select Rule 1648.  You can still get a Tainted Speaker by Referendum,
so I don't think I'll make any other changes with this one.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I hereby submit the
following proposal:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 1648 (When the Speaker is Tainted)
This Proposal shall have an AI = 1
Rule 1648 is hereby Repealed.
