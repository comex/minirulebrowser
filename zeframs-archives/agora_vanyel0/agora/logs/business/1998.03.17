I have not forgotten my promise to pay off people not voting against 3710,
should it pass.  It appears that 3710's passage will take some time to
resolve in the Courts, but I do not wish to appear backward.  Therefore I
request that if Payment Order (VT1950) somehow becomes vacated, that the
recipients will repay these transfers.

I hereby make the following transfers from myself:

   to Chuck,      2.5 VTs;
   to Jester,     2.5 VTs;
   to Murphy,     2.5 VTs; and
   to Time Agent, 2.5 VTS.

Regards,
-- elJefe
