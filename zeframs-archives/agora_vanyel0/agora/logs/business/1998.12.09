I hereby cast two votes against P3815. I was about to support this and
give up all the white, grey and other elephants that P3815 proposes to
kill, when Blob joined the Order - so, to preserve groups (and Power
of Attorney) I vote against P3815. 

Nudge to Morendil: why not split up the repeals into smaller batches,
trying to find majorities at least for some of them? 

Crito and Scott - I'm still undecided on the currencies issue. Care to
do any campaigning?
