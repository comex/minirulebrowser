You are not.  I misrecorded Morendil's FA vote on 3640.  In fact the
reported results on 3640 through 3649 are in error due to a typo in
the Assessor's journal, and will need to be rereported.  I don't know
yet if the outcome of any Proposal is affected.

I still await reports, as mandated by Rule 1738, from the
Recordkeepors for Indulgences, Proposal Notes, Irises, and
Frankenstein Monsters.  

I further note that no Trustee is authorized to formulate or implement
a Plan until all of the reports required of Currency Recordkeepors by
Rule 1738 have been received, and that on that basis all Plans
formulated to date are improper.
