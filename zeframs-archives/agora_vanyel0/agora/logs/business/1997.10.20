H. Promotor Crito!

I hereby submit the following Proposal, Disinterestedly.

####
Proposal
Prohibit Retroactivity

[Comment: Rule 108 has turned out to be a lot weaker than we
thought. This proposal will give it back some teeth. Thanks go
to Chuck for the wording.]

Promotor, please note: this Proposal has an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 108 be amended to read:

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 108 are Peter Suber,
Steve and Chuck.

H. Promotor Crito!

I hereby submit the following Proposal, Disinterestedly.

####
Proposal
Majority Appeal decisions

[Comment: in a couple of CFJs recently, we have seen a majority of
the Justices agree to overturn a decision - only to have the CFJ
then reassigned because of the way R1693 is worded. I propose to
fix this problem. In general, I have tried to make clearer the
relationship between the rulings of individual Justices and the
Board's ruling.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1693 be amended to read:

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices 
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

H. Promotor, please note the follwing proposals I'd like to submit:

I. Judicial Cleanup

---
1. Amend 1563 by replacing the second paragraph with

If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other rules it
lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

2. Cosmetic changes: 

Amend 1565 by

replacing the string "when only when" in the third paragraph by "only
when".

And in the last paragraph relacing "a Judicial Salary of 3 Mil" by "a
Judicial Salary of 1 VT".
---

[Note that the last change will simply be ineffective if Scott's
proposal is accepted.]


II. Fix Internomic referenda

---
Amend 1632 by adding the following sentence to the third paragraph
(Duration of Voting):

If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than three days, the
Voting Period shall instead last for three days or until two days
before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant InterNomic
Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.
---

[Note that, if this still does not lead to a voting period of a
positive length, the Ambassador has clearly failed to distribute the
proposal ASAP, according to 1632.]

Yes, that would achieve the desired effect.  We're going to do something
about these `Pragmatic' Currencies though.

H. Promotor!  A Proposal, to have AI=3.1:

###

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created with Power 3.1, reading

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no such thing as a
      Currency, a Paymont Order, a Transfer Order, or a unit of Currency,
      exists.

###

(I'm rather pissed off right now, both with these bloody Currencies and
the complete lack of aesthetic judgement being demonstrated.)
