H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to the Bank
to increase its Priority to 1.

####
Proposal
Speaker Transition Reform

Be it hereby resolved that R402 (Speaker Transition) be amended to read:

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

[Comment: (i) ensures justice; during a Transition, one remains Speaker
in name only. (ii) ensures certainty about identity of the Speaker;
the Speaker only changes when the Registrar says so, so there's no
chance of a change of Speaker going unnoticed. (iii) ensures certainty
about the identity of the Speaker in a different way: if the holder
of the Office of Speaker-Elect changes after the commencment of the
Transition but before the Registrar's Notice, the succession is not
affected.]

Be it further resolved that R1648 (When the Speaker is Tainted) be
amended to read:

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

[Comment: post-Revolt Speakers are not necessarily Tainted.]

Be it further resolved that R1664 (Rebellion) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

      - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker

with text which reads:

      - a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R681 (Giving up the Speakership) be amended
to read:

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the
      new Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

[Comment: makes R681 PC-compliant, and closes a loophole I once
exploited to achieve consecutive 3 month terms as Speaker.]

Be it further resolved that R1375 (Speaker Going On Hold) be amended to
read:

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the
      Crime of Speaker Inactivity, a Class B Crime.

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

Be it further resolved that R942 be repealed.

[Comment: a hopeless mess.]

Be it further resolved that that R1581 (Quarterly Speaker Change) be
amended to read:

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.
