I'm going to have to Object to all of these Ratifications, simply
because I don't have the time to check all of them, and no reason to
believe that they are all 100% correct, even though it's probably the
case that most of them are.

Chuck, have you had a chance to research Rule 1643's Amendment Number?
Is the AN correct, or is there a missing annotation?
