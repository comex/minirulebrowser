Decision of the Justiciar:  FALSE (overturning the original Judgement)

General Chaos is being too picky here, but the question is, should the COE
have been admitted?  Morendil's claim essentially says that Harlequin's
Transfer Orders of 20 September did satisfy the indicated Payment Orders,
when the General said they did not.

According to Rule 1732, a PO can only be satisfied when the appropriate TO
is successfully executed and the amount named is correct.  According to
Rule 1598, this could only happen if Harlequin had enough VTs.  As CFJ 933
has established, on 20 September nobody had any VTs.  Thus the TOs could
not have satisfied the POs, as claimed (though for reasons other than the
ones given).

In my reading of Rule 1431, the essence of the response to a COE is the
denial or acceptance (and in the latter case, posting of the corrected
portion of the report).  Rule 1431 does _not_ require the respondent to
post reasons and arguments.

Therefore, denying a claim for the wrong reason does not constitute
Wrongful COE Denial, if the claim should have been denied for other
reasons.  This is mostly a good thing; for an Officer it should be enough
to get the decision right, without having to make sure the reasons are
perfect too.

Thus I vote to overturn the judgement, and rule that the CFJ should be
judged FALSE.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Justiciar

I call for the Appeal of this Dismissal, as it was not done for a legal
reason.

I also Transfer a Kudo from Chuck for ignoring the Rules for Dismissal, to
Morendil, who really doesn't deserve the deep trouble he's got himself
into.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I claim that this is in Error, as only 4 Injunctions were actually 
submitted.

The Recordkeepor for VTs elects to reject these transfers because they

(Herald Crito has been very generous in allowing Delayed Transfer

The above-listed Payment Orders are improvidently executed; the Nomic
Week in which these Judgements were handed down has not yet ended, and
thus it is premature to issue a Payment Order for these particular
Judicial Salaries.  Ref: Rule 502/4.  This is a Claim of Error,
executed as as required by Rule 1735.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following statement :

---
Some or all of the Payment Orders issued by CotC Andre in a message
posted on or about Oct. 11, titled "OFF: Salaries & Infractions",
were illegally issued, as the number of Infractions allegedly
committed by Judge Morendil in issuing Injunctions in eir Judgement
of CFJ 1045 did not exceed 4, the number of Injunctions therein
issued.
---

Reasoning :

Rule 663 permits an Injunction to apply more than one Player.
Therefore it is consistent to read the message in the relevant
Judgement as issuing 4 Injunctions. That the statement of the
Injunctions themselves refers to 'Injunctions' rather than 'an
Injunction' may be considered irrelevant under 754; further, Rule
663 requires that *each* Injunction should specify the Player or
Players to which it applies; thus, this reading is rendered necessary 
as well as legal by Rule 663; for multiple Injunctions to exist, 
mutliple specifications should exist, whereas "all current Officers" 
is merely one specification.

I bar Andre, Steve and elJefe. (The reason for doing so is that as
Justices in the relevant Board of Appeals, each Player named seems
to have already formed a conclusion as to this issue, which
conclusion was not part of what that Board was to consider - it seems
prudent, therefore, to leave a final decision in the hands of Players
who cannot be considered biased.)

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.
========================================

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

In the matter of CFJ 930:

The Appelate Court has already rendered a majority opinion on this
issue, and it would be foolhardy of me to stand opposed to that
opinion.

Therefore:  A Judgement of FALSE is hereby entered.  

It is so ordered.
