All right, I'll have to admit I made a mistake here.  I misread that
proposal to mean something completely different than it does.

I change my vote for INP 361 to FOR.

[ All right, I've thought this through, and I'm going to take a risk.]

  I hereby declare a Paradox.  

  Our recently passed Rule, concerning the destruction of
  Voting Tokens, contains a contradiction.  It destroys all
  Voting Tokens, but then requires the payment of five to
  each Player.  Since this action obviously cannot occur,
  we are stuck.  By Rule 101, we must enact this rule and
  obey it, yet we are unable to.

  Thus Agora Nomic cannot currently continue with its current
  Ruleset.

I hereby submit the following CFJ, barring Time Agent and Chuck:

"If a Player makes two Votes FOR a Proposal, and subsequently cancels those
votes, and no other Player in any way Votes on the Proposal, the Voting
Index of that Proposal at the end of its Voting Period is two."

Arguments:

Rule 1442, in describing the method of cancelling votes, only states that
such a cancellation "cancels" the Votes. However, they were at one time
legally cast. Rule 955, in defining Voting Indices, only counts Votes that
were "legally cast;" it does not say "Votes which have been legally cast
and not cancelled at the end of the Voting Period." Therefore, any votes
which were legally cast, no matter what their later status, shall count
towards the Proposal's Voting Index.

I hereby appeal this CFJ. I believe that, since I am named in the
statement, my assertion is sufficient to cause it's appeal.

This is false.  The single insistence clause applies to the appeal of
an Injunction naming the appellant, and to the appeal of a judgement
alleging that the appellant committed a Crime or Infraction.  Neither
is the case here.

However, I join the call for the Appeal of the CFJ in question.
