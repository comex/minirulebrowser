INTERNOMIC
----------

2/12  Agora will vote for INP 360.

2/15  .Nomic becomes a non-voting member of InterNomic.

2/16  Agora votes against INPs 361 and 362.

2/17  INP 363 (submitted by Agora) would create a rule requiring the
        moderator to be subscribed to the InterNomic mailing list, and
        stating that sending a message to the mailing list satisfies
        any requirement to send that message to the moderator.

      .Nomic is reported to be suffering from infinite wins, due to
        typos in some recent proposals.

      OxNomic is reported to have created a Puppet named Death that
        does more or less the same thing as the Repeal-O-Matic.

2/18  Thring is revealed to have a rule (created by Proposal 1073)
        requiring it to vote against all INPs, appeal or support the
        appeal of all SFJs, and otherwise make InterNomic processes
        take longer.

2/11  Blob and Morendil cease to be Boors.


ERRATA
------
