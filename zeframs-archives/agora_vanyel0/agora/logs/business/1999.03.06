Having received the required support, and four days having passed, I
declare that the prevaling mode of voting on Proposals is henceforth
Unrestricted. This means that votes can be sent either publically or
privately.

Note however that this does not apply to proposals currently up for vote, 
but only to proposals distributed from now on.

I hereby advance the Priority of the Proposal 'Adjusting New Player
Awards' (#127) by one, using my Promotor's Privilege to do so.

There's a paucity of decent Proposals in the Queue right now (other
than my own, which I cannot use my Privilege on); therefore, the
exercise of my Promotor's Privilege for next week is open for
negotiation.
