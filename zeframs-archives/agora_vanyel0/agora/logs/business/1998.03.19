Judgement : FALSE.

R&A : I'm still not satisfied with my own reasoning on this, nor with 
the arguments that have been offered, pro or con. I therefore return 
a decision of FALSE, on the grounds that Rule 1660 does succeed in 
granting additional Votes, despite being afflicted with essentially 
the same wording as 1766; however, I also call for the Appeal of my 
own Judgement, thereby kicking it up to the higher Court. I will 
present a fuller version of my analysis of 206, 1766 and 1660 in that 
capacity, hopefully made more cogent by conferring with my fellow 
Justices.

I'm sorry about this...  I somehow got the idea that Morendil's message to
me had been sent to the Public Forum.  Otherwise I would have pointed out
that I was not CotC at the time.

H. Accountor:
  I hereby transfer 0.5 VT to Morendil, in partial compensation.

Regards,

Dear Steve, 

sorry to cause more work, but I have two corrections to this report.

Firstly, I think P3698 passed "Passed By the Narrowest of Margins"
according to 1786, so you'll have to pay out 3 VTs to me.

Secondly, I voted on P3702, but you seem to have missed this. Not that
it makes a difference, but still...

Kolja A.

I believe this Proposal Passed by the Narrowest of Margins.  (I have

While I'm here, I'm transferring 3 VTs to the Bank to satisfy
Assessor's Order aaa113.
