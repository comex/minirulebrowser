H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes to the Bank
to increase its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Tweak R833

[Comment: the current version of R833 makes the timing of the POs
awkward for the Assessor, who may have to refer back to previous
Reports to determine which Proposals were adopted in the previous
week.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 have its Title changed to
"Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed" and that it be amended
to read:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for adopted Proposals distributed at the same time.

H. Promotor Crito,

I hereby submit the following Proposal, paying 2 P-Notes the Bank to increase
its Priority to 2.

####
Proposal
Encourage VT spending

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 3.

[Comment: the current Proposal/voting system allows VT expenditure
to drop to almost nothing as a response to VT scarcity: it only takes
1 VT to pass a Proposal, provided enough Players declare Presence.
I propose to block that avenue of escape from scarcity by raising
the minimum expenditure required to pass a Proposal to 3 VTs. I also
clarify the status of uncancelled votes with respect to R955.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a
Proposal) be amended to read:

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1088

  "When a Proposal is declared to be a Senate Proposal, and Votes
   were previously cast on such a Proposal by Entities who were not
   Senators, such Votes are nevertheless still legal Votes and should be
   taken into account for the purpose of determining Voting results."


======================================================================

Judge:      Michael
Judgement:  TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

The Caller's arguments seem sound.  The situation which held at the
time of the calling of this CFJ was this: 

* proposals pass/are adopted if they receive sufficient (legal) votes
  (R955, power = 3)

* a vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of
  a Proposal and if the Voting Entity casting the vote is entitled to
  cast a vote on that particular Proposal (R683, power = 1).

* "Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
   If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
   Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
   on that Proposal are cancelled."  (R1717, power = 1)

Our initial question is to ask what it means for a vote to be
cancelled.  A natural interpretation of this provision is to assume it
means that a vote is deprived of its legal effect.  This view seems
consistent with R1442, which discusses what happens when a Voting
Entity to voluntarily cancel its votes.

However, neither R1717 nor R1442 claims precedence over R683.  Nor
does R683 yield precedence.  Therefore, it must be the case that if
R683 says a vote is legally cast, then it is cast and must be counted,
R1717 and R1442 notwithstanding. 

There is still one more condition to investigate.  R683 requires that
a Voting Entity be entitled to cast a vote if that vote is to be
legal.  An argument against the statement of the CFJ might claim that
when a Proposal is made a Senate Proposal this action will
retroactively deprive Voting Entities of their entitlement to cast
legal votes.

I reject this argument on the grounds that this view is too much of a
stretch to impose on the language of R683.  Here is the relevant
sentence as it appears in the rule : 

  "A Vote is legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of
   that Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
   on that particular Proposal."

It is far too much to ask this rule to mean "... if that Voting Entity
is entitled to cast a Vote and remains entitled to having been able to
cast that Vote on that particular Proposal for the rest of its Voting
Period."  While such an interpretation has some appeal (it would deny
legality to votes cast by Players who deregister while a Proposal's
Voting Period is in progress, and would simplify the Senate rule), it
is *not* what is currently written, and is too far in sense from what
is written to be a possible interpretation of Rule 683.

Therefore I return a judgement of TRUE.

Michael.

                               CFJ 1090

   No Proposal entitled "The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal" has
   been distributed.

=====================================================================

Judge:       Michael
Judgement:   TRUE

The definition of Proposal is in Rule 1483, power = 1.  

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

The issue of contention in the statement of the CFJ comes about
because a piece of text presumed to have been a Proposal was
distributed by Promotor Blob at time Wed, 4 Mar 1998 13:14:12 +1100
(EST), in an e-mail message with ID:
   <980304021412.8886@cse.unsw.edu.au>.

However, the text distributed as Proposal 3710 included the following:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal numberat time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a
      loophole in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

I shall now argue that this paragraph was not present in any
collection of text delivered to the Promotor with the clear indication
that this text was intended to become a Proposal.

Who might have delivered such a text?  Swann certainly did not deliver
this text to Blob.  He did deliver a similar text, but it was
sufficiently different not to be legally the same.  (The only rules
allowing for different texts to be considered legally same are R754,
which talks only of differences of spelling, grammar and dialect, and
R1339 which talks of variation of white-space and capitalisation in
rule change specifications.)  

Could Blob have delivered the text to himself in such a way as to
satisfy the conditions in R1483?  This is a more interesting question.
However, I do not believe that this could have happened for two
reasons: 

i)  We have no evidence to suggest that Blob at any stage initiated
    the delivery of the text in question, except possibly when he
    distributed the text in the message referred to above.  We rule
    out this latter possibility, because as is clear from the
    reactions of the Players of Agora (who voted on the putative
    Proposal), there was no clear indication that this text was
    intended to become a Proposal.  Rather the distribution of this
    text (including its delivery to Blob via the Public Forum)
    convinced everyone that a real Proposal was before them and had
    been distributed.  

ii) Even if Blob did manage to somehow deliver the text to himself
    prior to his ditribution of it to the Public Forum, his subsequent
    behaviour again suggests that there was no clear indication
    attached to the text that this was intended to become a Proposal.
    If there had been such an indication with the text, then he would
    not have distributed it under Swann's name, and would not have
    attributed it an Urgency that it did not have.

As the text distributed in the message referred to above is the only
possible instance of a Proposal being distributed with the name in
question, and as I have ruled out this possibility, I conclude that
the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.

Michael.

Hi all, 

I'd like to suggest a fix for the scoring problem with vacated
blots. At the same time, I wonder whether it wouldn't be more
efficient if the players issuing or vacating blots would order the
associated score change, instead of the Herald?

Proto: 

amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The player issuing (or vacating) the corresponding PO
      must order this Score change.

Proto-Proposal
Tabula Rasa

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, and with 12 Players
having just won the game courtesy of Chuck's counterscam, *definitely*
too many VTs. Time to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all unsatisfied
      Payment Orders naming the Bank as Payor issued under the authority
      of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are vacated.
      Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any Player as
      Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]

I agree with Steve's interpretation that the provisions listed
in CVS2 take effect with the authority of a Power=1 instrument.
Not that CVS2 has Power=1--its Power is still 0--but the Rule
created by CVS1 has Power=1, and it states that the provisions
of CVS2 take effect.

However, even with this, none of the provisions in CVS2 have
any effect:

>The Rule entitled "A Monument to the Threat" is hereby repealed.

No such Rule.

>If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then a Rule, entitled "A Win for
>Non-Threat" is hereby created, with the following text:

P3710 has not been adopted, so the Rule is not created.

>Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

Rule 955 has Power=3, so is not amended.

>If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then the Rule whose text
>begins, "No instrument can create, or empower another entity to create,"
>has its Power set to 3, and is amended to read as follows; if
>Proposal 3710 has not been adopted, then a Rule is created with Power=3
>and text as follows:

P3710 has not been adopted, and a Power=1 instrument cannot create
a Rule with Power=3.

Of course, should CFJ 1090 be overturned, then the above does not
apply.  (If P3710 did pass, then the Power of CVS2 is 5.)
