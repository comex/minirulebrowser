Please read this carefully, it pertains to a number of Players.


Blob and Sherlock having resigned, the Probate list now looks like this:

Entity         Trustee     VTs  P-Notes  Indulgences  Other
-----------------------------------------------------------
Andre          Morendil     0      7          1       1 Blot
ChrisM         <none>       0      0          6
Elde           <none>       0      0          1
Vir            Time Agent   0      0         31
Zefram         Murphy       0      2          6       3 P-Notes owed to Bank

I hereby appoint myself as Trustee of ChrisM's estate, and as Trustee of
Elde's estate.

Jester, I believe that no entity in Probate possesses any Jester's Ode
Favores; would you please confirm this belief?

I have verified the above VT, P-Note, Indulgence, and Iris data against the
latest Reports from the Accountor, Promotor, Herald, and Vizier of the Order
of the Evil Eye.  However, due to how the Rules are written, I need those
folks to confirm the data yet again for ChrisM and Elde.

I hereby formulate the following plan for Zefram:
* Transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank to satisfy POP017
* Transfer 1 P-Note to the Bank to satisfy POP036
* Vacate POP042
* Transfer 6 Indulgences to the Bank

I suggest the following plan for Andre:
* Transfer 1 Indulgence to the Bank to satisfy POI697
* Transfer 7 P-Notes to the Bank

I suggest the following plan for Vir:
* Transfer 31 Indulgences to the Bank

Changes from v3.6:

* 25 VTs reduced to 5 VTs.  However, each Player's first three Plots
    purchased from the Bank are free.
* Precedence clause added to Rule defining effect of Church ownership.



Proto-Proposal:  Plots (v3.7)


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes precedence over any
      Rule attempting to prevent Churches from having this effect.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

3/11  Speaker Steve makes this announcement:

      "If two more of the 4 currently Rebellious Players (Harlequin,
       Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent) will agree to become Abiding,
       so pushing the prospect of another Revolt further into the
       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections
       to free up some of the Offices held by the Threat, namely,
       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."

      Sherlock becomes Abiding.

      Chuck becomes Rebellious.

3/22  Sherlock becomes Rebellious.

3/24  Blob becomes Rebellious.
