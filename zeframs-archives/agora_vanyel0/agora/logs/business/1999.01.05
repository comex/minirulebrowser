have settled down a bit, and I can give some more time to Agora.
I'll volunteer to take on all the currency recordkeeping again, if no
one else will.  So, I hereby nominate for Accountor, Herald, and
Promotor.  I will, however, stand down on two of these Offices if
anyone else wants to nominate for any of them.

H. Assessor,

I vote FOR 3822 and announce presence (for now) on 3821.

Blob, now that the CotC has the ability to select as e sees fit,
why should we vote for 3821?  This seems to take back some
of the power in that amendment (except that e gets to choose
the order).

   3822 Crito          1 Honour without Dishonour
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3821 (Blob) AI = 1
Let everyone have a turn

Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:

      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments: 

v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection 
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be 
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.
]
======================================================================
Proposal 3822 (Crito) AI = 1
Honour without Dishonour

Let the following Rule be created with Power = 1;

Herald's Privilege

      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the increase.
      At the same time as e makes this announcement, the Herald shall
      record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of said Player.

[A nice perk for the Herald, and a way to recognize honorable acts
of Players without requiring a 'victim'.  I deliberately left the
allowable justifications to the discretion of the Herald.]

Protoproposal: Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for
      collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
      On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
      Bid.

      Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one particular
      currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction Currency is
      the Voting Token.

      Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that an Auction is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the
      Auction Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
      value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
      is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
      during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
      Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
      particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
      valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the
              Auction, or after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
          (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made
              so far in the Auction.

      End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
      there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
      winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
      without a valid Bid having been made.

      The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
      largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The
      Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
      as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
      a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
      equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

Protoproposal: All You Zombies...

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration due to Silence) to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to become a Zombie by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E then becomes
      a Zombie. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      a Zombie. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the Player has become a Zombie.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Change the title of Rule 1042 to "Zombification due to Silence".

Create a rule, with titled "Zombie Masters", with text:

      All Players who are Zombies have a Master, who owns them.
      When a Player first becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the
      Bank. Zombies may only be transferred from one Master to
      another as explicitly described by the rules.

      If a Player becomes a Zombie's Master, then e is granted
      Power of Attorney for the Zombie, for as long as e remains
      the Zombie's Master. Non-player Zombie Masters are not
      granted Power of Attorney in this way.

      If a Player who owns a Zombie deregisters, all eir Zombies
      become owned by the Bank. The Registrar is required to
      announce this transfer as soon as possible after the
      Player's deregistration, and the transfer takes effect at
      the time it is announced.

      The Registrar is required to keep track of which Players
      are Zombies, and who their Masters are, and publish this
      information in eir Report.

Create a rule, with title "Zombie Auctions", and text:

      Each week, if there are any Zombies owned by the Bank, for
      which Auctions are not already underway, the Registrar
      shall conduct an Auction for each of those Zombies. The
      Auctioneer for these Auctions shall be the Registrar. The
      Auction Currency is Indulgences, and the Starting Price
      for each Auction is equal to the number of Blots held by
      the Zombie being Auctioned.

      When the Winner of the Auction is announced, e becomes
      the Zombie's new Master.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the
      Registrar shall vacate any Blots that owned by the
      Zombie.

Create a rule, with title "Returning to Life", and text:

      If a Zombie Player becomes Noisy, then e is no longer
      a Zombie, and eir Master ceases to own em.

      As soon as possible afterwards, the Registrar shall pay
      out a number of Indulgences equal the starting price in
      that Zombie's most recent Auction, halved for each new
      calendar month since the end of the Auction.

Protoproposal: All You Zombies... v1.1

Amend Rule 1042 (Deregistration due to Silence) to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Change the title of Rule 1042 to "Zombification due to Silence".
 
Create a rule, with titled "Zombie Masters", with text:

      All Players who are Zombies have a Master, who owns them. 
      When a Player first becomes a Zombie, eir Master is the 
      Bank. Zombies may only be transferred from one Master to
      another as explicitly described by the rules.

      If a Player becomes a Zombie's Master, then e is granted
      Power of Attorney for the Zombie, for as long as e remains
      the Zombie's Master. Non-player Zombie Masters are not
      granted Power of Attorney in this way.

      If a Player who owns a Zombie deregisters, all eir Zombies
      become owned by the Bank. The Registrar is required to
      announce this transfer as soon as possible after the
      Player's deregistration, and the transfer takes effect at
      the time it is announced.

      The Registrar is required to keep track of which Players
      are Zombies, and who their Masters are, and publish this
      information in eir Report.

Create a rule, with title "Zombie Auctions", and text:

      Each week, if there are any Zombies owned by the Bank, for
      which Auctions are not already underway, the Registrar 
      shall conduct an Auction for each of those Zombies. The
      Auctioneer for these Auctions shall be the Registrar. The
      Auction Currency is Indulgences, and the Starting Price 
      for each Auction is equal to the number of Blots held by 
      the Zombie being Auctioned.

      When the Winner of the Auction is announced, e becomes 
      the Zombie's new Master. If the Auction ends without a
      winner, then the Zombie is deregistered.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the 
      Registrar shall vacate any Blots that owned by the 
      Zombie.

Create a rule, with title "Returning to Life", and text:

      If a Zombie Player becomes Noisy, then e is no longer
      a Zombie, and eir Master ceases to own em. 

      Unless the Zombie was owned by the Bank, the Registrar
      shall pay the Zombie's most recent Master a number of
      indulgences equal to the starting price in that Zombie's
      most recent Auction, halved for each new calendar month
      since the end of the Auction. This payment shall be 
      made as soon as possible after the Zombie becomes Noisy.

Amend Rule 1755 (No Non-Player Responsiblilities) to read:

      When a player becomes deregistered or a Zombie, e ceases to be
      a candidate, officer, judge, or executor in probate, or in 
      general to occupy any role or position to which a Rule assigns
      any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered, or who is
      a Zombie, may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes
      precedence over rules which would prevent em from ceasing to
      occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player or Zombie, nor shall it act to prevent a
      non-Player or Zombie from registering, calling CFJs, or doing
      things that non-Players and Zombies are generally able to do.

Amend Rule 1555 (Electees and Removal From Offices) by replacing the
text:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered,
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

with:

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, is deregistered, or
      becomes a Zombie, e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

[Comments:

1.0 - Old Nomickers don't die...

      Silent players are no longer deregistered, but become Zombies.
      Zombies are initially owned by the bank, but are Auctioned off
      for Indulgences (which effectively go towards paying off that
      Zombie's Blots).
 
      The player who so buys a Zombie, gains its Power of Attorney.
      If the Zombie player returns to the game, its Master is 
      refunded some of eir price.

      ...the just get amended.

1.1 - If a Zombie is not bought, it is deregistered, to prevent lots
      of unwanted Zombies from being Auctioned every week.

      Fixed a bug in the refund rule (forgot to say who was being paid).

      Zombies cannot become Officers, Judges, etc.
