Well, there's about 8 hours left in the Voting Period for P3686
(The Return of Points), and by my reckoning, the vote is 7 FOR,
8 AGAINST. Mind you, the 8 votes AGAINST have come from just two
Players, Chuck and General Chaos.

So what to do? Retract my vote and save a precious VT, almost
ensuring the Proposal will fail? Or cast one more vote to tie
the totals up, at least giving another supporter the chance 
possibly to tip the scales over the other way some time in the
next 8 hours? I'm going to flip a coin. Heads, I retract, tails
I vote 2F.

<You just gotta love VT scarcity and public voting, donchya?>

Drum roll, please...tails it is.

H. Assessor General Chaos, 

I hereby cast a second vote FOR P3686.
I hereby retract my vote on P3687.

I should note that as Assessor I number all Payment Orders I issue
with a unique Assessor's Number, and I would hope that all
Recordkeepors will consider the use of such numbers as adequate
identification of the Order in question.  I would encourage other
Officers, or at least those whose duties call for the frequent
issuance of Payment Orders, to establish some similar method of
uniquely identifying the Orders they issue in the course of their
duties.

H. Promotor Crito,

Allow me to be the first to use the Proposal Queue. I hereby submit
the following Silly Proposal, paying 1 P-Note to increase the
Priority of this Proposal to 1.


####
Proposal
A Foolish Holiday

The Silly Person humbly pleads,
Create a Rule forthwith which reads:

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!
####

What is more, I designate you, Honourable Crito, to be next week's
Silly Person.

I need a break.  An evening off from the toils of High Office.

I hereby delegate the Offices of Justiciar, Chancellor, and Assessor
to elJefe, for a period of time which shall end at 1200 GMT on 13
February 1998 (approximately 12 hours from now).

Ah, much better.

I hereby saunter over to the Beer Hall in order to enjoy myself during
my little vacation.  

Oh, what the hell.  I hereby Rebel.  Where's the damn masseuse?

Wake me up when it's all over.

   What the heck...I'll steal the last person's thunder.

   I move to the Beer Hall and become rebellious, which should make
the total six people needed for rebellion.
