Protoproposal Chaos43 [rev. 8]

Unlimited Voting

Be it resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."

No. I said if the inequities are substantial _and_ persistant, then 
there is a problem. I am worried that that might be the case. Certainly
I think we have substantial inequities. That doesn't worry me so much.
It's the fear that they might also be persistant that worries me, and
I think, Steve.

I was just doing some calculations try and do a bit of economic forcasting
and I noticed something rather bad. At the beginning of next month,
at the current BOS, 79 VTs will be injected into circulation. That's an
average of 5.3 per player. That's more than the VTCL, so taxes will be
levied, even if we spend everything we've currently got.

Now I'm not so worried about the number of VTs - after all we have a
month in which to spend them - but I think we should increase the VTCL
to about 8 VTs, so as to avoid excessive taxes.

This is a property of monthly salaries that we failed to foresee.
The total number of VTs in circulation will fluctuate much more widely
now that salaries are paid monthly. At the beginning of the month there
will be far more VTs in circulation than at the end of the month.

Some might say that this is a good reason to go back to weekly salaries,
but I think the opposite. This is an interesting phenomenon, and worth
watching for a while to see how it affects the game. It might create
certain strategic advantages to making proposals at different times of
the month. It will, at least, force players to budget their VT spending
wisely, and not blow all their VTs in the first half of the month.

Of course, with the VTCL currently as low as it is, you have to blow
all your VTs almost immediately, or you lose them through taxation.

Our tax policy is idiotic.  I'll work up a replacement sometime soon.

Wow; a discretionary power for the Registrar! :-)

Given the scope to represent the wishes of the unemployed plebeians, I
think the Registrar's alternative title should be Tribune.

Well there you go! We already have a Rule that does what I want. Why

This falls under two exceptions at once: First, names were often translated
upto about the sixteenth century. When someone has lived in several countries,
often different names for these people are known.

>From my own experience as a autodidact on voyages of discovery, I can for
example give you:
Giovanni Caboto (Italian) - John Cabot (English)
Cristobal Colon (Spanish) - Christophorus Columbus (Latin) (in English
 often de-latinized to Christopher Columbus)
Ferdinand van Olmen (Flemish) - Fernao Dulmo (Portugues)
Fernao de Magelhaes (Portuguese) - Fernao de Magallanes (Spanish) - Ferdinand
 Magellan (English)

Sometimes this can be quite confusing. I lately read a book about a to me
unknown explorer 'Vertomannus'. Only when I started reading I realized that
it was the Latin version of the name of the person I knew under the Italian
version Ludovico di Varthema.

The second exception are kings in general - for example, all French kings
with the name Louis, all the way upto the French revolution, are in Dutch
called Lodewijk.

There was a brief debate recently about this in Norway - apparently the
language council _still_ recommends Norwegianizing names of royals, at
least after their death.  The starting point of the debate being that the
current crown prince does not spell his name according to current spelling
rules (his name as he spells it is Haakon Magnus, but "aa" was changed to
"å" in a spelling reform early this century.)  So _his_ name too would be
changed after his death... :-)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I can't see where you get the idea that I've made any such assumption.
Monopoly has the flaw - Cosmic Encounter and Settlers of Catan do not
have it, are better games for not having it. My legislative ideas, and
those of others who share my views on this subject, are informed by a
desire to avoid entrenching this flaw in Agora. When you complain that
this or that idea is bad or weird or stupid or wrong because it
introduces a check on the rich getting endlessly richer, you seem to me
to be doing everything you can to make sure that Monopoly's flaw *does*
get entrenched in Agora.

If you reread my post you will see that I quite specifically allowed for
"moderate and temporary inequities", and objected only to "massive and
persistent inequities".

Of course, "persistent" has a different meaning in Monopoly than it does
in Agora, for the reason I noted: a game of Monopoly lasts for some
hours, while Agora could in theory be played until the extinction in our
Universe of sentient beings to play it.

Of course they don't *have* to be persistent - but they *will* be unless
measures are introduced to prevent it. And you have a history of
opposing all such measures.

You're talking to the wrong guy - I'm not the one who has proposed to
repeal Currencies completely and move onto a completely different system
of tradeable rights. I'm with you - I wish people would give the current
system some time to run its course before grandly prnouncing it a
failure and proposing to replace it with something different.

Protoproposal Chaos242 [rev. 1]

Categorical Redundance?

Be it resolved, that Rules 1048 and 1691 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A new Rule shall be assigned to:
        (1) the Rule Category specified by the Instrument that created
            the Rule, if that Rule Category exists; otherwise
        (2) a Rule Category chosen by the Rulekeepor at eir
            discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (c) The Rulekeepor may delete an empty Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (d) The Rulekeepor may change the name of a Rule Category
          Without Objection.

      (e) The Rulekeepor may change the Rule Category to which a given
          Rule is assigned Without Objection.

[ Comment: Rules 1691 and 1048 are somewhat redundant in their present
  form.  This proto seeks to eliminate the redundancy and clean up
  things a bit. ]

While I believe that you are so deathly afraid of the "Monopoly flaw"
that you squelch anything that might possibly create even a transient
inequity before it has a chance to do anything interesting at all.

I have a history of opposing measures that are calculated to render
our fledging economy meaningless.  So far, you've proposed a number of 
such measures, and as a result at the moment our economy is largely
meaningless.

You've never given it a chance.  Everytime the system gets a bit out
of balance (as defined by you) you propose either a complete wipe or a 
repressive "taxation" system to ensure that any slight inequity is
squlched in the bud before it can become interesting.

Apparently you missed the lecture in economics about how economies are 
driven by the unequal distribution of resources.  Since you insist on
an equal distribution of resources, you doom the economy to
stagnation.

Yeah - I am particularly pleased about the way this makes the Registrar
a kind of representative for the unemployed (unwashed? :) masses. And e
cannot use eir power to directly benefit emself.

Actually, this is a bit of a simplistic calculation. In reality we currently
pay out 19 times the BOS every month, distributed among only 15 players. If
we are to balance this input, we will need to spend an average of 1.3 VTs
each a week. I might have to push the tariff up a little more.

Hardly idiotic, but maybe we can do better. What kind of thing did you

But this shows the problem with Monthly Salaries. We cannot spend 1.3
VTs a week, no matter how high you push the Tariff, because we don't
have the VTs to spend, and will not do so until the first week of April.
Since Voting Debts are assessed weekly, we cannot spend on credit now,
safe in the knowledge that we will be paid in a month. Either Voting
Debts must be assessed monthly, or Salaries must be paid weekly. I
prefer the latter option. But even the former would be better than the
status quo, which is untenable.

Proto to appear shortly.  I am proposing doing away with the "Voting
Token Circulation Level" and instead forcing the Chancellor to use
taxes to ensure that e has enough funds to pay the Bank's debts.

Protoproposal Chaos243 [rev. 1]

Taxes, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      (a) The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Bank is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as
          the Bank's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute
          it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not
          do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      (c) If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for
          any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except
          when specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer
          Order), e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and
          upon conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]

Unless, of course, the Accountor raises the VTCL to a sufficiently
large value that no tax will be imposed.

Obviously. What I meant was that _in_April_ I may have to raise the tariff.
Clearly increased output must follow increased input, not precede it.

Not at all. Many people in the real world happily get paid monthly, but
buy their groceries weekly. There is no reason why Agora could not work
the same way. Okay, so it will make tuning the economy a little trickier,
but not overly so, as long as we realise what we are dealing with.

No, you miss the point. We don't have to spend 1.3 VTs a week _now_. 
We will have to spend it in April. Assuming that the VTCL is raised, that
is. If it remains at the level it is, then a lot of VTs will be taken 
out due to taxes, so we will not have to spend nearly as much. So keeping
the VTCL low is a solution of sorts, but not a good one.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]

Just to check that I understand this:

What you're proposing is a limit on the powers of the Chancellor to
keep minting more and more Currency, by making it WO. So to avoid PI
penalties for bank debts, e is allowed to levy taxes to raise funds.
The nature of taxes appears to be more or less up to eir discretion -
it can be anything up to fifty percent, and their can be an arbitrary
cut off values for tax-exemption (which can differ for player and non-
player entities).

Hsm. I like it in principle, but I think the discretionary tax-exemptions
are too open to abuse. It would be too easy to victimise a small group
of players. There should be more checks and balances. 

Although, I suppose there is one vulnerability - if a player refuses to
pay eir Taxes, then the Chancellor is somewhat at eir mercy. Assuming e
only levied as much tax as e needed, e is relying on everyone paying up.
If someone holds out, then the Bank remains in debt, and the Chancellor
faces PI penalties. Either e has to make up the difference by taxing
the rest of the players even more, or e has to mint more currency, to 
which the recalcitrant Player can always object.

This could bring about a very interesting kind of standoff. I'd love
to see how it played out in practice.

The problem with a low VTCL is that we're forced to spend our Salaries 
immediately.  In fact, if the VTCL is sufficiently low, we have our
Salaries taken away from us before we can spend them at all.
