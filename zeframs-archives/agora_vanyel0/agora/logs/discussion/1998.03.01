And what happens to a newly-created Factory?  Who, if anyone,
owns it?  Please specify.

Other nomics have more than enough silliness to make up for
our lack thereof, anyway. :)

Interesting mechanism, Scott, but you have left out the all-important
diversity penalty. If we want to encourage trade, we need to have
an imbalance of supply. Plot's attempted to encourage players to specialise
in producing one particular commodity by charging 1 extra Erg for each
type of Structure a player owned. 

I'm not sure how you could include this in your proto, but I think its
important.

Also, I really don't see the point of Location. I'd rather forget about
it until we have a real use for it.
