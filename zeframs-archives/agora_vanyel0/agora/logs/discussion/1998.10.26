No.  He was on hold during the middle of the week (from the 18th to
the 23rd), but the Election started on the 17th.

I've been thinking that the Rules should require the Recordkeepor to accept
POs and TOs by the current method but allow them to designate without
objection other methods by which they can be made.   This would ensure that
POs and TOs are always possible but free Recordkeepors to experiment with
other ways of handling them.

Actually "A Duty to Vote" is ambiguously worded ("... and who fails to cast
a vote on any Proposal in the batch, ...") and it could be interpreted as
requiring a vote on every Proposal in every batch.

I will vote AGAINST any future proposal with language like "fails to X any
Y" where it is not indisputably clear which of the two meanings is to be
taken.

But the "buggy revolution effects" *are* part of the economy.
<<

Not anymore ;)

>>
In fact, I think my stance is entirely opposite to this.  The erasure
of blots due to revolution is akin to abrogating debts in bankruptcy,
which does in fact create inflation in real economies
<<

My interpretation of your opinion was this: It is a bad idea to delete
blots after a revolution. Your arguments concerning loans and
inflation seem to me to confirm my interpretation of your preferences:
you'd rather not see such ad hoc changes happen.

If this is true, I also understand why you don't like the indulgence
tax after a revolution, because it is a similarly ad hoc manipulation
of the economy.

What I wanted to say was that I accept your opposition to ad hoc
manipulations in general, but I think that in the present context of
post-revolution events the overall effect on the economy is much worse
if there is _only_ a blots amnesty. A blots amnesty combined with an
indulgence tax may be against your principles, but at least the
combination of the two does less damage than the blots amnesty
alone. That was all I wanted to say.

>>
This is not necessary for there to be trade in indulgences.  All that
is required is that there be Players who need more indulgences than
they have.  It is not necessary that the economy _as a whole_ be
critically scarce; that just raises need to the level of desparation.
<<

You have a point here, of course. But on the other hand it seems to me
that we all do need a lot of pressure to do things - even voting and
proposing are being made compulsory to spur people into more active
participation in the game. If there are 30 or so indulgences around
(as there were after the last revolution), then for a very long time
there will hardly ever be anyone who really needs indulgences - and
that means that a lot of recordkeeping, report publishing etc is just
red tape without effect.

I can see legitimate arguments both ways; hence, I will leave that

Actually, I do not hold this opinion.  I have no problem with deleting

Not really, no.  The indulgence tax (and, in fact, all the taxes
established to date) is definitely an ad hoc manipulation of the
economy to which I would object; however, I would not characterize it
as "similar" to the post-revolution blot amnesty.  Part of this
distinction arises from the fact that indulgences and blots are
disparate entities.  I also think the amnesty make sense in light of
what a revolution is supposed to be.

Hmm.  You already paid this PO off in a message with the following header info:

I transfer 1 Indulgence to the Bank to pay this PO.

RE: DIS: Failure to Report?

Of course none of this will ease a Recordkeepor's burden unless all (or at
least most) Players use the method preferred by that Recordkeepor.  That's not
to say that these are necessarily bad ideas, just that they won't necessarily
make the Accountor's job any easier.

I've been thinking that the Rules should require the Recordkeepor to accept
POs and TOs by the current method but allow them to designate without
objection other methods by which they can be made.   This would ensure that
POs and TOs are always possible but free Recordkeepors to experiment with
other ways of handling them.

I think I would go farther, but how far I'm not sure.  I want to get
rid of Transfer Orders because they're clearly not well suited to the
order paradigm; I am thinking that Payment Orders also need
adjustment.  I'm thinking that a general concept of alienable property
needs to be developed, at which point Payment Orders amount to the
transfer of legal right to a piece of property from the payor to the
payee.  I'll have to think about this more after torts....

I agree with you, that is is ambiguous.  What would you suggest as a

My idea is to allow the Recordkeepors to experiment and perhaps come upon a
method of handling these things that is better both for the Recordkeepor and
for the players.  Once this is achieved to a reasonable level of
satisfaction, we can then allow the Recordkeepors to choose if they will
utilize the current method at all at any given time.  At this point in the
plan the Rules don't even need to mention the current method.  They will
only need to require that all Recordkeepors have a method in place that
actually allows TOs and POs to be executed.

Essentially, what I'm talking about is a near total deregulation of these
mechanisms.  Leave it to the individuals who have to do the work to choose
how they will do things and let the courts determine if the chosen method is
adequate.

I too would go farther.  My idea was really only one about how to deregulate
things a little to allow experimentation.  If we find that it works to allow
Recordkeepors a greater degree of freedom in choosing how they do business,
we can then deregulate entirely and remove any mention of specific
mechanisms from the Rules.  All that is necessary is to require the
Recordkeepor, by whatever means, to publish a correct report of the portion
of the game state for which they are responsible.

I agree with these sentiments.  In fact, it seems to me that relaxing the
requirement that  Recordkeepors employ the TO/PO mechanism during the
experimentation I suggest would be desirable.  Without this I suspect that
it will be difficult at best to allow sufficient freedom for the experiment
to produce meaningful results.

Will this actually decrease the paperwork involved?  I mean what difference
in the volume of work is there between a transfer of a currency and a
transfer of legal rights to a currency?

The problem as I see it is that, for the most part, real world objects
maintain there own state (e.g. a coin can only be in one person's pocket at
a time) while our entities do not (i.e. we must constantly record the game
state for fear of losing it).  As I see it we need to put in place
mechanisms that make the states of these entities as automatically seen as
is possible.  Thus I have for a while now favored the idea of an automated
server to maintain currency billings and transfers.  Set up properly we
could always know in whose pocket a VT is.

With an automated server to maintain currency billing and transfers, we
could easily provide plenty of incentive for people to use the system.  Near
instant reports of currency balances and outstanding POs alone make the
system very valuable.  The Recordkeepor could set things up so that only
those who use the system all the time are eligible to receive these
automated benefits.  However, once such a mechanism was successfully in
place, I would go further.  I would allow the Recordkeepor to cease using
the traditional mechanisms altogether.  After all, no one can really claim
hardship if required to email their TO/PO to the server, now can they?

I've sent you (privately) a draft of the start of a system I've been

I'm mulling this issue at the moment.  I've actually decided to write
Rules that would work if we used physical objects as currencies and
then tacking on just enough recordkeeping to accomplish the desired
effects.

Hm, you're right about the ambiguity. The interpretation which would
have the Rule requiring a vote on every Proposal in the batch did not
occur to me when I was drafting the Rule - I would have used 'every' if
that had been my intent. "...some Proposal in the batch" would have been
clearer. I should probably propose a clarification.

I have some questions about this Judgement:

1. Why does Judge Morendil think that Blob's report of the Infraction
falls under the purview of R1768? The Office of Assessor does not have
associated with it an Official Report, and according to R1686, "The only
information that is part of an Official Report is that which the Rules
specifically state is part of that Official Report." I take the mention
in R1768 of "the published Report of an Officer" to refer to that
Office's Official Report, if any.

2. I agree with Judge Morendil that what is important in determining
whether a Player has a duty to vote is simply the number of VTs over
which e has effective control at the time a Proposal is distributed. I
therefore find it puzzling that he did not find it necessary to make
enquiries of the Accountor as to how many VTs General Chaos actually
possessed when Proposals 3794-3795 were distributed. This information
would seem to me to be of the utmost relevance. Judge Morendil's
assertion that the Assessor's determination creates a presumption of
truth is neither here nor there: the point of the General's CFJ is
precisely to call that presumption into question. In so doing, he made
an inquiry into the facts (rather than the presumptions of fact) of the
case unavoidable.

For the moment, I will refrain from appealing the Judgement, and instead
direct a question to the Accountor: how many VTs did general Chaos
possess at the time Proposals 3794-3795 were distributed, ie, at Fri, 9
Oct 1998 08:48:55 GMT?
