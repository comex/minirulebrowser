It says in e-mail headers, if you look ;)

I don't like the sunset clauses at all.  If people want this change,
let them vote for it.  If we implement it, and then decide we don't
want it, we can either try and get rid of it piece-meal which will
probably lead to an interesting ruleset, or we can figure out the old
state of the rules concerned by just looking at a relevant ruleset.  

I don't think this unnecessarily centralises existing powers overly
much.  Sure the Registrar loses their recently gained ability to set
unemployment rates, but as you have already pointed out, the change
gives something to the Treasuror that we haven't been able to fiddle
with to date, and that is the BOS rates for the various Offices.  

Keep the new spelling of the Office, but get rid of the sunset clauses
and go for it. 

Michael.

Indeed.  I never had a nickname either.  For the purposes of the
Registrar's report, it is useful to have a unique one-word identifier
("General Chaos" and "Kolja A." are mildly annoying to have to deal
with :-), but David is not taken, so I have used that for the moment.
If you want another, please let me know. 

Michael.

Well, even I voted for this.  Although the reasons for doing so at 
that time might not of been very clearly thought out.

Really?  In that case I'd like to be known as Beefurabbi if that's
allright with everyone.
