I disagree; all six are made by the Repeal-o-Matic.  As I've
previously noted, nothing prohibits the Repeal-o-Matic from making
Proposals (via its Executor, of course) other than those specifically
required by the Repeal-o-Matic Rule.  IMO, Rule 116 applies.

Ah. But Crito just made it clear that e was not, in fact, acting as
the ROM's Executor. You inferred that because you *thought* Rule 1753
required ROM Proposals to be submitted by the ROM under the
Executive responsibility of the Promotor, but that happens not to be
the case.

I would therefore submit that merely alluding to a Rule that allows,
or requires, a Player to act as an Entity's Executor is *not*
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 1478.

I vehemently disagree that Crito made it "clear" that e was acting
as the ROM's Executor. There has been quite enough confusion on that
score - especially on Crito's part - to make me convinced of that by
now. Rule 1478 applies.

Interesting. You appear to be right; Proposals submitted by the ROM
as per 1753 are Rule-mandated acts of the ROM, and do not require
the Promotor to act as the ROM's Executor. In the absence of the
Executive Misconduct legislation that Scott alluded to, however, it
would appear that your being the Executor of the ROM allows you to
submit Proposals on the ROM's behalf whenever you so choose, without
incurring a penalty for, say, Excess Proposing, as that is assessed
against the Proposing Entity itself rather than its Executor. 

There remains the question of whether you Proposed all six Proposals
yourself, on your own behalf, or were merely reporting the fact that
the ROM had submitted them - well, two of them, rather - as you
Scott argues your introductory comment about 'discharging your
responsibilities wrt the Repeal-O-Matic' constitutes an indication
of.

Then you should have referenced Tardiness rather than Executive Misconduct. 
Under the circumstances, I would view this kind of prosecution as mean spirited

Rule 1483 may be clear on this, but R1753 is also clear, without, I think,
being in conflict with 1483 - it says that the Repeal-O-Matic proposals are
deemed to be submitted at the time of selection, not at the time the PF
received my posting about it.  IMO, your attempts to attach legal significance
to that posting are in error, since this was an informational message, not the
submission of proposals.

Actually, I think you are correct wrt the ability of the Promotor to submit
additional proposals on behalf of the ROM.  As Executor of the Repeal-O-Matic,
I may submit any number of proposals on it's behalf at any time, for any
reason.  It is only the weekly selection process that is mandated and
restricted.  (Other than the normal "too many proposals" restriction.)

>I fully expect to see all six Proposals included in the next
>distribution.

Then you will be disappointed.  The message you saw was not a proposal
submission, but an informational message describing the result of six different
applications of the ROM rule selection process.  Only the last two such
selections had any real, legal significance.  Anyone may select 5 Rules at
random at any time, select one to three of them and then attempt to claim that
this should be deemed to be a submission of proposals to the Promotor.  But
they would be mistaken, unless this process was performed by the Promotor under
the auspices of R1753, as only the last two of my selection processes were.

This is where we disagree.  It was clear to me what I was doing - letting
everyone know, prior to distribution, exactly what proposals were generated by
the Repeal-O-Matic.  And I was doing that in my capacity as Promotor, not as
Executor of the ROM.

Maybe.  But I think you are still missing the point here.  The purpose of the
deemed time of submission is to alleviate the need for the Promotor to send a
message to emself, which I think is a good idea.  There is nothing in the Rules
to prevent the Promotor from sending a post to the PF, prior to distribution,
letting people know what proposals have been submitted and what their text is
(e.g. those proposals that some, like yourself, submit to me directly rather
than trough the PF).  This does not constitute either making a proposal or
making a distribution, if clearly labeled as such.  My ROM posting was clearly
labeled as such.

I would say that my post had a clear indication that the text delivered in the
message was *not* intended to become a Proposal, but was text already made into
a Proposal by the ROM - a claim that turned out to be incorrect for all but two
of the proposals described in the text.

The statement that a message contains Proposals is sufficient to make
the contents Proposals.  See Rule 1482.

I've seen Rule 1482 and there is no conflict.  I've already responded to this
in a prior post.  See Rule 1483 - "clear indication that the text is intended
to become a proposal".  My message had no such indication - as a matter of
fact, it had a clear indication that the text was already "submitted" as a
proposal and was informational only.

As you say.  Fixed in the latest version. 

Thanks,

PS: as it stands the Cartographor could and should be merged into the

The situations you wax lyrical about so effectively: errors in game
states.  Why put ourselves through the reconstruction of three weeks
of game history?  By having to go back and fix things that far back,
we're just making the game unnecessarily tedious.

Ah, yes, I thought it was you that originally made the PO.  I remember
now that it was not.  Perhaps I should have admitted the claim while I
was still Assessor :-).  I guess I could bring it into dispute by
COEing on it, but knowing Scott's attitude to the use of COEs to
establish law, I think I'll just try and come up with that properly
worded CFJ.

Thanks for getting back to me so promptly,
Michael.

I think it is a big mistake to conflate the notion of possession with
that of Mule allocation to Plots.  Despite the similarities at one
level, the two things are really quite different and I don't think
it's wise to muddle things up in this way.  It may work now, but the
similarities may go away, and then we'll be left in the unpleasant
situation of having to update Currencies to also keep Plots working,
or vice versa.  The CompSci phrase is "clean separation of concerns". 

In any case, I can't see that the system needs much complicated
machinery.  The Cartographor needs to be able to bill people who are
maintaining Mules (I think I preferred the notion of buildings
somehow; "Mules" keeps on making me think of telepathic psychopaths),
and people need to be able to tell the Cartographor what their
allocation is to be, which in turn will cost them money.  There will
have to be some sort of Official Document that the C. maintains with
this information in it, and the Cartographor will have to pay out the
returns on people's investments, but there's not much more to it than
that. 

While you're fiddling with the Cartographor, could you simultaneously
get rid of Locations?  They seem to me to be a waste of time.

Michael.

They're not.  File your appeal promptly.  Filing the appeal will stay
the execution of the sentence, so you'll be allowed to vote during the
pendency of litigation.  IMO, if you can't be bothered to file a
prompt appeal, you don't deserve voting privileges.

In this case, the penalty will be imposed by an Administrative Order,
so the appeal is by CFJ alleging that the Order is improperly issued.

Crito must deny this COE.  An Order was issued, and Crito's act of
recording it, and reporting its existence, is legally correct.

In order to accomplish your desired goal, you must allege that the
Assessor was improper in issuing it, and pray for it to be vacated.
Challenging the Promotor for recording the Order is misdirected.

Rule 1670 has been disinfected for a while; you should recommence

FYI, R1670 was disinfected on Dec 18; I'm probably owed a stipend

Is this your way of saying that don't accept Jeff's argument in
whatever recent CFJ it was regarding R833?

What happened there? You originally reported that Michael did not vote
on P3538, presumably because he was not a Frankenstein Monster at the
time. You have since revised the Report to include Michael's votes.
Why the change?

I don't have a clear mandate, either judicial or legislative.

Opposed.  This fails to scale for the number of Players (if we have 25
Players, that only allows for 8 VTs each, which is not many at all).
In addition, the determination of whether or not to issue the Orders
will be somewhat onerous, and will become even more so should we
divorce Proposal Vote Collecting from VT Recordkeeping.  Issues of
uncertainty in Currency holdings may also cause problems.  Finally,
the number of Voting Tokens not held by the Bank is subject to a
substantial degree of manipulation by the payors of outstanding
Payment Orders, especially the Bank.  (The Bank just paid out 315.5
VTs in Payment Orders.)

I neglected to account for the mutation of the Frankenstein Rule to
remove the restriction of voting privileges to Frankenstein Monsters,
reported by Oerjan on 17 Dec 1997.  As a result, a number of Votes (by
Morendil, Michael, and possibly Murphy) were improperly disregarded.
