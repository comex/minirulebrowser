PROTO: Electees v0.9
####

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office, but continues
      to hold the Office temporarily. When an Electee to an Office 
      is removed from that Office, the Speaker shall become the 
      temporary holder of that Office, unless another Rule specifies 
      a different Player who is to become the temporary holder of 
      that Office. 

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall immediately cease to be Electee to all Offices e
      is Electee to, and shall be removed from all Offices e
      holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who retires from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e retires. In this case,
      the retiring Player ceases to be Electee to that Office;
      if the named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be
      successor to the Office, the named successor becomes 
      holder of the Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

with the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

      and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

with the text:

      and the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by its Electee.

and the text:

      only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion

with the text:

      only until the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by an
      Electee who is not the Speaker.

{Comments:

This is a first shot at writing the Office rules to use the "Electee"
terminology. I'm sure there are problems with it, but that's what protoing
is for...
}

Ah. I had failed to account for CFJ 1088.

Hmmmm, synchronicity. I'm just now putting the finishing touches on
own version of these ideas. Oh well, compare and contrast. In some
areas I feel you've done better than me, in others I feel I've done
better than you. With your permission, I may adopt bits of yours
where I feel you've done better for my proto. Between us, we should
be able to come up with something good.

Potentially confusing, since the Electee might not be holding the Office
when e retires, eg in the case when the ToS expires during a PoD, in 
which case he won't be "continuing" to hold the Office. In this case,
I think the Player actually holding the Office should continue to do
so.

Similar remarks apply: what if an Impeachment Referendum passes during
a PoD? It makes more sense (ie less Officer Transitions) for the
Player holding the Office to continue holding it.

These are better than the corresponding passages in my proto, so
in they go.

You've deleted the definition of holding an Office in the
normal fashion. I've modified and retained it, as a number of other
Rules make use of it.

I hadn't gotten around to writing this part. But this looks fine.
Cut and paste!

I don't see the point of this amendment, since being an Officer holding
and Office in the normal fashion is equivalent to being an Electee of
that Office who is actually holding the Office...oh, I get it, you have
to do this because you've gotten rid of the definition of "normal fashion".
That's why I chose to retain it.

I've handled this quite differently, in too many ways to detail.

Proto-Proposal
Officer Reform

[Comment: following the plan sketched by Oerjan on Feb 16, I present
a bill for Officer Reform. With thanks to Harlequin, from whom I have
occasionally stolen. Most of the work is original with me, however.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "Electees" be created with
the following text:

      An Electee is a Player who has been Elected to hold an Office,
      and who has not resigned from that Office, been retired from
      it, or been removed from it. An Office has an Electee if there
      is such a Player. Nevertheless, an Electee need not actually be
      holding the Office for which e is an Electee; another Player
      might be holding the Office, for example because the Office is
      Delegated. 

Be it further resolved that R1006 (Defaults for Officers) be amended 
by appending to the paragraph which reads:

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

a sentence which reads:

      A Player who holds an Office is said to be Serving in that
      Office.

Be it further resolved that R1645 (Temporary Delegation of Office) be
amended by replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      The Period of Delegation concludes two weeks after the Period
      of Delegation commences, or at the end of the Term of Service
      for the Delegated Office, or at the time (if any) specified by
      the Delegating Player, whichever is earliest.

with text which reads:

      The Period of Delegation concludes two weeks after the Period
      of Delegation commences, or at the time (if any) specified by
      the Delegating Player in the Notice of Delegation, whichever is
      earliest. In addition, the Period of Delegation shall immmediately 
      conclude if the Delegating Player posts a Notice of Resumption
      of Office to the Public Forum, stating that e is resuming eir
      duties with respect to the Delegated Office. The Period of
      Delegation shall also immediately conclude if the Delegated
      Player ceases to hold the Office, or if the Office has no Electee.

and by replacing the text which currently reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player
      resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion, unless the
      Term of Service for that Office has expired, or a Revolt
      occurred during the Period of Delegation. If the Term of
      Service expired, the Delegated Player continues to hold the
      Office temporarily, although the Office ceases to be a
      delegated Office. If a Revolt occurred during the Period of
      Delegation, and at the end of the Period of Delegation no other
      Player is holding the Office in the normal fashion, the
      Delegating Player resumes holding the Office, but temporarily,

with a new paragraph which reads:

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, one of the following
      occurs:

      if the Delegating Player is still the Electee of the Office,
      then the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Office and the
      Delegating Player resumes holding the Office in the normal
      fashion;

      if the Delegating Player is not the Electee of the Office and
      the Delegated Player is not otherwise prevented from holding
      the Office, then the Delegated Player continues to hold the
      Office temporarily;

      if the Delegating Player is not the Electee of the Office and
      the Delegated Player is no longer a Player or is otherwise
      prevented from holding the Office, then the Speaker holds the
      Office temporarily.

[Comment: that was *not* easy to write, and I may not have got it
quite right yet. There are so many cases to consider! Still, I
think this will work. Cases are now covered which are not covered
by R1645 at present, such as the Delegated Player resigning or
going On Hold, or the Delegating Player deregistering. Expiry of Term
of Service, or a Revolt, or the resignation or deregistration of the
Delegating Player now causes the PoD to immediately conclude, with
Office staying with the Delegated Player if possible, or going to the
Speaker if not. I've also added a provision allowing the Delegating
Player to end the PoD early by posting a Notice of Resumption of
Office to the PF. In any case, I invite people to test these
provisions by thinking up the most twisted and bizarre combinations
of circumstances they can imagine and seeing how the provisions will
deal with them. They've passed all the tests I've thought of so far,
but what about the tests I haven't thought of?]

Be it further resolved that R1664 (Rebellion) be amended by replacing
the text in it which currently reads:

         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.

with text which reads:

         - All Electees are retired from their Offices and cease to
           be Electees.

[Comment: this assumes that P3707 (Risky Rebellion) passes.]

Be it further resolved that R790 (Filling Vacant Offices) be amended
to read:

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Office has an Electee who is Serving in that Office. An Office
      which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be held
      temporarily.

      As soon as possible after it occurs that there is an Office
      which has no Electee, and for which no Election is already
      being conducted, the Registrar shall initiate an Election to
      fill that Office, as described elsewhere.  However, if the
      Office in question is that of the Registrar, the Speaker shall
      instead initiate the Election.  The winner of the Election
      for that Office becomes the Electee of that Office.

Be it further resolved that R1555 (Retirement and Removal from
Offices) be amended to read:

      When a Serving Electee is retired from an Office, e ceases to
      hold it in the normal fashion, but continues to hold the Office
      temporarily. When a non-Serving Electee is retired from Office,
      the Player who is Serving in that Office continues to hold the
      hold the Office temporarily.

      When a Serving Electee is removed from Office, the Speaker
      shall become the temporary holder of that Office, unless
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become the
      temporary holder of that Office. When a non-Serving Electee
      is removed from Office, the Player Serving in that Office
      continues to hold the Office temporarily. 

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall be held normally by the Electee of that Office, if
      there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall be held
      temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered,
      e shall immediately cease to be Electee to all Offices e
      is Electee to, and shall be removed from all Offices e
      holds.

Be it further resolved that R1556 (Terms of Service for Offices)
be amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service, the Officer
      holding that Office shall be retired from that Office.

with text which reads:

      Upon the expiry of an Office's Term of Service, the Electee
      of that Office shall be retired from that Office.

Be it further resolved that R1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer)
be amended to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called
      for the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include
      the Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio
      must be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Be it further resolved that R910 (The Justiciar) be amended by 
replacing the text in it which currently reads:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with text which reads:

      If the Electee of the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

Be it further resolved that R1450 (Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or
Justiciar) be amended to read:

      The Speaker shall never hold either of the Office of Clerk of
      the Courts or the Office of Justiciar in the normal fashion. If
      the Electee of either the Clerk of the Courts or the Justiciar
      becomes Speaker, e is immediately retired from whichever of
      those Offices e holds.

[Comment: So,: if A is the Justiciar Electee, and B the Justiciar-
Delegate, and A becomes Speaker, then the PoD for Justiciar ends
immediately, A is retired as Justiciar, and B continues on as
temporary Justiciar, which I think is the best outcome. If *B*
becomes Speaker, then e will be simultaneously Speaker and
Justiciar until an Election can be completed, in which B will
not be allowed to nominate. Same as the way the Rule works now.]

This goes well with my proto 'Encourage VT spending'.

Do we therefore make a Rule that says no player may own more
than 10 Zagrebs, since owning more than 10 Zagrebs may, in
some possible Rulesets, lead to a scam?

Bad news--the typo *does* appear in Blob's distribution of
the Proposal as I received it.  Will look into possible consequences
later.

Fair enough. I readily grant that if that is our reading of 206,
then your conclusions follow, and the wording differences between
1766 and 1660 are indeed inconsequential. I'm glad that in the course 
of this discussion we have steered our focus away from these 
particular Rules, where I believe it does not belong, and to 206.

I was, however, under the impression that this second rephrasing
took more liberties with the actual text of Rule 206 than my earlier
rephrasings did.

I think your tenses need tightening here.  In particular, I think you
should insert a "subsequently" into your first sentence.

I think you need to specify that the Electee comes to hold the Office
at this point.  None of your other rules specify the way in which an
Electee does so (unless they Delegate first :-)

This Rule seems to be OK as written because it covers the possible
permutations of "Delegating Player still Electee" and "Delegated
Player eligible to hold Office".  On the other hand, your use of the
word "still" makes it seem as if a case has been missed (the case of a
Revolt occurring, and the Delegating Player being re-elected to the
Office all while the PoD lasts).  But then we check back and see that
the PoD immediately ends if it comes about that there is not an
Electee for an Office.  So, the word "still" is redundant (and
possibly a little misleading).  Could it be done away with?

I'd prefer you to explicitly add here (as you did in the Rebellion
rule) that the Electee ceases to be such (in both cases).  (Without
this provision, the retirement of a non-standing Electee doesn't alter
anything; a pretty serious bug.  For example, I can delegate just
before my Term of Service is due to expire.  Then all the rule says is
that the person holding the Office continues to do so temporarily.
When their PoD expires, I am reinstalled, pretty much in Perpetuity
because the term of service rule won't fire again. 

In fact, it seems to me that you don't need the concepts of "holding
an Office in normal fashion" and "holding an Office temporarily"
despite your comments to Harlequin.  In a couple of places you have
"resumes holding the Office in the normal fashion".  This can be
shortened to "resumes holding the Office".

Elsewhere: in R1555 above you should just say that when an Electee is
retired, they cease to be the Electee for their Office.

The only other occurrence of "normal fashion" in your reworked rules,
is the rule preventing Speaker being CotC or Justiciar.  This can be
worded as 

  "If the Electee of either the Clerk of the Courts or the Justiciar
   becomes Speaker, e is immediately retired from whichever of those
   Offices e is Electee for."

(This also fixes a bug in your proposed fix to R1450, which wouldn't
retire the CotC Electee when they became Speaker if someone else was
holding CotC temporarily.)

Other occurrences of "normal fashion" in the ruleset are:

In the Perpetuity Rule (R1758):
  Your proposal would not allow Chuck to Delegate as it stands, and
  I'd simply suggest that the first sentence of R1758 be altered to
    "If an Office is held by its Electee, then...
     ... until such time as there is no Electee to that Office."

In the Dereliction of duty rule (R1644)

   Dereliction of duty shouldn't talk about "normal fashion" at all,
   as it absolves delegated Officers from the risk of committing the
   Infraction of Dereliction of Duty.

In the Right to Call Elections (R1659)
  
   Again, shouldn't be restricted to offices held in the normal
   fashion anyway.  Should be "lists a number of Offices with
   Electees" along with "all such Electees listed in this post ceases
   to be Electees for their respective Offices."

When the Speaker is Tainted (R1648)
   
   Should (could) just be rephrased in terms of whether or not there
   is an Electee for the Office of Speaker-Elect holding that Office. 

That's it.  I don't know that "normal fashion" is used often enough to
warrant defining it as an abbreviation, particularly as it is used
incorrectly in a couple of places.  Similarly the notion of
"temporarily"  can be dropped entirely.  (The only possible
complication is in the rules for the Office of Speaker-Elect, but I
still reckon just removing the word "temporarily" wherever it appears
would be safe.)

So, my recommendation is to get rid of both concepts. 

Michael.

There always has to be a first. Why shouldn't it be Blob ?  If e's
worthy of the position e'll win it back again no problem.

Yes, I realise that my failure to vote had political implications. But
that is one unfortunate aspect of any election. Any action/inaction will
be political. The way I see it is that any action clearly implies
support while inaction, though it may have political implications, does
not imply support for the political system which I am against.

I believed this game was about the ruleset. I would like to believe that
decisions regarding the game were made on logical grounds, not on
political grounds. A rule change, officer election, CFJ, COE, or any
other aspect of the game requiring decision should be judged on how it
affects the game, not on the persons or groups concerned. This spills
out into the real world and explains why I hate politics. I don't claim
to be totally objective when I make decisions, but I try to be fairly
objective. 

As it would seem that I am sadly mistaken regarding the role of politics
in Agora, I see this as another reason to consider leaving Agora.

> Out of curiousity, does that rule out bribes?

Yes !  It does rule out bribes directly. However, if the bribe was
accompanied with what appeared to me to be good reasoning then I may be
swayed. Incidentally, I was considering accepting the anti-threat
argument, for the reason stated above, but missed the deadline, due to
being busy with other things. 

FWIW (by way of explanation) In the last few weeks I have built 4 sets
of adjustable shelves (only my second ever attempt at carpentry),
scrubbed down the outside of the house, totally revamped my scout badge
collection, and am currently reorganising the furniture, restoring 6-10
pieces of furniture, building a 1:12 scale wooden model, and revamping
my Promo card collection. All this while still doing my full-time job,
participating in two church groups and finishing an old computing
certificate.  I am not run off my feet, but I do find it hard to find an
extra hour or two each day for Agora (or for changing my tagline - :o).

I thought I could try to write up a Proto after I finish Spring Cleaning. 
(Version 2 of that Proto will be out the door as soon as I get the time to

Darn.  Teach me to finish reading my mail before responding.  Or at least
browse the subjects.

Being immensely lazy I do not really mind Steve taking over this.

In conjunction with a previous message of Sherlock's, I am assuming
that this resignation message appoints me as successor.  I think we
may pushing the edge of legality in doing so, but I'd be grateful if
Players accepted it as having the desired effect.  Of course, if this
action is claimed to be in error, and the courts accept the argument,
it will be all my own fault that I have to conduct an Election because
I delegated to Sherlock for far too long.  I certainly won't blame
anyone if they feel that this is a step too far, and demand an
Election for the Office of Cartographor.

Incidentally, if and when Plots passes, and assuming I'm still in the
Office, I will resign from Cartographor so as to give us a chance to
elect someone to fill all of the relevant duties that the Office will
acquire as a result of the new rules. 

Michael.

Steve, would you double-check your distribution from Blob?
It seems a bit unlikely that some (more than one) people
would recieve it with the typo, and others without.

If Blob's distribution did have the typo in it as e sent
it to a-o, then I would submit that P3710 has not yet
been distributed.

OTOH, if Blob's distribution was correct, and some people
received a mangled form while others did not, then the
Proposal was clearly distributed, but the creation of
"A Monument to the Threat" may fall afoul of R107.

Actually, 'Encourage VT spending' would make the above redundant.

And almost every Proposal would _still_ give Zeitgeist awards - forcing
people to use more FOR Votes doesn't mean people will be more inclined to 
vote AGAINST.

I suspect that Zeitgeist doesn't really make much sense in our VT-poor
environment.  Nor does 'Encourage VT spending', for that matter.


But here is another idea:  Remove Presence.

We don't really need it any more, with all the other tools available to
reduce Quorum, even completely if everyone agrees.

Tools which I'm not fond of, as they circumvent the purpose
of Quorum (at least as Quorum is used in RL situations.)

There is a fundamental difference between loopholes that may be possible
under some very specific Rules but not under most situations (your
Zagrebs) and loopholes that will be possible under many general situations
but not under our current specific Rules (the Many Proposals Voting Scam,
and Electioneering.)

I got a sudden insight.  Better post before I start doubting.

When the main problem with a political system is that it _doesn't care_
about its subjects, then inaction _does_ imply support, because it is
exactly what the system wants.

Same here.

Maybe Oerjan, as our resident mail guru, has an idea as to how that 
could happen ?

I don't have a theory myself, but I note that the string "> " is
commonly used as a quote indent. Then again, I don't quite see
how a mailer could have been confused by that and not by
subsequent occurrences of the same string in the Proposal text.

Some food for thought : the rise of the nationalist right in France 
is commonly attributed to an ever larger rate of abstentionism. Then 
again, this might just be one of these things that the other side 
spreads around to get people to vote for them. ;)

I have no better idea than that Blob must have done some careless editing.
The typo is in my copy as well.

I don't think ELM has a sent-mail folder, but if it does, Blob could check
what he actually sent...

It seems pretty clear that the message was sent correctly to Blob?

Protoproposal Chaos33 [rev. 3]

The Industrial Revolution

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Certain entities, or classes of entities, may be designated as
      Possessions by the Rules.

      Every entity which is designated as a Possession has an Owner.
      If no other record exists of the Owner of a given Possession,
      its Owner is the Bank.

      Any entity which possesses any Possession, but which does not
      have an Executor nor is already in Probate, shall be placed in
      Probate.

      The Owner of a Possession may transfer the Ownership of that
      Possession to any other entity capable of owning Plots by
      sending a message to the Officer responsible for maintaining the
      record of Ownership of that Possession.  The message shall
      unambiguously identify the Possession to be transferred and the
      entity who is to receive ownership of that Possession.  The
      change of ownership is effective at the time the message is
      sent, unless the message specifies a later time.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 896 be amended by deleting the
paragraph reading "When a Player registers, eir Location is the
Welcoming Center." 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by replacing
"Moves to the Stasis Chamber" with "announces that e does so in the
Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the Stasis Chamber" with
"announces that e does so in the Public Forum".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended by deleting the
words "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1711 be amended to read,

      A Degree that has been Granted becomes awarded when the
      recipient notifies the Speaker (or eir Delegate, as described
      below) that e accepts the Degree.

      When a Degree is Granted to a recipient who is not a Player, the
      Speaker shall promptly inform the recipient that e has been
      Granted the degree by some means which has a reasonable
      likelihood of reaching the recipient.  The Speaker may Delegate
      this duty to any other willing Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1706, 1707, 1708, and 1709 be
repealed, and further that any and all Locations still remaining in
existence are destroyed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1710 be amended to read,

      There shall exist the Office of Cartographor.  The Cartographor
      shall retain the records of Ownership of Plots and of Factories.

      The Official Report of the Cartographor shall contain:
      * the Location and Ownership of every Plot
      * the Placement and Ownership of every Factory

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Location is an ordered pair of integers.  The first of these
      two integers is the Longitude of that Location, and the second
      is the Latitude.  No Longitude may be less than the Minimum
      Longitude nor greater than the Maximum Longitude.  No Latitude
      may be less than the Minimum Latitude nor greater than the
      Maximum Latitude.  Initially, the Minimum Longitude and Minimum
      Latitude are both 0, and the Maximum Longitude and Maximum
      Latitude are both 10.  Any of these may be changed
      (independently of the others) by the action of any Instrument of
      Power 1 or greater, or by the Cartographor Without Objection,
      but in no case may the Minimum Longitude be greater than the
      Maximum Longitude, nor may the Minimum Latitude be greater than
      the Maximum Latitude.

      For each possible Location (as detailed above) there exists
      exactly one Plot.  Plots are Possessions.

      A Plot may contain Currencies.  For the purposes of the Rules, a
      Plot's Executor is the same as the Executor of its Owner.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Factories are a class of entities which may be placed upon
      Plots.  At most one Factory may be placed upon a Plot, and every
      Factory is placed on at most one Plot.  The Plot upon which a
      Factory is placed is called its Placement.  

      The Owner of a Factory which is not placed upon a Plot may place
      it upon any Plot which does not already contain a Factory.  The
      Owner of a Factory which is placed upon a Plot may remove it
      from that Plot.  The Owner of a Plot may remove any Factory
      placed upon it.  All of these are accomplished by the Owner of
      the Factory (or the Plot, in the third case) by sending a
      message to the Cartographor unambiguously specifying what is to
      be done.

      Factories are Possessions.  

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Each Factory is of a particular Design, and once created as a
      Factory of that Design cannot be changed to a Factory of another
      type.  

      Every Factory consumes and produces units of Currency according
      to its Design.  The Design for each Factory specifies an input
      of a positive number of units of a Currency, and an output of a
      non-negative number of units of a Currency (which need not be
      distinct from that of the input).

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if, in the Plot where a
      Factory is placed, there exist at least as many units of the
      input Currency as called for by that Factory's Design, and that
      Factory is Active, the Factory destroys that many units of the
      input Currency and creates the number of units of the output
      Currency as specified in the Design.  The units of Currency thus
      destroyed are taken from, and the units of Currency thus created
      are added to, the Plot in which the Factory is Placed.

      Any Factory which has, for the entire preceding Nomic Week, been
      Placed in the same Plot, is Active.  All other Factories are
      Idle.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      A Factory with a given Design may only be created by the Mintor
      of the Output Currency called for by that Design. 

      In order to create a Factory, the Mintor of the Output Currency
      called for in that Design must destroy 4 Ergs, specifying that e
      does in a message sent to both the Recordkeepor of Ergs and to
      the Cartographor.  This message must also specify for the
      Cartographor the Design of the Factory thus created.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The following standard Factory Designs exist:

      Mine:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 3 Ergs.
      House:  Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 P-Note.
      Farm:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 VT.
      Church: Input is 1 Erg, output is 0 or more Indulgences, as
      specified elsewhere.

      The Bank may not create any Factory with a Design other than
      those given by this Rule.

      The Bank, upon the request of any entity who also successfully
      transfers 4 Ergs to the Bank for the purpose of making that
      request, shall create a Factory of any of these designs and
      shall transfer ownership of the Factory thus created to the
      entity thus requesting.

Question: why does a Proto with no changes warrant a new revision number?

Either you're using changebars, in which case I can't understand the new
revision number, or you're not using them, in which case I can't tell what
you've changed. Either way, you've confused the heck out of me.

Go ahead. I mainly wrote it up because I wasn't sure at the time whether
anyone else would get around to writing a proto.

True. I accidentally retained some now-inaccurate verbiage from the old
version of the Rule -- I thought I'd fixed all of these, but I wrote this
late at night and I obviously missed a couple.

Personally, I felt that it's not a useful enough idea to keep. True, a few
Rules do make use of it, but they're few enough that I felt better amending
them than trying to keep the concept. My biggest problem with the way
you've handled it in your Proto (and, indeed, the way it's handled now) is
that Delegation is a temporary holding. It makes more sense to me to lump
"normal" and "delegated" officeholding together, since neither of them
requires an Election, and refer to all other situations as "temporary."
That way, an Election is triggered whenever an Office is held temporarily. 
        
>>Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

Taking a look at your Proto, it seems perhaps better written, although the
actual results are basically the same. My Proto doesn't write many of the
concepts into the Delegation rule because they're already covered in the
other Rules: the Delegating Player ceasing to be Electee to the Office
during the PoD is covered by the Filling Vacant Offices Rule, and the
Delegated Player ending the Delegation early is covered by the resignation
rule. I'm not sure whether I like having the Delegated Player keep the
Office or not, actually.

Ah, right. My bad.

Heh. I'll just chime in here to say that I really do think that these
concepts are rendered unneccesary by the existence of Electees. In fact, as
Michael mentions, there are a few situations where using them can actually
muddy the waters, since it ignores the Electee mechanism we're trying to
create. What happens if, for some reason, a Rule states that a player
resumes holding an Office "in the normal fashion" when that player is no
longer Electee? It's easier and more aesthetically pleasing, IMHO, to just
have the player resume holding the Office.
