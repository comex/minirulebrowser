Yes, I suppose you're right. After all, we say 'the concert was cancelled'
without implying that one took place. In fact we imply the opposite.

I think if the Judgement of CFJ 933 is sustained, we'll probably
pass an amnesty Proposal.

Um, didn't you just say in reply to me that what you were interested
in was working out a coherent framework for thinking about events?
That's at least partly a theoretical matter.

Too fast, Michael. If the paradox is the result of the interaction of
provisions each of which, individually, is perfectly clear,
unambiguous and applicable, then R594 will give you no reason at all
not to apply them.

R698 may be silent on the question of the eligibility of non-Players
to serve as judges - but other Rules are not. R951, for instance
says that "the Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select, from
amongst those Players eligible, a Judge to be assigned to Judge that
CFJ". Note 'Players', not 'persons'.

I maintain that Calabresi was ineligible to serve as Judge, and
so is ineligible to serve as Justice.

Far be it from me to discourage discussion, and I think this has already 
started to happen, but maybe it'd be helpful to shift the debate from 
what the situation is under the current Rules to what the ideal framework 
for proposals taking effect would be, and how to get that framework set 
up. Or at least to add that component to the debate. I haven't followed 
it closely enough to really contribute at this point, though, so I'll 
just keep to myself.. In fact, I'm not sure why I'm writing this anymore. 
Maybe I won't send it... nah, what the heck.

Why do you assume that there must be a single defensible answer to
the question 'how many events or mathematical operations are there?'?
 If x=5, and I say 'let x=3x+2', I can reasonable say that this is
one event or operation (x's taking a new value'), or 4 events (3
additions to perform the tripling, and the another addition of 2), or
5 events (3 additions, and 2 successorships), or even 17 events (17
successorships). How many operations you thought there 'really' were
would be completely a matter of what you were interested in.

Is the sentence 'Repeal Rules X, Y and Z' one provision or three?
Good question. I don't think anything I've said so far commits me
to either answer. Intuitively I think of acts of Repeal as single
events, so intuitively I think there are 3 events. Otherwise, we'd
have to say that that the repeal of Rule X was the very same event
as the repeal of Rule Y, and that seems odd.

Does this contradict what I said earlier about sticking to my guns
and insisting, if I had to, that "Every Player gains 10 points." is
really one event, not as many events as there are Players? I think
what I want to do now is point out that I really don't have to
stick to my guns. I had good reasons for allowing the level of
individuation of events to be only approximate. I still maintain
that for most purposes, individuation at the level of provisions
is about right. What we've seen is that there can be reasons to
descend to finer-grained levels. What we haven't seen is that 
there can be reasons to ascend to coarser-grained levels.

I am aware of a latent threat of circularity here, however. If I'm
going to individuate events by provisions, then I can't turn around
and individuate provisions by counting the number of events they
cause. One temptation, to be resisted for the moment, is to try and
break the circle of interdefinition by defining an events as a
change to the game state. but that only leads back around in a circle
as well, since what Michael thinks is one change to the game state,
I might think of as three, appealing to different intuitions.

Of course that isn't an argument, but just a restatement of your

I agree that that the line between counting it as 1 provision, or
2, or even more, is somewhat arbitrary, a line in the sand as you
call it. Some lines are more artistic than others, however.

Speaking of lines in the sand, could you clarify something, Scott? Are 
you using that phrase in its capacity to imply a confrontation, i.e. 
'cross this line and I'll break your nose?' Or does it just represent 
boundaries which can easily be erased, redrawn, etc.? just curious...

I'm as interested in establishing a coherent, consistent and rational
model for the application of Proposals as you are.  Do you doubt
that? I claim that Morendil's Judgement establishes one such model,
although of course not the only possible one.  Let's concede for the
sake of argument that it's purely a matter of taste which model is to
be preferred. You, however, are on record as saying that, as a matter
of principle, disagreements about taste are insufficient grounds for
overturning a Judgement. Did you really mean that when you said it?
Or did you say it merely to brush aside Morendil's objections to your
Appeal Judgement in CFJ 937 in a convenient fashion?

Unless you want your declarations of principle to be exposed as
mere conveniences to be discarded when they prove cumbersome, your
approach to the current sitation should be to support Morendil's
Judgement, and then seek legislative remedy to move to a system
more like the one you prefer.

Since the debate has, briefly, turned to practical matters, I'd like to
suggest such a Proposal ought to extend the grace periods for those

there really is no point now in the absence of VT's.

I think Michael is accurate in challenging your use of "events" in

How interesting! Apparently the possibility of conflicting amendments
is great enough to have been actualized. I have a number of comments.
For reference, here's the history of R1551:

History:
Created by Proposal 2425, Jan. 30 1996
Infected and Amended(1) by Rule 1454, Feb. 4 1997, substantial
  (unattributed)
Amended(2) by Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar. 26 1997, substantial
Null-Amended(3) by Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar. 26 1997,
  cosmetic (unattributed)
Null-Amended(4) by Proposal 3452 (Steve), Apr. 7 1997, cosmetic
  (unattributed)

Firstly, Chuck's treatment of the conflicting amendments counts 
against the atomic view, I think. On the atomic view, the application
of P3445 effected a transformation of R1551, but none of the intermediate
states is supposed to have been in effect long enough to have had any
effect. Yet, evidently, one of the conflicting amendments was held to
have had effect long enough to have resulted in the incrementing of
the the Amendment Number of R1551. Contrary to the atomic view, R1069
must have had a chance to look at the application of P3445 provision
by provision. This is the clearest evidence we have seen so far that
game custom is against the atomic view.

I am, however, puzzled by the other aspects of the History. Why was
the second amendment of R1551 in P3445 held to be a null-amendment? 
It did not use the 'replace text A with text B' construction. Can
you explain your treatment, Chuck?

I take the double increment in the Amendment Number of R1551 as the
result of Proposal 3445 to show that this is not how the system
has worked historically in at least one case. Of course, that has no
effect on its merits as a proposed system we should consider legislating.

I don't understand why the second amendment was a null-amendment.

I wouldn't call it a special duty. Of course the Jstices should examine
the truth or falsity of the Statement, as carefully as is necessary to
make a determination. But it seems here that we may have a case where
the truth or falsity of the statement depends on which model you have
of the way Proposals are applied when they are adopted. If it is really
true that nothing in the Rules or game custom favour one model over the
other, then it's just a matter of taste, and deference is due the Judge.

I should add that I'm quite excited abut the discovery of the double
amendment to R1551 in P3445. To my mind this demonstrates that game
custom is clearly against the atomic view, whatever its other merits.
If intermediate states are purely a calculational convenience, then
the amendment number of R1551 should not have been double incremented.
But it was. So the atomic view is false as a view about how Proposals
have actually been applied.

That sounds like something Suber might have said. After all, that's
basically the central thesis of his book _The Paradox of Self-Amendment_.

It's pleasing to see that a consensus is growing at least concerning
what the alternatives are. But if the adoption of a Proposal is a single
events, the parts of which are invisible to other Rules, then how do
you explain the double increment to R1551's Amendment Number as the
result of the adoption of P3445? On the atomic view, from the point
of view of R1069, the intermediate states required to determine the
effects of P3445 are invisible. So there should have been only one
amendment to R1551, not two.

Sorry! I should have read more closely. It *did* use that construction.

I believe Morendil is referring to a point so far mostly ignored in
the discussion, although it was raised, namely that R1579 is actually
badly worded. It doesn't say "If a Currency ceases to have a Mintor...", it
says "if the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist...". The latter
might be held to be true even if the Currency in question gained a new
Mintor at the same time.

Personally, I wouldn't want to put too much weight on that point. I
prefer to think, and have been arguing as though, the latter is 
equivalent to the former.

The Way of Agora is always to do what you are required to do. But if
no-one is required to Report the Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness,
what the Agoran Way dictates may not be so clear. If the Rules give us
some latitude in dealing with events, why shouldn't we make use of it?

Hofstadter has published a book since _Fluid Concepts and Creative

Does anyone really think, even at 3:10am, that the current state of the
game is logically deducible even in principle from the initial state
of the game?

And the problem that Judgements are not logical deductions.

Well, probably someone does, knowing this game, but that's not what Orjan 
said, exactly. He also included the 'history of relevant real-world 
events,' which, luckily for the believability factor of the concept, 
isn't derived from some embryonic state, but is just the set of all 
things which have affected the Ruleset and Game State. In which case, it 
seems pretty acceptable, unless you are one for the idea that quantum 
indeterminism, etc. ruins the deterministic picture of the universe.

I personally like to think of Agora as a necessary, if somewhat delayed, 
consequence of the amount of energy present in the Big Bang together with 
the physical laws which govern the universe. :)

You're missing the part about 'relevant real-world events,' Steve -- 
Judgements certainly fall into that category.

It's called _Le Ton beau de Marot_, and from what I've read so far it's 
about translation, and all its joys and sorrows. It seems really 
interesting; again, I've only read a few pages, and I don't think I'll 
have time to read much more for a while. From the introduction: "I will 
admit that I have been running on a strong inner hunch that this is 
probably the best book I will ever write....I had pretty much forgotten 
the exuberance that one can derive from working on a tightly integrated 
artistic structure as large as this book is, because the last time I did 
anything really similar was around twenty years ago, when I was writing 
_Godel, Escher, Bach_."

If he's that excited, so am I. I have some other books on translation I'd 
really like to read also; who do these professors think they are, anyway, 
assigning Thucydides and Herodotus when there's Hofstadter to be had? 
(Just kidding, all you professors out there... :)

Let s be the state of the game on March 26, 1997, just before the 
adoption of P3445, in particular that part of it including Rule
1551/1. Let f and g be the R1551-amending provisions in P3445. Let R
be R1069. Your contention must be then that the game state evolved
directly from s to g.f(s). The game state never had the value f(s),
which we can describe as the state of the game in which the Amendment
Number of R1551 is 2, after the first amendment to R1551 has been
applied, but before the second amendment to R1551 has been applied:
that state is a mere calculational convenience, invisible to R1069.
But then you cannot explain how the Amendment Number of R1551 reached
3 as the result of the adoption of P3445. As far as the states
visible to R1069 are concerned, R1551 was amended only once. But in
fact, the Amendment Number was doubly incremented. We must conclude,
therefore, that state of the game did have the value f(s) as more than
a matter of calculational convenience, long enough for R1069 to fire.
Atomicity is false as a historical view.

Our hypotheses should be as simple as is necessary to account for
the data, and no simpler. The Rules, in at least the one case
described above, (and who knows, there may be more), recognise the
existence of intermediate states, and so endorse my selection of
provisions as the approximately correct level at which to individuate
events.

"Clear as a bell" is the one that comes to mind.  Which is interesting, 
because it's a completely different metaphor -- "clear as mud" and "crystal 
clear" are literally referring to transparency, but "clear as a bell" 
literally refers to sound.  Idioms are strange!

The Americanism for extremely clear is "crystal clear", I think.
There may be others.

This only means that among Players, only those who are eligible to

I don't think the double increment of Rule 1551's Amendment Number is
necessarily indicative of anything.

Amendment Numbers are epiphenomenal.  No Rule ever mandates
"incrementing the Amendment Number".  I argue that the change in the
Amendment Number is not a "collateral effect" but merely an
epiphenomenological consequence of an amendment.

The second amendment is quoted below.  You are not reading very
closely, Steve, if you don't see multiple instances of "replace text A
with text B" in what follows.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be retitled "Documents Subject
| to Ratification" and amended as follows:
| 
|    a) In the first paragraph, replace "to be valid for the purpose of
|       a Vote of Confidence (VOC) Directive" with "to be subject to
|       ratification";
|    b) in the first paragraph, replace "the VOC Directive"
|       with "the Proposal which seeks to ratify it";
|    c) in the first element "vi", replace "all VOC Directives" with
|       "ratification";
|    d) replace the entire paragraph beginning "Further, a Document",
|       with "Further, a Document is not subject to being ratified if
|       any of the following occur during the Voting Period of a
|       Proposal which seeks to ratify it:"; and
|    e) in the second element "i", and the second element "ii", and the
|       final paragraph of the Rule, replace "the VOC Directive's Voting
|       Period" with "the Voting Period of the Proposal which seeks to
|       ratify it".
| 
| For the purposes of the interpretation of the above amendment, an
| "element" is a paragraph of a Rule which begins with a lowercase roman
| numeral followed by a right parenthesis.

I don't believe that the paradigm that Michael or myself is advocating
requires that only one of two amendments to the same Rule occurs.  I
see no problem with a Rule being amended twice by the same Proposal.

You are clearly confused as to the operation of Rule 1069, however,
and I think your entire argument falls apart under a proper reading of
Rule 1069.

The problem with your argument (made now so many times that it is
getting boring) Rule 1069 does not "fire" when a Rule is amended.
Rule 1069 tells us that the Amendment Number of a Rule is the number
of times it has been amended.  Rule 1551 was amended twice by Proposal
3445; therefore, Rule 1551's Amendment Number was two greater than it
was prior to Proposal 3445 _solely_ because Rule 1551 had been amended
two more times afterwards than before.  Rule 1069 merely tells us how
to compute the Amendment Number.  For Rule 1069 to do what you claim
it does, it would have to say "A Rule's Amendment Number is
incremented each time that Rule is Amended."  Rule 1069 does not say
this, however.

Rule 1069 "fires" every time someone wishes to determine the Amendment
Number of a Rule, and when the Rulekeepor prepares an Official copy of
the Ruleset.  

I sense a problem with Rule 1069, actually, but I'll have to think
about it more.  The first paragraph seems in conflict with itself.

Bells are said to be "clear" or "muddy", depending on how close the
harmonics are to ideal.  (There are other terms that are also used.)
A good bell is clear, in that it has no dissonant harmonics.  A muddy
bell has dissonant harmonics (and is unlikely to be used for any

There was an intermediate state where the rule had been amended once.  The
second amendment was then applied onto that.  R1551 doesn't set any precedent.

You go directly from s to g.f(s) as far as the rules are concerned, but
R1551 *is* actually amended twice.

The game state f(s) contains Rule 1551/2.  Game state g.f(s) contains Rule
1551/3.  Therefore, the game state never saw a 1551/2, but we as Players
did, and the remnants of it are rightly in the ruleset.  When the first
provision amended R1551/1, it made it into R1551/2 and added "Amended(2) by
Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar. 26 1997, substantial" to the History of
that rule, as it was in state f(s).  The second provision made R1551/2 into
R1551/3 and added "Null-Amended(3) by Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar.
26 1997, cosmetic (unattributed)" to the History of that rule, as it was in
state g.f(s).  Therefore, the final outcome was that R1551/1 was amended
twice and became R1551/3.

That case was obviously not dealt with atomically. As I hope I have made
clear, that tells us nothing about how some other proposal must be
treated.

Notaproposal V1

Eliminate Game Custom

Let Rule 217 be amended by removing the phrase "game custom" and replacing
the text "past Judgments" with "past Judgments (and any Injunctions
resulting therefrom)". In addition, let the Annotation of this Rule be
removed.

Let Rule 1365 be amended by replacing the phrase "past Judgments, and Game
Custom" with "past Judgments (and any Injunctions resulting therefrom)"


-------------------------------------------

Before anybody objects, can you tell me why consideration of the Rules,
past Judgments, and the best interests of the game are not sufficient?
Game Custom has been disregarded before when inconvenient. If, in a
particular situation, following Game Custom is particularly wise, why,
then you have just identified the "best interests of the game"

Alrighty!!!  You're so correct it hurts :)  Keeping the "Game Custom"
phrase in there also hurts newbies, who have no clue what game custom is...

Newbie: I think it should be interpreted this way.
Player: You're wrong!  Game Custom says that it's interpreted this way.
You have no argument.

Sorry, I tend to be cryptic the later it gets. I'm not reading them in 
Greek; although I might take Greek next semester, 'agora' is about all I 
know right now. :) I'm reading them for my History 211 class, 'European 
History from Antiquity to 1700.' And a great class it is too, so far 
anyway. Sorry for a possible incorrect semicolon usage, or at least a 
misleading one. Those books have nothing to do with translation, at least 
not for me.

In the case that you wanted changes to take effect sequentially.

You raise a valid point in reminding us that the change in VT
Mintor was not a direct effect of 3533, but rather an indirect
effect; but I reject your Prinicple of Ordering with respect
to Rule-mandated GS Changes.  Recall my judgement, recently reposted,
that several currency transfers could take place simultaneously.
(Although granted, that was before PC and also involved only
multiple transfers mandated by a single Rule.)

I got about 2/3 of the way through it, but then another library

How does the command to select from all eligible Players imply
that all non-Players are ineligible?  (Note: "ineligible", not
"unable to be selected.")

I would instead argue that non-Players do not have the Boolean
Nomic Property of Ineligibility to Judge CFJ NNN.

Actually, I would be in favor of getting rid of  "the best interests
of the game."  There is some merit, I believe, in what
Ronald Kunne said, recently reposted here--that the rule in
evaluating the success of various attempted Scams (and crises)
is "don't make waves so high the boat capsizes."  True, this was
even before "the best interests of the game" was incorporated
into 217, but that phrase only reinforces that.  Let us not
be so afriad of crashing Agora!  Crashing a nomic is an Interesting
Thing, and we should not so broadly prohibit it.

Says who?  594 goes on to say

     In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each provision is
     severable from the others, unless the Proposal states otherwise.

and I contend that a Proposal with provisions like

     1) The Glork becomes Red iff Provision 2 is implemented
     2) The Glork becomes Red iff Provision 1 is not implemented

cause "unless the Proposal states otherwise" to fire.  Those provisions
are not severable from each other, and 594 takes 'em down in a group.

Have you minted any Voting Tokens yet?

It would seem that if VTs were really destroyed, then solving the Crisis
depends on getting new ones minted and distributed as Salaries. There is
no reason not to start with this immediately, just in case.

All I have to do is mint a bunch and satisfy the numerous unpaid POs
that would exist.  I prefer to wait until the situation is resolved,
rather than creating a state split that would at least double my
paperwork during the pendency of the litigation.

Um, right, I didn't think of the fact that the POs would stay around until
properly satisfied.

It is precisely the crux of the atomic that there was no such
intermediate state.

The atomic is partly a historical view about Proposals are actually
applied. As such, the existence of a counterexample shows that it
is false.

You're probably right. But that doesn't rule out the possibility
of a bunch of *severable* provisions which are individually clear,
and which together lead to paradox. R594 won't rule them inapplicable.

Then you have not properly considered the consequences of your
own view. The atomic view commits you to the view that Proposals are
to be viewed as single functions equivalent to a composition of
subfunctions, with none of the intermediate states visible to the
Rules. It follows that no Proposal can amend a Rule more than once,
as far as the Rules are concerned.  

Consider a Rule R with text A, and a Proposal containing two
amendments to it, which we can call the functions f and g. Let
f(A)=B, and g.f(A)=C.  On the atomic view, the text of Rule R is
instantaneously transformed from A to C; R never has the text B
except as a calculational convenience. On the atomic view, then,
there cannot be held to have been two amendments for any purpose
which matters for the Rules, and in particular not for the purposes
of R1069, which, I am perfectly well aware, counts "the number of
times a Rule...has been amended."

Such as the following?

Provision 1 - repeal all Rules pertaining to Rule precedence/deferral
Provision 2 - enact the following Rule:
  Whenever two Rules are in conflict, the lower-numbered Rule wins.
Provision 3 - enact the following Rule:
  Whenever two Rules are in conflict, the higher-numbered Rule wins.

Scott, come on. While it seems reasonable enough to me for Harlequin's 
message to be interpreted as two TOs, I won't argue with your prerogative 
to make that determination yourself. But is it really necessary to 
transfer Honour away from Morendil for opening a debate on the subject? 
It's not as though his statement was couched in hostile terms; certainly 
we all believe some actions of others in the context of the game to be 
'ridiculous.' And for gosh sakes, it's just a COE; it's not as though he 
jumped in with a CFJ on the matter.

The problem with your reply is that it is not available to you to
say that R1551 was amended twice by P3445. An amendment is a
function taking the text of a Rule as input and producing a new
text as output. The atomic view commits you to saying that a
Proposal containing two provisions which claim to be amendments
to the same Rule results in only one amendment, since on the
atomic view, there's really only one function, that described
by the Proposal.

Sounds to me as though what you're saying is that it is not impossible
for it to be in the best interests of the game to crash the game.

Actually, the provisions don't themselves add anything to the Histories;
they just create requirements that the Rulekeepor later fulfils. But
that's by the by.

The real problem here for the atomic view is that R1069 counts the
number of amendments. An amendment is the transformation of the text
of a Rule. Counting the number of amendments means counting the number
of transformations. If a single Proposal amends the text of a Rule
from A to B to C, then the atomic view has to see this as just one
transformation, from A to C. The transformations from A to B and from
B to C are mere calculational conveniences and are not to be given any
legal reality. But this is not how we have been interpreting R1069.

I agree that on the atomic view it should not fire. On the atomic
view, there's just a single transformation of the X factor here.

It's worthwhile to consider an analogy to R1069 in this case. R1069
counts the number of amendments; an analogous Rule would count the
number of transformations of the X factor. As I've just agreed,
the number of transformations of the X factor, on the atomic view,
is properly seen to be 1. Likewise, the number of transformations of
the text of R1551 made by P3445 must also, according to the atomic
view, be 1. But the real R1069 counts them as two amendments.

I don't necessarily agree with Michael's "functional"
conceptualization, nor do I believe that his conceptualization is the
only possible conceptualization that admits atomicity.

I consider an amendment to be a modification of a Rule.  This
"function" stuff is for the mathematicians.

As far as I'm concerned, an amendment changes the Rule which it
amends.  This stuff about functions is highly amusing, but I pay it
minimal heed.  It's my position that intermediate states are not
visible because they are too fleeting in duration, not because they
are "mere calculational conveniences".  If this is inconsistent with
Michael's exposition, then it's inconsistent with Michael's
exposition.

This creates an interesting situation, particularly if Scott decides
you were correct after all and retracts his denial of your COE within
72 hours.

R1431 states in part:

      A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim commits the
      Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime, unless e then
      admits the Claim within 72 hours after the incorrect denial.

Presumably, if Scott retracts within 72 hours, then he cannot be guilty
of Wrongful COE Denial. But the CFJ would have to go ahead anyway,
and I suppose the Judge would have to Judge FALSE.

It would be especially strange if Scott retracted, and then the Courts
turned around and vindicated his original decision to deny. Is there
a Crime or Infraction of Incorrect Retraction? I don't think so.

I've provided a detailed argument explaining the claim. I provide it
again below.

OK, fair enough. The mathematical terminology is not essential to
the argument; it just aids concision of expression. I'm perfectly
happy to restate the argument without it.

I agree that an amendment is a modification of a Rule. R1069 counts
the number of amendments, so it counts the number of modifications.
So, how many modifications did P3445 make to R1551? Or, more generally,
how many modifications does a Proposal with 2 provisions which amend
the same Rule make to that Rule? Let's imagine a Rule R with text A,
and a Proposal with two provisions: the first of which amends the
text of R from A to B, and the second of which amends the text of R
from B to C. 

What does the atomic view say about this situation? Well, it's your view,
so let me quote back to you your own words of 3 days ago:

      Again, the issue is not whether provisions are applied in some
      sequence, but whether the intermediate states that arise as
      they are applied are exposed.  I am of the belief that these
      intermediate steps are too fleeting to have impact.  Their
      existence is too transient to have legal significance, in my
      opinion.  I feel that Rules like Rule 1579 should be
      interpreted to apply to conditions which persist for some
      tangible period of time, and not to those which hold only for a
      fleeting instant.

In your own words, then, the modifications from A to B and from B to C
are "too fleeting to have impact" and are "too transient to have legal
significance". R1069 therefore cannot count them. The only
modification which R1069 can count is that from A to C. (This is precisely
analogous to your insistence that the only modification to the status
of VTs that counts is that they had a Mintor before and after the
adoption of P3533.) That is, according to the atomic view, R1069 can
count only one amendment as having occurred. But in fact we counted
two amendments as having occurred. The atomic view is therefore false as
a historical view of how Proposals have been applied.

Which means precisely zip unless and until you produce an alternative
conceptualization which is demonstrably different in content. 
Personally, I regard Michael's terminology as a completely neutral
aid to concision of expression, occurring no extra commitments.

It would indeed; however, something tells me that Scott is unlikely to

It's not inconsistent with Michael's exposition. It's exactly equivalent
to it.

If a Proposal amends the same Rule twice, then the intermediate state
in question is one where the first but not the second amendment has
been applied. You cannot claim on the one hand than an amendment changes
the Rule which it amends, *and* that intermediate states are too fleeting
in duration to be counted as siginificant by other Rules, *and* that
R1069 counts two amendments in the case described. That is a flat out
contradiction.
