I believe the line you're looking for is "Strike that - reverse it".

BUS: COE on latest Herald's Report

Michael wrote:

>You have my Kudo rating increasing to 25 without due cause.

Technically, Michael is correct and I admit this claim.  However, the error is
in the statement of Old Status, not in the New Status.  There should be no
increase, but Michael does have 25 Kudos.  Here is the relevant bit from the
prior week's Report.  A corrected new report is appended below.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Why should you elect me Mad Scientist?

I've been inside the Monster's head. I know how it thinks, dammit. You
don't *know* what it's like. You can *never* know what it's like. Oh, the
pain. Only *I* have the knowledge to keep the Monster under control!

Re: Will the real Nomic Entities please stand up?

Actually, after a close look at R1586, even if it is admitted that the
Frankenstein Rule caused most Nomic Entities to cease to be Nomic Entities, the
last paragraph of R1586 would still apply:

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

The Rules still define the Entities in question, it would just change one of
their properties, i.e. their property of being *Nomic* Entities.  Oh well, not
much of a crisis.  8)

Ah, but the Monster has changed so much since you were the monster,
you can't possibly know what it's like now, either.

I would simply like to note my prior experience as Mad Scientist.
I also pledge to follow the prescriptions, as nearly as possible,
in "The Evil Overlord List" which can be found at

IMHO being a Nomic Entity is not a property of an Entity, any more than
existence is a property.

BTW, I should be elected Mad Scientist, obviously - I am obviously
lucky enough to be drawing all the interesting Rules for Mutation. ;)

Yes e can. I think. If anyone can know what's inside the Monster's head. Does 
the Monster even *have* a head? I certainly can't remember putting one on.

As a former Mad Scientist myself, I endorse Harlequin's bid for the office. 
Also, I would like all the candidates to give their best Mad Scientist Maniacal 
Laugh, for comparison purposes.

Hmmm... somehow I doubt any of those will come into play. Also, the list missed 
one: "I will not pause to savor my triumph before revealing the masked hero's 
secret identity." (well, I think it should be on there.)

Also, as High Priest of the Order of the Evil Eye, he has the required Evil 
Genius, and as you can see above, he also has a very good Maniacal Laugh. You 
know, those two things should be required for the Mad Scientist:

The Mad Scientist must have Evil Genius and a Maniacal Laugh. If a CFJ finds 
that the current Mad Scientist lacks one or both of these, and is not 
successfully appealed within the allowed time, the current Mad Scientist is 
immediately removed from office.

Anyone like the idea? :-)

Um, you didn't read very closely then, did you?  It specifically
ruled out maniacal laughter, in that it may distract one from
significant, but obvious threats which would be easily countered
if one were not laughing maniacally.  If elected Mad Scientist,
I will certainly endeavour to do things which would be worthy
of maniacal laughter, but will spend my time thinking of additional
Mad things to do rather than laughing maniacally about what
I've already done.

As alluded to by the Evil Overlord List, many mad scientists have
found maniacal laughter to be their downfall.

This is true in the metanomical sense that anything which only has existance 
because of nomic rules is a nomic entity.  However, in the sense of what the

the rules assign to certian entities.  In other words, Kudos are still nomic

Not really. Being On Hold, he is absolved by R1584 of any responsibilities
the Rules might otherwise impose on him. But he is not required to do anything
in this case.

The problem, if there is one, is that since it's unlikely he'll decline,
he'll remain the Wizard in name, while being absolved of his Wizardly duties.

There's a simple solution to this problem, however: Make the Wizard
an Office.

The Proposal to Make the Wizard an Office has a provision which
will attempt to make Zefram the temporary holder of the Office,
but R1584 (Power=2, note) will block this. Our august Speaker,
General Chaos, will then become the temporary holder of the 
Office of Wizard while an Election is held.

I should note that I don't believe this to be the case.  I am not in
the least convinced that Rule 1671's definition about Nomic Entities
in any way overrides Rule 1586's; at most, what it does is make
anything which satisfies either requirement a Nomic Entity.

There seems to be a problem with the text of R478/9 in the SLR just
published:

Rule 478/9 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      annoucing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that

Is this the result of a bad amendment, or the misapplication
of a good one?

And *you,* dear sir, have obviously spent so much time criticizing the work
and methods of other Mad Scientists that you have forgotten to do some Mad
Science of your own. Through my latest invention, the Mad Scientist
Multitasker (TM), I can laugh maniacally, create bizarre inventions, *and*

to write this message, I have already invented three new inventions!

Rule 1623/7 (Power=1)
Disinterested Proposals

      A Proposal is Disinterested if its Petition fee has not been
      paid to the Bank by the time it is distributed.  If a Proposal
      is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

I know Morendil tried to pay the Petition Fee for P3530. But did he do
it before the Proposal was distributed? If not, then my Report of 
Currency changes due to P3530 was incorrect, since the Proposal was
Disinterested and had no Payor.

The proposal was distributed at Fri, 27 Jun 1997 22:27:49 +0200.

Also note that Andre mentions in the message in which e distributed
3527-3530 that Morendil paid the Petition Fee for 3530.
