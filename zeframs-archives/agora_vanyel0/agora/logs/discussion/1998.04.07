I was going to quote the first paragraph of R786, but perhaps you're
right, and R786 does not say who holds the Office of Speaker-Elect
before the Speaker makes the announcement. R1006 does, of course: it
says that the Speaker holds vacant Offices. On the other hand R1647,
states that "the Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect,
even temporarily", and that it "takes precedence over all other Rules
defining the characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect."
Probably, R1006 is such a Rule, so it is indeed, as you suggested,
impossible to determine who the Speaker-Elect is - we only know that
it isn't the Speaker. 

This leaves us with a familiar dilemma. R1006 defines an Office as
a position held by a Player. So: either during the period before the
Speaker's announcement, the position of Speaker-Elect ceases to be
an Office (!), or we say that it is being held by some Player, even
though we have no way even in principle of determining who it is.
I believe there's Judicial precedence that it's the former of these
possibilities that actually holds. Is that right?

I don't remember any particular judicial precedent, but it's possible
that there is one of course.  I think I prefer the second alternative
you mention above, that of indeterminacy.  

Harlequin, won't you reform the S-E rules along with the rest of the
Electees proposal?

Michael.

Really?  The deadline was on Saturday, and I don't remember seeing
anything from you.  There is the different CFJ 1089, but you have
until Thursday on that one.

Very nice.  I think I will retract the report of Infraction in your

You'd better send that to me again then, because I did not receive it.
I keep copies of all the mail I receive and that message was not one
that I got.  Alternatively, because I did not receive it, your e-mail
did not constitute submission to me, and I'm not required to publish
it.  

Michael.

That's pretty silly.  Why should I still be ineligible to judge this
just because I was on Hold a few weeks ago?  Can someone point me
towards the rule that specifies this?

It's Rule 911 (clause (iv) in particular) and I agree it's silly.

It would seem so.  But hey, if you're leaving the game; you probably

I disagree.  Commonsense says you want people to see a proposal before they
vote on it, but it is not a necessary precondition at all.  I do not see a
direct conflict here, either.

Maybe, but I'm not sure it is that clearcut.  The Rules don't really give a
*procedure* for putting a Proposal in the queue, they just specify a minimum
time within which it must be done.  But I suppose it is reasonable to interpret
this as a procedure which only allows a proposal to be placed in the queue
once.

Yes, that was the idea. I wasn't aware of 1802 at the time. All I
remembered about vacated stuff was that the score penalties for the
tardiness blots I had reported stayed even after I vacated the blots.

I agree. I am not sure what the "effect" referred to in 1802 is: just
the transfer of currency; or fulfilling the purpose the TO was
for. And in the present case: was the purpose to trigger a score
change order from the herald, or was it the completion of the score
change by the scorekeepor? 

The score change was ordered legally. Now that the TOs have been
vacated, are we saying that in retrospect the Herald was not really
empowered to order these changes, so they are not valid? How could e
have known, or in other words, at which time does 1782 check whether
the player issuing a score change is empowered to do so (reminds me of
the problems with the time when the eligibility to judge is
determined)? 

Of course, I wouldn't terribly mind if I didn't receive the score
gain. I deliberately tried this with something that doesn't matter
much or, at least, doesn't create any bothersome game state splits and
stuff. But I think the more practical solution would be not to
backtrack all effects triggered by the execution of a TO, and prohibit
vacating TOs.

Hasn't someone mentioned that they are working on this? Or should I
propose something?

That's more than a little weird - I sent that mail in the same batch
as my decision in 1089, which you did say you had received ? Both are
sitting snugly side by side in my sent mail archive and I'd imagined
they'd be doing the same in your inbox. ;) I've forwarded it in to
you in a separate enclosure.

I didn't receive anything from you on Saturday at all.  My comment
about 1089 was in response to your suggestion that you'd just missed
the deadline by a couple of hours.  I didn't understand what you meant
at all, but I figured it couldn't be in relation to 1090 because that
had its deadline go ages ago. 

Michael.

I've been trying to get back to the point of having time to make some
proposals.  I wanted to include the repeal of 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers) and
add a provision to 1598 to make TOs invalid that purport to satisfy
unsatisfiable POs, thereby obviating the need for 1754 (the only case, IMO,
where a Player deserves an automatic "refund").  But if you can get something
ready ahead of me, go for it.

I see - well, I have forwarded a copy of my decision in 1089 as well. 
Let me know if you still don't receive them !

Proto:  Indelible Transfer Orders

Amend Rule 1799 by replacing the text:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.

with the text:

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended, stayed,
      or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders,
      Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer Order may be
      amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who executed it only
      during the time in which it is delayed.

Repeal Rule 1754.

Amend Rule 1598 by appending the sentence:

      If a Transfer Order purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order
      and either that Payment Order does not exist or cannot be
      satisfied by the Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is
      invalid.

[Avoid the problem of tracking down the effects of a Transfer Order once it has
been fully executed.  Get rid of the Inadvertent transfer loophole and prevent
transfers from occuring at all if they are supposed to satisfy a PO but cannot
or do not do so.  Should I require the Recordkeepor to report this if it
happens?  I notice that the Omnibus reform removed the requirement for
Recordkeepors to report a TO failure due to lack of funds.]

Sigh. I hadn't realised that Justices could not Judge late. 

I've mostly finished a long discussion of the issues raised by CFJ 1090.
I'll post it today so that the future Justices can look at it.

The quoted Rule does not support his argument.  It says "to reach a 
determination that either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by 
that Board AND SUBMIT IT TO THE COTC" (emphasis mine).  Just making up his 
mind isn't sufficient.  If the determination isn't submitted to the CotC 
within the seven days, it triggers the "failure to do so" clause.

Alright, let's go along with that for the sake of argument. Then just
as R2 does not conflict with R1 unless R3 is in play, equally, R3
doesn't conflict with R1 unless R2 is in play. If all three Rules are
in play, then it would seem that both R3 and R2 are in conflict with
R1, each in virtue of the presence of the other.

How should these conflicts be resolved? It's a tricky question, but
as a Judge I'd be tempted to draw the conclusion that R3 and R2
implicitly conflict with each other, since they cannot both be
effective in the presence of R1, and treat them accordingly. Going by
Number, R2 would take precedence and be effective, while R3 would not
be. Of course, that's just an artifact of the arbitrary order in
which the Rules appear in the example - but lots of precedence
resolution is arbitrary.

In response to Michael, here's a repost of CFJ 875, which I think
is relevant to our current discussion concerning the identity of
the Speaker-Elect. Although the Statement refers to a slightly
different case in which a new Rule defining an Office is created,
the remarks of the Justices are, I think, applicable to current
case.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
The original judgement of CFJ 875 has been reversed, and the decision
on this statement is now TRUE.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 875

"Rule 1006 should be interpreted to mean that if a Rule is enacted
 which designates a position to be an Office, and no procedure exists
 to determine which Player initially holds that Office, then such a 
 position is not an Office, unless such a Rule takes precedence over 
 Rule 1006."

  Majority of Justices agree that judgement was incorrect, and that
  its decision is to be reversed.  There ends CFJ 875.

======================================================================

Justice Chuck's decision:

In the matter of Judge Zefram's Judgement of FALSE on CFJ 875, I find
that this Judgement is in error, and that the Judgement should be
reversed to TRUE.

I agree with the Judge that in such a case as described by the
Statement, there are two possible resolutions: that an indeterminate
Player holds the Office, or that the putative Office is not an Office
after all.

Zefram gives two reasons for selecting the first resolution.  He cites
Game Custom, noting that we have had indeterminate game states before.
However, I believe he is confusing two different types of
indeterminacy.  We have often had instances where we have been unsure
of the game state, but in all of these, it has been possible, at least
in principle, to determine the actual game state.  To choose Zefram's
solution would be to have a game state that is indeterminate even in
theory; I know of no such cases where this has happened before, so
this interpretation does not have the support of Game Custom.

Judge Zefram also points out that the former interpretation satisfies
both Rules in question, while the latter violates the Rule defining
the Office.  At one time, I would have agreed with Zefram.  At one
time, I *did* agree with Zefram.  As it was long ago, I cannot cite
the CFJ, nor do I remember the particulars, but the status of a Group
was in question.  As Judge, I ruled that the Group no longer existed
on the same basis as Zefram ruled here, that the Group's ceasing to
exist prevented a Rule conflict--despite the fact that no Rule
explicitly mandated the dissolution of the Group.  However, my
Judgement was found to be in error by the Appeals Court--the mere fact
that the resolution satisfied all Rules in question did not justify
creating that resolution out of thin air, with no other support from
the Rules.  This is exactly what Zefram has done here.  In as much as
past Judgements are to be considered in Judging CFJs, I find that the
Appellate Judgement in that case clearly refutes the "indeterminate
Player" interpretation here.  Thus, the only interpretation supported
is that the putative Office is not actually an Office, and the
Statement is TRUE.

======================================================================

Justice Andre's decision:

Judgement: REJUDGE

The Appelants have a good case in claiming Rule 1011 might disallow
the change of holding of an Office to an unknown Player. Because this
could be seen as bringing new evidence into the case, which might
indeed be a case for overturning, I think the correct thing for me to
do is setting the Judgement aside and selecting a new Judge.

======================================================================

Justice favor's decision:

Judgement on Appeal of CFJ 875: I overturn the matter which is being
considered.  (Rule 1447/4's worded a little funny, ain't it?)  That
is, I find that the statement is TRUE (or, more to the point and as
required by 451/1, *was* TRUE at the time it was issued).  The
argument per se is relatively simple: Rule 1006/5 includes being held
by a Player as part of the definition of an Office, and Rule 1011
forbids us from changing a Nomic property without a procedure
specified by the Rules.  A Rule which specified an Office, but did not
give us a procedure for someone coming to hold it, would require us to
violate either 1011 or 1006, and therefore unless it took precedence
over both of them (and in particular over 1006), it would fail to have
effect.  So the Statement is TRUE.  I feel, though, that I should deal
with some of the side-arguments that have occurred on this topic:

  - Judge Zefram did not err in suggesting that the state of the Game
    might be indeterminate; this Judgement is silent on whether or not
    that is possible.  But even an indeterminate Game state in which
    someone (someone we know not whom) held an Office, but came to
    hold it without benefit of a procedure blessed by the Rules, would
    violate 1011.

  - There are questions of just how much of a "procedure" Rule 1011
    really demands.  Prior Judgements teach us that the null
    procedure, a simple ad hoc adjustment of the Gamestate to bring it
    into line with conflicting Rules, is *not* permitted.  That is,
    nowhere do the Rules grant us license to fiddle with the Gamestate
    as we wish in order to cure conflicts between Rules.  (Of course,
    we may sometimes have no other choice, but this is not one of
    those times.)

  - If Rule 1006/5 had not mentioned in its very first, definitive,
    sentence that an Office is a thing that is held by a Player, it
    would have been correct to see 1011 as merely overriding the
    second sentence of 1006/5 in this case, resulting in an Office
    that was held by no one.  But given that being held is an
    essential property of an Office, we cannot use 1011 to reach that
    deeply into the guts of 1006/5 and make adjustments to the essense
    of its function (again, we cannot just fiddle with things to try
    to get them to work).

  - Given what is apparently a threefold conflict between 1006/5,
    1011, and a hypothetical procedureless Rule defining an Office,
    where the latter does not win a precedence battle with 1006/5, it
    seems comfortable to allow the latter to be the loser, resulting
    in the entity in question not being an Office.  I will not ask
    what it might be instead, and I will avoid the issue of whether
    the Entity in question exists at all!

Note, of course, that 1006/6 fixes this problem, and there is now
always a procedure for determining who holds an Office...


======================================================================
(Original) Judgment: FALSE

Reasoning:

The first paragraph of Rule 1006/5 defines the term "Office".  It
states "An Office is a position ... established by the Rules and held
by a Player".  The second sentence, "At any time, for each Office there
shall be exactly one Officer who holds it", merely clarifies the latter
clause of the definition.

In the circumstances described in the Statement, another Rule (which
defers to Rule 1006) designates some position as an Office, but there
is no way to determine who holds that Office.  There are two ways to
interpret this situation.  Firstly, the position may be an Office, held
by some Player whose identity cannot be determined.  Secondly, the
position may not be an Office, because no Player holds it.

The first interpretation allows for both Rules to be correct, without
conflict.  The lesser Rule establishes an Office, and 1006/5 states
that it is held by exactly one Player.  However, the identity of that
Officer is indeterminate.  Note that there is precedent for the game
state to be actually indeterminate.

The second interpretation requires the reasoning that, because the
identity of the Officer is indeterminate, there is no such Officer.
This is logic of extremely dubious value.  From this interpretation of
the situation comes a conflict between the two Rules -- the lesser Rule
stating that the position in question is an Office, and Rule 1006/5
implying by definition that it is not.

I believe that the first interpretation is to be preferred, for two
reasons.  First, it avoids a conflict between Rules.  Second, it is
consistent with game custom, which holds that the actual game state is
independent of our perceptions of it.  I therefore Judge this CFJ
FALSE.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1006/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.  At any time, for each Office there shall be exactly
      one Officer who holds it.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Relevant Rules : 1006, 1631

Basically, I agree with Steve that Rule 1006 defines an Office as a
position designated by such by the Rules and which is held by exactly
one Player.

Consequently, if another Rule states that a position which is held by
no Player is an Office, that Rule is in conflict with 1006 and such a
provision cannot apply unless such a Rule wins that conflict.

So no two rules in the example are in direct conflict with any other, but each
is in conflict with the other two taken together.  With this I would agree.

This seems to me to be a disguised way of making it a conflict resolution
between one Rule and multiple other Rules.  I'm not sure our Ruleset supports
such an interpretation for precedence relationships and conflict resolution,
but I'll need to read and reflect on that.  If this is a valid interpretation,
however, it means that one is never safe in just looking for conflicts between
individual Rules, one must also take into account all other Rules of higher
precedence than the two Rules in question.  There may be some subtle conflicts
lurking in the Rules that no one has noticed.  Hey, maybe we can get another
crisis out of this.  8)

I'm not sure I follow you. I don't quite see why the interpretation
I've offered requires any change in our practices. In the general case
of a conflict between Rules A and B, one *already* has to make sure
that no higher precedence Rules have anything to say about the situation
concerning which the Rules are in conflict.

Were we supposed to take that as an actual retraction, or only as a
statement of intent to retract? As outlined in my previous post,
I strongly disagree that your original Report of Infraction was
in error as Morendil claims, and I intend to hold you to it if I can.

Nonsense. R1447 clearly requires you both to reach a determination
and to submit it to the CotC within 7 days. Failure to do both of
these things is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an Appeal. See
below.

If Michael decides to let you off the hook, I'll be contesting that
decision as illegal.
