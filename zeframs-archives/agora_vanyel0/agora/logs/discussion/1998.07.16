Frankly, I probably wouldn't even bother to spend a VT to vote
AGAINST since I'm reasonably sure it would fail quorum. Then again, I
might be wrong and it might pass; that's what voting is all about. It
would probably make a nice experiment.

 IMHO, the fact that it's become so hard to garner a Quorum for a
Proposal is simply a result of the new system and economy. In the old
days when voting was free, and in the not-so-old days when voting was
cheap, Players could adopt a policy of systematically voting on all
Proposals.

 Voting on all Proposals had the effect that one's vote could be as
whimsical as one wanted - voting for or against was just a way of
expressing an opinion, it wasn't something that could have serious
economic consequences, so it was hard to tell how the other Players
might vote on a given Proposal, which made the outcome of any given
Proposal volatile enough that if one did have any opinion at all on a
Proposal, it was safer to express that opinion lest a bad Proposal
unexpectedly pass, or a good one unexpectedly fail. There was a 
self-reinforcing tendency to vote systematically.

 This is no longer the case; Voting has become expensive, and not
Voting has become a safe way of not getting involved. Unless you see
that a given Proposal is getting a lot of people excited, if you
don't particularly care about that Proposal passing or failing the
safest course is to abstain, since nearly everyone else is likely to
abstain as well. The Proposer is just about the only person with a
vested interest in casting a vote. In other words, there's a
self-reinforcing tendency to abstain systematically.

Consider:  I declare a blanket ineligibility.  The CotC notes this, but just
marks me as ineligible as each CFJ is processed.  Later, a new player
registers.  Then e becomes CotC.  Then a CFJ is called, and the new CotC
assigns it to me.  *Then* the old CotC forwards my declaration to the new
CotC.

Question:  At the time of assignment, I had not sent a message to the
*current* CotC declaring ineligibility.  Was I ineligible anyway?

Generalization:  If the Rules say that something is conditional on sending
a message to an Officer, and that Office changes hands, and the message in
question hasn't been transferred to the new Officer yet, then what happens?

Ah, so you are saying there is a *potential* crisis.  Has this situation
actually happened?

>Question:  At the time of assignment, I had not sent a message to the
>*current* CotC declaring ineligibility.  Was I ineligible anyway?

I think it reasonable to interpret a Rule which says something must be
delivered to an Officer as meaning something is delivered to the Office, not to
a particular Player holding the Office.  So I would say, if the message has
been sent and received by the previous CotC, it has been delivered to the
Office of CotC and you are still ineligible.

In this particular case, I don't see it as a problem.  In the example you cite,
the Player has presumably made eirself ineligible for a reason and will bring
up the issue immediately upon being incorrectly assigned to it by the new CotC.

>Generalization:  If the Rules say that something is conditional on sending

I would say the condition has been permanently satisfied upon receipt of the
message by the original Officer, unless the Rules specifically negate the
condition upon a change of Officer.  IMO, this is the proper default way of
handling things, because I suspect most such lapses in passing information from
old to new Officer would be resolved before any real difficulties arise, as in
the example above.  If such a lapse *would* cause major problems in a
particular situation then, for that situation, the hand over to the new Officer
should be legislated in a way to prevent those problems.

I guess I'm just disappointed that people don't particularly care about
the house-keeping proposals that have been failing recently. It is obvious
to me that bug-fixing is an important part of the game, and things will
rapidly degrade if we continue to neglect it. I am willing to spend 
my VTs to maintain our Ruleset in this way, but I am frustrated that 
few players are willing to share that burden. And with the existing
Quorum problem, their inaction is actually a strong hindrance.

I suppose we always have legislative solutions available. Presence
will re-appear in a few weeks time.

So collect a dozen or so housekeeping proposals that have failed 
recently in one big proposal, and I'll vote for it. Seriously.

Perhaps we could allow the Speaker to declare, without objection, that a
given Proposal is a house-keeping Proposal on which Voting would be free.
Or how about simply allowing the Speaker to declare, without objection, that
a Proposal has passed.  While these minor Proposals can be important they
are not worth my VTs in the current economic climate.
