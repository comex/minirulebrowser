following:

      Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
      unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

You'll probably want to add an amendment repealing R1660, which
gives the Speaker the right to cast a third vote on some Proposals.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 1]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated as
         such by the Registrar.

      b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
         revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
         Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
         effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
         which is a Public Forum both before and after the designation
         or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
         messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
         designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
         inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
         deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      d) Any message is conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed
         to have been sent to the Public Forum.

      e) The above notwithstanding, any message sent, by any medium or
         combination of media, to every Active Player so that each
         Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it, is deemed
         to have been sent to the Public Forum, but only if it bears a
         clear indication that it is intended to be a Public Forum
         message.

      f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post", or
         "distribute" some communication or notification, that Player
         shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless the
         Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Well, I suppose.  Not truly necessary, though.  Nothing requires a
Rule to be non-vacuous. :)

R478 isn't that much of a mess. Your changes are only slightly clearer
than the current version.

Gladly. I will not bother with reporting FtR unless the Officer
concerned is the Registrar, or the electorate makes a request for
reporting a particular Officer's FtR that the Registrar persistently
fails to report emselves. Other than that, I see it as the Registrar's 
duty and privilege to deal with FtR.

Actually, R478 nowhere defines what "The Public Forum" is.  Taken on
its face, the only way to post to "The Public Forum" is using the
explicit method, which I can't recall anyone ever having used.
Current usage equivocates on "A Public Forum" versus "The Public
Forum", which is confusing and arguably stupid.

Also, I think long rules should have subrule markings for ease of
reference in discussion.  We've got some really ugly "kitchen sink"
rules (the worst of which is most definitely Rule 1445) that need
internal organization badly.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 2]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated as
         such by the Registrar.

      b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
         revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
         Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
         effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
         which is a Public Forum both before and after the designation
         or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
         messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
         designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
         inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
         deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

|     d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
|        have been sent to the Public Forum.

      e) The above notwithstanding, any message sent, by any medium or
         combination of media, to every Active Player so that each
         Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it, is deemed
         to have been sent to the Public Forum, but only if it bears a
         clear indication that it is intended to be a Public Forum
         message.

      f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post", or
         "distribute" some communication or notification, that Player
         shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless the
         Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Not having a copy of Black's, or any easy access to one, I would oppose
the creation of this rule.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 3]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

|     (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated as
         such by the Registrar.

|     (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
         revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
         Without Objection.  However, The message which is to
         effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
|         which is a Public Forum both before and after the
|         designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

|     (c) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
         messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
         designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
         inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
         deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

|     (d) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
         have been sent to the Public Forum.

|     (e) The above notwithstanding, any message sent, by any medium or
         combination of media, to every Active Player so that each
         Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it, is deemed
|         to have been sent to the Public Forum, but only if it bears
|         a clear indication that it is intended to be a Public Forum
         message.

|     (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post", or
         "distribute" some communication or notification, that Player
         shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless the
         Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a 
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
          (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
              three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
              Appeal; and 
          (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
              Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
              Players selected under subparagraph (1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board has not
          been successfully executed, it may (at its discretion)
          dismiss the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits
          of the Appeal.  A dismissal of this nature is without
          prejudice.

Winning

Be it further resolved, that Rule 112 be amended to read:

          that time no Win-Preventing Condition defined in the Rules
          also holds for that Player.

      (b) If no Rule (other than this one) defines any Winning
          Conditions, then a Player Wins upon each Winter and Summer
          Solstice, and upon each Vernal and Autumnal Equinox, with
          the Winner being chosen randomly by the Speaker from among
          all Voters not on Hold who are not ineligible to Win because
          of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

That may be so.  However, passing a proposal into law that will
necessarily result in people being ignorant is stupid, and there's
even less excuse for that.

With the exception of one week when I unilaterally gave the population
a universal amnesty (this being the week of Lee's Application for
Tolerance), it is and has always been my intention to report all
Failure to Report Infractions.

Ah.  Sorry.  I think you probably did receive a nomination from me.  I
guess I didn't bother to record it in the Registrar's report because I
figured that Election was your responsibility and not mine. 

My nomination messsage was as below:

While you're at it, why not eliminate the radnom win stuff altogether?
It seems to me that there is a rather general consensus that winning
isn't a main purpose of the game anyway, at the moment, and the random

That would appear to be right... There should be a provision for 
nonperformance of duties by the Vote Collector relating to the 
Nomination Period analogous to the provision which dictates that
lacking an announcement of results one week after the end of the
Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

For now though, Murphy is still It; the Election will indeed remain 
suspended until e announces the results, or deregisters or is deregistered.

An Election ends without a winner if more than seven days pass after
the close of voting without an announced winner.  I'm not sure what,
if any, relevance this has to the case where no Referendum is proper
because there was only one nominee.  Clearly, the Election Rules (like
most Rules in Agora) is inadequately robust.

But it's not the law yet, which is Blob's point.  The fact
that ignorance of Black's would not be an excuse is, in fact, a
good argument why this proposal should be opposed.

Whether Blob has "easy access" to a copy of Black's, though, depends
on your definition of "easy access" and how far away Blob is from
the UNSW library, which has a copy of Black's, 6th edition, in the
Law Reference section, on the 8th floor.  Its call number is
LREF/K127/B6/6.

If this passed, I'd do one of three things:
1) Leave in a Huff
2) Ignore it
3) Buy a copy of Black's and enforce this to the hilt.

I haven't decided which yet, but I'm leaning towards #3.  1/2 :)

Well, that would probably improve the rigor of interpretation quite a
bit.  It would also be interesting, in that we have several customary
uses which are contrary to Black's. :)

Which is why I shall oppose any attempt to create a law of which I am

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
	perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is

So even though you nominated, you didn't win the Election due to
nonperformance by Murphy. Speaker Morendil's call for Nominations is
therefore correct.

Call me uncommitted, but I define "easy access" as what I can do from 
my desk at Uni. I am not willing to make the 5-10 minute trek to the
Law Library simply to make a ruling for a game. If there were an online
copy, I'd consider it.

Sometimes the Internet is just plain spooky.

I'd say it doesn't matter how far away Blob is from the UNSW library -
or any other library for that matter. If playing Nomic requires to me to
go to the library every time I need to be certain about the meaning of a
term used in the Rules, it will be very inconvenient indeed. Even if
Black's is available on the Web, Scott's proposal would violate the long
held custom of keeping the game such that only access to email, and not
access to the Web, is required to play.

Forget I said that. We haven't had a Voting Period in this Election, so
that part of R1445 doesn't apply.

A glance at the Registrar's Report reveals that Cartographor Lee has not
Reported for several weeks, and hay indeed by guilty of Dereliction of
Duty. And if your amnesty for the Accountor is not continuing, then lee
should probably be reported for FtR for that Office as well.

The nonperformance provision of 1445 pertains to Referenda; in the 
present case there no Referendum has yet been initated.

I've tweaked this a little to improve clarity. So far, the proto says
nothing about rewarding Players for submitting Proposals which are
interesting and substantial, which is obviously what we'd like to see.
But I might leave this for future development.

Michael has already proclaimed his support and Scott his opposition. Any
other views pro or con?

####
Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Active Players not in their Grace Periods (henceforth in this
      Rule, 'Experienced Players') shall periodically incur a duty to
      submit a Proposal, as described in this Rule.

      The Registrar shall maintain an alphabetically sorted list of all
      Players, annotated as described in this Rule. The Registrar shall
      delete any deregistered Players, and add any newly registered
      Players, before performing the procedure below.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Week, the Registrar
      shall perform the following procedure, which accomplishes the
      selection of the Experienced Player(s) (usually there will be two,
      but occasionally there may be only one) to incur the duty to
      propose for that Week, the announcement of the names of those
      Players, and the updating of the list:

      (a) Experienced Players with an 'H' next to their names shall be
      selected before other Experienced Players. If there are more than
      two such Players, then the Registrar shall select the two highest
      on the list.

      (b) If, after selecting Experienced Players with an 'H' next to
      their names, there remain any places to be filled to bring the
      total number of Players selected for that Week to two, then the
      Registrar shall select the Experienced Player(s) highest on the
      list who do not have an asterisk ('*') next to their names. If
      there are not enough such Players, then only one Player is
      selected is selected for that Week.

      (c) The Registrar shall then announce in the Public Forum the
      names of the Player or Players who have been selected for that
      Week. These Players have two weeks from the time of the
      Registrar's announcement to submit a Proposal. 

      (d) The Registrar shall then place an asterisk ('*') next to the
      names of the Players selected for that Week. If any of these
      Players had an 'H' next to their names, it shall be removed. 

      (e) If it is ever the case that all Experienced Players have an
      asterisk next to their names, then the Registrar shall place an
      'H' next to the name of any Player who is On Hold and who does not
      have an asterisk next to eir name, and remove all asterisks from
      the list.

      As stated above, the Experienced Players selected by the Registrar
      each incur a duty to submit a Proposal within two weeks of the
      Registrar's announcement. Failure to do so is the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Registrar. The requirement to
      submit a Proposal placed upon a Player by this Rule lapses when
      the Player submits a Proposal, or when two weeks have elapsed from
      the time of the Registrar's announcement, whichever comes first.

I suggest that votes from now on should include a quote, with page number
and reference, from the Proceedings of the 13th International Conference
on Machine Learning. It's an International Conference, so I don't think
anyone should have trouble getting their hands on a copy. I have one 
right here on my desk...

I'm not studying or practising law - why would I have a copy of Black's?
I bet you don't have a copy of Wittgenstein's "Philosophical
Investigations", or Kripke's "Naming and Necessity".

Hm. "All modal operators appearing in the Rules shall be interpreted in
accordance with the framework S4.4, as axiomatized in Anderson and
Belnap's _Modal Logic_."

:)
