True, but it's an insignificant difference. And it doesn't affact my

Steve again makes the completely unwarranted assumption that because

"Gray" tends to be preferred in the U.S., while "grey" is more common
in the U.K. (and, apparently, Australia).

P.S. Tea flavored with oil of bergamot is called "Earl Grey" even in
the U.S. :)

I think it obvious that Steve has not made such an assumption.  I believe
that Steve's point is that a game doesn't have to have that flaw and e
wishes for Agora to be one of those games not so flawed.

His assumption is that any game that permits substantial inequities of 
wealth or power is equivalent to Monopoly.  This is false.

That's because "Earl Grey" is a person's name. You would expect me 
to change the speeling of your name if the local spelling of "chuck" 
was different, would you?

I would have said that his assumption is that any game that permits 
substantial, persistant inequities of wealth or power is not going to
be much fun, citing Monopoly as an example. In the absense of any 
counter-example I can imagine, I am willing to believe that this is 
true. If our experiments in economy are going to lead down that path,
them I am all for creating measures to counteract it.

Actually, having just made the first action with support, I think the
four day delay is just a nuisance. I really should have given this 
more thought before I drafted the With Support rule. It is not as 
neatly symmetrical to the Without Objection rule as I thought.

Steve, If you plan a proposal to fix the self-supporting bug, may I 
suggest that you also remove the four-day delay?

You've made the same assumption Steve wrongfully makes: that
substantial inequities have to be persistent.

I don't want to speak for Steve but I don't think that this was his
assumption at all.  What I get is that Steve believes that without proper
checks and balances an Agoran economy could develop the Monopoly Problem.
Steve recently said:

	Moderate and temporary inequities in wealth are completely consistent
	with the pursuit of that aim [creating a well-balanced game]. Massive
	and persistent inequities in the resources available to certain Players,
	with no checks or balances in place to correct the situation, are,
	however, symptoms of a badly	designed game.

So you can see that Steve is not opposed to inequity of wealth except in
those instances in which it creates a positive feedback loop such that it's
not possible for poor players to overtake wealthy ones.  This is very
clearly different than what you read into his concerns.

Have you actually READ his posts on the subject?  It was very clear to me
that Steve believes that substantial inequities do not have be persistent
and that it is one of his goals to design a game where they are not
persistent.  I must admit that I am at a loss to understand how you arrived
at this view of Steve's opinions.

Then I must conclude that Steve has drawn the line of where inequity
is "substantial" too narrowly; Steve has supported anti-inequity
measures too stringently such that there is no motivation to even
attempt to reserve resources.

Then why does he always move to quash even trivial inequities
immediately?  Either he has a bizarre notion of "substantial", or his
actions do not reflect his statements.

I agree that Steve has been over-zealous, but I'm not sure that it can be
entirely explained by his defining "substantial" too narrowly, although his
definition is narrow.  I think the real problem lies in his being too quick
to judge that inequities will in fact be persistent.  He doesn't allow
enough time for a system to prove itself one way or the other before he
proposes a correction.  Sometimes a system that appears unbalanced really
isn't, it may just take a while for it to settle into a natural balance...
or it may not balance at all.  Often the inequities result because Players
learn how to manipulate the system to their advantage.  But why should we
think that given time there will not be found ways to manipulate it that
bring things back onto a more even keel?  How can you know unless you let it
run its course for a while?

As I said in another post, I think it's because he's too quick to judge that
a system contains a positive feedback loop.  It's not that the inequities
are too substantial but that the system appears (to him) to be one where the
wealth gap is insurmountable.  No one wishes more than I that he would allow
more time for new systems to prove themselves.  These constant corrections
and changes to the system make it virtually impossible to develop a working
system.  I usually just get the idea behind one system when we're on to the
next.

Steve, I think you're goal is the right one but do you think we could
perhaps give more time to allow things to develop before we make
corrections?

This largely covers my objections to Steve's attitude toward our
fledling "economy".
