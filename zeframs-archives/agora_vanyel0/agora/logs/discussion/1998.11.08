Restricting posting to subscribers is done by putting the name of the
subscription file as one of the options in the list configuration.  If
that option can be a list of files (I am not sure, but that would be
sensible), then there should be no problem adding the name of a file
containing special addresses.

I think majordomo just ignores the part of the hostname before the second
last period.

Protoproposal Chaos46 [rev. 5]

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a 
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
          (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
              three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
              Appeal; and 
          (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
              Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
              Players selected under subparagraph (1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.  A dismissal of this nature is without prejudice.

I guess the rules concerning the duration of voting period overrule 
Blob's announced ending time, or can we vote on them anytime for 
the next two years?
