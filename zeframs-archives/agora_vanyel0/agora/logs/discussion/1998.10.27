I remind Players that the operation of A Duty to Vote is not altered by
the Voting Tariff. Failure to vote still incurs a 1 VT penalty. (All the
more reason to vote, since it's free.)

I foresee a problem if the Voting Tariff is ever set higher than 1 VT,
in that Failure to Vote will become cheaper than voting. An amendment
would appear to be in order.

Essentially, what I'm talking about is a near total deregulation of these
mechanisms.  Leave it to the individuals who have to do the work to choose
how they will do things and let the courts determine if the chosen method is
adequate.

If the mechanisms can be so highly customized to the needs and
preferences of individuals, doesn't that mean that it will be
extremely hard for a new officer to take over as recordkeepor? Even as
it is, Lee is finding it very hard to get started as Accountor, while
veteran recordkeepors like Crito seem to be in good control over their
job.

I think if recordkeeping is too complicated, it should be simplified,
not customized. Otherwise we become terribly dependent on the
experienced recordkeepors. This is undesirable on the role playing
level (you can't impeach or vote against people you can't replace) and
on the meta level (if such players leave the game, for example).

I think Lee's current problems also depend to a good degree on the
sheer number of POs and TOs around. Simplification is the issue, as
I've suggested with the monthly salary proposal.

I think this is a very cosmetic tweak, and hardly worth the effort.

Even if the voting tariff ever goes up so much, it doesn't make much
of a difference.

Similar situations appear, for example, if the proposal batch size
becomes larger - then the "Duty to Vote" rule also has much less power
to push people to vote on proposals they wouldn't care about if there
was no duty to vote.

But as long as you have the P-notes to spend, and voting is free,
minor cosmetic proposals like this at least increase the competition
for the top places in the proposal queue...

It would be ironic if the effects of a Duty to Vote were to make it
desirable not to vote in some circumstances.

Actually my real preference would be to put back the 1 Indulgence
penalty for Failure to Vote. This would give the Rule much greater bite.

In any case, these cosmetic tweaks can easily be incorporated into a
Proposal containing other things.

That was unnecessary. Surely minting 50 would have been more than
enough. Remember that Salaries from this week are 0, so you're not
likely to have to pay very many more POs from the Bank.

Not that it matters: you're free to destroy VTs in the Bank at will.

But "desirable" isn't the same as "cheap", is it? Even if the Duty to
Vote may encourage me to cast some more votes than I would without it,
_occasionally_ I also vote not because it is cheaper than not voting,
but because I want a proposal to pass or fail ;)

Now you'll have to forgive me because I've lost my teeth and my memory
ain't what it used to be, but I'm sure ol' General Chaos down the hall will
correct me if I make any mistakes or leave anything out; he's merely
ancient, whereas I'm decrepit. 

It all started way back in the days when Marks used to be reset on
Game's end. There was a loophole, you see, which meant that only
Player's Marks got destroyed; Marks in Group Treasuries were exempt.
This was back in the days when Groups still had Treasuries, long before
this new-fangled Order thingy they have now was adopted, with its
Payment Orders, and vacations and stays and...where was I?...oh, yes, I
remember, anyway, so there was this loophole, you see, so the Reform
Group - that was a Group we had back then...do they still have Groups
now, sonny? They do? Well, that's nice, I suppose...

...what was I saying? oh, yes, the Reform Group, well, there was me, and
Jeff, and General Chaos, only he called himself something different
then, if I recall, and there was another person named TAL, which stood
for Troublemaker At Large, but some people called him Stella? and they
spelled it just like that, with a question mark, but his real name was
Ronald Kunne, and he passed on a while ago now, but gee, I sure do miss
him sometimes...

...well, anyway, the four of us we started a kind of business acting as
a repository for people's Marks so that they could save them between
Game Ends, you see? At least I think that's how it was, it's so hard to
remember. But one day, we decided to dissolve the Group, and our
Ordinances stated that the Treasury was to be divided among the Group
Members, so all the investors got fleeced. There was a big CFJ about it
claiming that the Reform Group couldn't dissolve because its Ordinances
would let it, but I can't seem to find it...why can't I find anything
any more?...con sarn it...

My goals are much more modest: I would like to play in a game in which
VTs, P-Notes and Indulgences are all useful - and used - valuable, and
require different sorts of contributions to the game to acquire. I know
this is not impossible, because I have played other games in which it is
true. Take "Settlers of Catan" for example: it has 5 different kinds of
commodities, which players earn by developing different kinds of land,
which are necessary in various combinations to procure the things
necessary to win the game, and which players trade. It's an excellent
game. Now of course, Agora is not Settlers, and never will be, but the
abstract principles of good game design are pretty much universal, and
can be applied here as well as anywhere else. Indeed, we *have* been
applying them, with some success, for some time, and as a result, we
have a much more interesting system with our three commodities than we
have ever had before. But there's still room for improvment.

I felt that minting a million brand new VTs was inherently much more
fun than minting a pitiful fifty.  As it really makes no difference
how many there are in the Bank, why not have a whole pile?

Gleefully yours,

I think that's an excellent idea, better than the Blot amnesty, and very
much in the spirit of the Rebellion Rules. Why don't you write it up as
a proto?

The system I am working on now has transfers, notices of debt, and
demands for payment.  Transfers are recorded by Recordkeepors.
Notices of debt are recorded by the Chancellor and only apply to debts
involving the Bank.  Demands for payment are recorded by the Notary,
and are only used when an entity believes that it is entitled to be
paid some amount which it has not yet been paid.

Basically, this takes the Recordkeepors out of the business of
recording debts (essentially, Payment Orders) entirely; Recordkeepors
will only record transfers.

How would Salaries be handled under this system? Would I have to make a
demand for payment for my own Salary from the Bank, or would it be
handled as a notice of debt?

Yes, but much of the purpose of A Duty to Vote is precisely to correct
the situation that makes it cheaper not to vote at all, so it's a
significant flaw in the Rule that in certain circumstances it has
precisely the opposite effect.

I don't like the second half of this proposal. I would rather keep
the penalty as is. It adds an interesting dynamic to the setting of
the Voting Tariff. Set it below 1VT, and its worth your while to vote,
set it above and its worth your while not to. I think that is rather
elegant.

I find it rather amusing to watch how the Rebellion rule has developed.
Initially a Rebellion was a pretty harmless thing, instituted by Andre
for the ousting of Offices. I liked the metaphor, but found that Rebellions
were far too easy, and too "safe", so I protoed "Risky Rebellion", in 
order to make rebelling a bit more hazardous.

My original proto was quite "dangerous". It did what you are suggesting -
it took stuff away from the losers and gave it to the winners. Boy, was
that unpopular! I reprotoed it several times, eventually removing all
penalties for Abiding players, and making the rewards for Rebels quite
small. Still, it took three attempts at proposing it to get it to pass!

And now all these other Rebellion-related proposals have started cropping
up, adding more interesting twists, and increasing the "dangerousness"
of the process. It amazes me to see how the political climate has changed
in the past year or so.

You are quite right. Now, what do I do now? Can I just resend it, in
the non-truncated form? I'm not sure. R107 says it shall "guide play in
the form in which it was voted on". And it _has_ already been voted on.

The Registrar would issue a Notice of Debt to the Chancellor, who
would be expected to pay that debt in due course.  If e doesn't pay it
quickly enough for your tastes, you can file a Demand for Payment

It is not, however, a Proposal, as we established during the Great
Officer Veto Scam. What you have to do is redistribute it, with a fresh
Voting Period.

Sounds promising. It should certainly simplify Recordkeeping by
alleviating one of the things lee listed as a pet hate: having to match
up Transfer Orders with Payment Orders.

Rulekeepor Chuck, I suggest the following unofficial Annotation to

======================================================================

Appelate decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Justiciar Morendil:

The Judge of this Statement presented a clear and concise argument in
favor of the decision. However, I find some of his reasoning flawed;
in particular, I believe that Rule 1339, cited therein, is evidently
not relevant, and I further believe that Rule 754 is not relevant
either.

Should we interpret Rule 754 such that the difference between the text
submitted by Swann as "The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal" and
that posted by Promotor Blob under that title is *not*
"inconsequential", that would not necessarily imply that Swann's
Proposal was *not* distributed. Such an interpretation would merely
imply that Rule 754 is silent on the matter.

Judge Kolja observes that the difference between the two texts is not
one of "spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a word
or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation", and draws the conclusion
that, since Rule 754 does not cover this particular kind of
difference, that difference is significant and the truth of the
Statement follows.

However, I find this line of reasoning suspicious in the extreme,
because it would lead us to regard as distributed a Proposal submitted
with the text "A Rule shall be enacted reading thus :" but posted by
the Promotor as "Yo man, let's create a Rule thingy like this here:",
a discrepancy far greater than the minor difference between Swann's
submission and what Promotor Blob posted.

However, I believe that Rule 754 does not govern in such cases; it is
my interpretation that it only concerns *original* statements by
Players. For instance, Rule 754 would apply in the case of a Player
posting a text labeled as an "Aplication to start a Gourp", which
would be considered unambiguously equivalent to an Application to
create a Group.

In the case at hand, however, the Rules require the Promotor to
distribute the text that was submitted to em, not a variation on it;
therefore, it is not enough that (as Rule 754 has it) "the meaning or
validity of such communication is not altered in any way by such
discrepancies"; it must further be the case that such a text be "the
same", in some reasonable sense, as the one which was submitted to em,
for *that* text to have been distributed.

In other words, the issue really hinges on the notion of identity. No
two copies of the text of a given Proposal are, of course, 'identical'
in the strictest sense; nevertheless we use an approximation of
considering two bodies of text to be 'identical' when they differ only
in minor particulars. We don't use a formal definition of how 'minor'
the variations need to be, however, expect as far as Rule changes are
concerned (Rule 1339); we rely on an intuitive notion of it, which, I
suppose, could be expressed as 'two bodies of text are identical if a
computer program such as diff would consider them identical.'.

Because this notion is not formalized, except in Rule 1339, I
believe the Rules are silent on the matter. I also think it is in the
best interests of the game not to allow a risk of Players voting for a
Proposal unless they are provided with the "exact" (in the above vague
sense) text of that Proposal. I further think that the discrepancy
between the text submitted by Swann and that distributed by Promotor
Blob violates the amovementioned intuitive notion of identity.

I thus find myself in agreement with the original Judgement of TRUE,
although unable to support the reasoning behind it. I therefore
choose to Sustain.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Speaker Steve:

I follow Justice Morendil a long way in his reasoning. I agree with
him that Rule 754 is not really relevant here (although the question
of the relevance of R1339 is one I will return to later), and that
the issue turns on the question of the identity of texts, that is,
on the circumstances under which we should be prepared to say that
two texts are 'the same'. I agree with Morendil that on this issue
the Rules are silent. I agree that our Judgements should therefore
reflect commonsense and the best interests of the game, in accordance
with R217.

However, the argument he gives that the best interests of the game
are served by applying a very strict notion of identity ('identity
under diff' as we might call it) has been effectively rebutted by
Kolja, who pointed out that R107 guarantees that whatever gets
distributed is what Players are voting on. So the question of whether
identity under diff really is the best notion of identity for us to
use remains open, as far as the arguments that presented by Morendil
are concerned. That is not to say that identity under diff should be
rejected - far from it. It is one of a number of standards now
awaiting a defence which are competing for our attention.

Certainly identity under diff has advantages which Morendil does not
explicitly mention. It is simple and easy to apply, yielding clear
answers in most cases. Perhaps it is to be preferred for this reason.
Yet there are arguments against it. Consider capitalization, for
instance. Former Rulekeepor Wes arbitrarily changed the capitalization
of many Rules in ways that would violate identity under diff, and yet
we accepted those changes as not changing the identity of the Rules.
So historically speaking, simple identity under diff does not seem to
be the standard that we have used in judging whether two texts are
the same.

One could argue in addition that identity under diff is not the
standard that we should use, on the grounds that it is too strict. If
strict identity under diff is to be our standard, then no typo
introduced into a Proposal by the Promotor, however miniscule, will
ever be considered insignificant. I don't think that is a desirable
outcome. (That's not to say that no typo - in particular, the one
introduced into P3710 - should be considered significant.) In that
case, the simplicity of identity under diff, supposedly its strength,
may actually be a weakness: it may be too simple to meet our needs.

The challenge then is to say in what ways identity under diff should
be relaxed, or with what it should be replaced. I propose to do what
I can to develop an alternative standard. To do that, we need to have
a clear understanding of what our needs are. As I've already intimated
above, I don't think it's desirable (ie in the best interests of the
game) that every typo introduced by the Promotor into a Proposal
should invalidate the distribution of the Proposal. I think we would
be best served by a standard which enabled us to say, at least some
of the time, "Well, sure, there's a typo, but it's still the same
Proposal." So strict identity under diff is out.

Working from the other end, equally clearly we don't want to allow a
situation in which it would legal for the Promotor deliberately to
make substantial changes to a Proposal, and then offer as a defence,
"Well, sure, it's completely different, but it's still the same
Proposal." So, as a proposed standard, 'anything goes' is also out.

That knocks out the extreme positions, leaving a large territory in
the middle to explore. One temptation is to begin by distinguishing
between accidental and deliberate changes introduced into a Proposal,
and to completely rule out the latter. But I think that temptation
should be resisted. If we had case where a Promotor had corrected
a spelling mistake before distributing a Proposal, I think our
standard should allow us to say that the Proposal has been distributed.

A better strategy returns us to R1339: if two collections of text
have different effects when adopted, then those collections of text
are not the same. (Note that this does not imply that if two
collections of text have the same effects when adopted, they should
be regarded as the same.) Nevertheless, if a change introduced by
the Promotor, either accidentally or deliberately, results in a
text different in its effects when adopted than the text submitted
to the Promotor, then I think that this is sufficient to show that
the texts are not identical. Since R1339 is very clear that the
change introduced by Promotor Blob into Swann's Proposal results
in a text with a different effect, I think we have no choice but to
conclude that Promotor Blob did not distribute Swann's Proposal.

I therefore sustain Kolja's Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clerk of the Courts Michael

My fellow Justices have done all of original thinking on this
question.  This is appropriate because my own position is somewhat
compromised by my position as Judge of the similar CFJ 1090.  I agree
with the conclusions reached by Steve and Morendil and my ultimate
decision is to sustain Kolja's original reasoning.

My own instinct as to the best way of deciding whether or not two
texts are the same is to perform a "diff" modulo any explicit
provisions granted by the rules.  My fellow Justices seem averse to
this idea, and have come up with alternative ways of demonstrating
that the relevant texts in this case are different.  Particularly
compelling is the demonstration that the meanings of the two texts are
different, in the sense that if they were to be adopted, their effects
on the game would be different.

(This argument, an extensional one, appeals to the fact that if f(x)
is not equal to f(y) then x is not equal to y, where x and y are our
texts and f is our function for constructing the meaning of our
texts.)

I am happy with the intensional argument to the effect that
  i) the two texts in this case are demonstrably different, and
 ii) the rules do not allow us to consider them the same.

In any case, the original judgement is clearly correct.

======================================================================
Original Judgement

Judgement: TRUE

Reaons and arguments:

Rule 1483/3 (Definition of Proposals) reads, in part,

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

Based on this definition and the publically known facts, it is clear
that the proposal ("collection of text, delivered to the promotor with
the clear indication etc..") referred to in the statement for this
judgement was created, and exists.

This proposal was then given a number and placed in the proposal queue
(even if its text was not rendered correctly in the inofficial part of
the document in which the Promotor published the proposal queue at the
time). For the number note that at the time in question R109 was still
in the old form 109/2, which assigned proposal numbers at the time of
submission, not distribution. For the text note that R1036 states that
"The actual text of the Proposals in the Queue need not be published."
Therefore, the proposal queue did contain the proposal.

However, while the text of a proposal or its scrambled rendition in
the publication of the Proposal Queue has no legal significance for
the state of the proposal queue, R1770 (Distributing Proposals)
requires that "Proposals" be distributed, i.e. the body of text that
consitutes the proposal.

In the case of P3710, this didn't happen, and the difference between
the distributed body of text and the true proposal 3710 is not
insignificant. The only rules that deny minor differences between
texts any significance are Rule 754/3 (Spelling and Grammar Errors)
and Rule 1339/6 (Precision in Rule Changes) which allow "Differences
in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a word or
phrase by a synonym or abbreviation [...] as long as there is no
ambiguity in meaning" resp. "Variations in whitespace or
capitalization in the quotation of text in an existing Rule to be
removed or replaced". However, the differing parts of P3710 and the
distributed text were "Proposal <proposal number> at time" and
"Proposal <proposal numberat time", and do not contain a difference
covered by the quoted rules.

Therefore the text distributed by the Promotor was not the Proposal
submitted by Swann and entitled "The Great Officer's Veto Scam
Proposal", and the statement for this judgement is true.

Although it isn't strictly relevant to this statement for judgement, I
would like to add that the above arguments imply that the text
distributed wasn't proposal 3710, either. According to this
interpretation, P3710 is still in the proposal queue; the Promotor
broke the rules governing the distribution of proposals because e did
not yet distribute it, and, in addition, published wrong proposal
queue listings. Additionally, one might argue that the votes that
players and other voting entities tried to cast on P3710 were cast
before the voting period on this proposal began and were thus illegal
according to Rule 683/5 (Legal Votes). They should also not have led
to POs according to 1442. The attempt to make the proposal a Senate
Proposal was ineffective for the same reason.

======================================================================


(Caller's) Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo not
present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims that,
therefore, Swann's Proposal was not distributed.

I don't think he can do this.  Rule 1770 only permits the distribution
of one batch of Proposals each week, and a batch has already been
distributed.  As I read it, the options are:
* Neither 3800 nor 3801 has been distributed, and no distribution has
  taken place this week.
* 3801 has been distributed (with the wrong number) as part of an
  undersized batch (this being two nonreversible errors).  The
  Proposal known as "3800" has not been distributed, remains on top of
  the queue, and will be eligible for distribution next week (subject
  to any changes in the queue which may yet occur).

How can you cast two votes FOR an obviously truncated Proposal?  Don't
you even read the Promotor's distribution?

Yes, the need to do this would only occur if a dispute arose over
whether a given debt had been satisfied, and that process would
necessarily be judicial.

The "ideal" solution would be to redistribute it in its correct form,
cancel all votes cast up to now, and extend the voting period.
Unfortunately, there is no statutory support for such an action, and I
doubt that our current Judicial Rules give a Judge enough authority to
Order such an action.

The more Platonic of our Players would state that Proposal 3800 has
not yet been distributed and that the last batch contained only one
Proposal.  This leads to all sorts of possible conclusions, and I
don't have the spare brain waves right now to sort all of them out.

I don't have a conclusive position as to what the current state of the
law is in this situation.

(Maybe I'll write a Proposal to establish the solution given above for
an error in the reproduction of the text of a Proposal.)

Re: DIS: Re: OFF: New Proposals: 3800 - 3801

Although the prior precedent lends more weight to the second of these two. 
However, I'm not objecting just yet.  I need to look at the Rules more
carefully.

Re: DIS: Failure to Report?

I must be missing something.  We're *still* going to have to match transfers to
debts, whether you call them Payment Orders or not.  Looks to me like that
burden has just been shifted from the Recordkeepors to the Chancellor - and
e'll have to keep track of *all* currencies under this scheme, checking every
transfer to see if it satisfies some debt.  Is this really what you have in
mind?

Yes, the need to do this would only occur if a dispute arose over
whether a given debt had been satisfied, and that process would
necessarily be judicial.
