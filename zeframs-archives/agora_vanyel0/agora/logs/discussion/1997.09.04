Very elegant, Jeff. You manage to answer the question posed by the 
Statement without resolving who it is in fact that is required to 
report changes in Blots in various circumstances. But this more
prosaic question still interests me. I tried to answer it in my
Judgement, but as I still haven't seen Morendil' objections (although
subsequent remarks of his give good hints as to what they must be),
I can't be completely certain that I did so properly. At any rate,
I can be reasonably sure that this question hasn't yet been answered
to Morendil's satisfaction, and I'd like to achieve that if possible.

So: an open question to Scott, Jeff, Morendil and anyone else who
might care to express an opinion. Let's take a very specific case,
mentioned in my Judgement. In the case where the Infraction of
Delayed COE Response (defined in R1431) has been committed, who, if
anyone, is required to report the 'change in Blots'? Explain your
answer.

For the record, here's my answer to the above question. It's the
answer you'd intuitively expect: the Player making the COE is
required to report the change in Blots. R1431 states that:

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim.

I note, however, (which I did not note in my Judgement) that there is
a certain ambiguity here, similar to one also found in R1504, as to
precisely what it is the Player who posted the Claim is required to
report. Is it the commission of the Infraction? Is it the commission
of the Infraction and the incursion of the penalty? Just the
incursion of the penalty? My answer falls out most straightforwardly
if we take either of the latter two views, for then the Player who
posted the Claim will be required to report the incursion of a 1 Blot
penalty, and surely even Morendil will agree that such a report
constitutes a report of a change in Blots, and so meets the condition
in R1435 as to who is to execute the Payment Orders for Indulgences
arising out of gains in Blots.

But let's be as generous to Morendil as we can be. What if we defend
the first of the possibilities described above, that R1431 requires
the Player who posted the Claim only to report the incursion of the
Infraction, and nothing more? Now Morendil's claim that R1435 does not
succeed in specifying a Player who is to report the change in Blots
looks more plausible. But that still leaves us with the by-now familiar
observation that even if R1435 doesn't specify anyone, R1504 certainly
does:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

So even if we resolved the ambiguity in R1431 in favour of the
interpretation that the Player making the Claim is required by that
Rule only to report the commission of the Infraction and nothing else,
R1504 requires that same Player to execute the necessary Payment
Orders for Indulgences, and this report, I hope Morendil will agree,
constitutes a report of a change in Blots. Therefore, it appears
that regardless of the stance one takes with respect to the ambiguity
in R1431, it is, as I claimed, the Player who posted the Claim who is
required to report a change in Blots arising from the commission of
the Infraction of Delayed COE Response.

I have tried, in the argument offerred above, to be both as clear
and explicit in my reasoning and my assumptions as I can be, and
as generous to Morendil as my respect for him warrants. I am sure
that if elements of my argument remain dissatisfactory to him, he
will soon answer with his reasons.

Hi Steve,

I was just wondering what your plans are concerning the public votinh
proposal of yours that failed recently. IIRC, that failure was only
due to some technical problems in voting (or mailing as a whole, or
some such thing). So why not try again, now the new lists are running?
I still like the idea of experimenting with that.

To limit the effect of another Rule, 1513 would at the very least have to
take Precedence over it.

Rule 1513 seems to be making the very fishy assumption that Rules are not
Nomic Entities. If we don't accept this assumption we must consider
whether its Precedence Clause might put itself above some other Rules.

I consider it a general principle(*) that 1482 cannot be unseated by
low-Powered Rules (besides, 1513 doesn't try to do this in any case) and
so high-Powered Rules are above 1513. This includes 1030. 

The Precedence requirement of 1513 does seem to imply that lower-numbered
Rules take Precedence, and so 1513 cannot be construed as trying to take
Precedence over lower-numbered Rules.

This implies that 1513 will take Precedence over higher-numbered Power=1
Rules, and may manage to strip them of their ability to require Player
actions without being made available.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Intereseting, except I would say, since R101 says "must obey *all* the Rules"
that this prevents R1513 from having any effect on higher-numbered Power=1
Rules.

Except you quoted a fragment out of context, R101 does not say that, it
says a much weaker statement about Rules in effect, _and_ it is annotated
with the fact that it applies to the Rules as a whole and not to each
individual Rule.

There is nothing in principle against 1513 stripping other Rules of their
effects or part of it, but Precedence considerations implies that it
cannot in its current form succeed against anything but higher-numbered
Power=1 Rules.

Greetings,

True.  I did address these two issues ("in effect" and "Rules as a whole"), in
my other two recent posts on this subject.  It seems, however, that I am
bucking game custom in insisting that it is possible for an individual rule to
be in conflict with R101.  I will defer to this interpretation.

I agree with this analysis, based on the prevailing interpretation of obeying
the "Rules as a whole".

So does it me - I'll have to check the record for cases of Infractions
being reported without the corresponding PO being executed at the same
time, I'm sure there must have been a few of those.

However, I too am quite satisfied with the Judgement of the Board of
Appeals now - no stone has been left unturned, which is the way
I like things to be. :)

By the Appellate decision, with which I agree to the extent that
elJefe's ruling on the absence of a conflict between 1504 and 1435
governs, this is the Player required, by 1504, to execute (which
implies, by Game Custom, to report) a PO in Indulgences, the act
itself constituting a change in Blots. Thus, indirectly, in this
instance, the Player who originated the COE.

You did address the question in your Judgement, and claimed that it
was unclear but that either of the latter views could be taken; I
refuted this argument (and I do believe this would be confirmed by
the Courts) by pointing out that 'to be reported by' is a phrase of
art used for the purpose of satisfying the provision of 1503 stating

      Any Rule that defines an Infraction must also specify a
      Player or Players who are authorized to detect and report
      the commission of that Infraction; otherwise, the Infraction
      carries no penalty.

We need not ascribe any further legal purpose to the phrase 'to be
reported by', I think.

Quite - you've been more than fair. :)

1504 is obviously my downfall in this instance, but that is not
new - Michael had raised the issue a while back. I had replied then,
as I did more recently in response to Scott's raising the issue again
(_after_ delivering a summary Appelate Judgement, damn his twisted
Jurist's soul to whatever hell Jurists are consigned to), that the
language in 1435 took precedence over that in 1504 - which naturally
implied a conflict between the two Rules.

ElJefe ruled that there is no conflict. I can offer no counterargument
because there is no precedent to support either his decision or the
alternative, and thus he had every right to cut the Gordian Knot. But
this is what I take the decisive issue : whether Rule 1435, attempting
to specify a Player as being charged with a certain duty, but failing
to specify any particular Player, was in conflict with 1504, also 
charging a Player with the same duty, but successful in specifying that
Player.

I do not accept elJefe's argument that 1504 and 1435 could independently
authorize different Players to execute the same POs, however, because I
think the clause '[a PO] to be executed by whomever is required to report
the change in Blots' would indeed conflict with 1504's assignment of the
same duty to a different set of Players. However, I agree with elJefe that
my contention that the set defined by Rule 1435 is empty justifies the
view that 1504's own specification is therefore effective.

Two in fact:

1) The Title is misspelled.
2) "Assessor"  should be "Vote Collector". 

Fortunately, I guess it is quite rare to declare presence on Referenda,
since they are free to Vote on. So there have probably not been any
mistakes yet.

There have been. I can think of at least two occasions on which
Players have declared themselves Present for Elections. I suppose I
should dig those cases up and make sure Quorum was not affected. But
I'd so much rather not.

Ha. Starting, of course, with myself. I shall now change the headers
of this message to redirect it to agora-discussion@gecko.

This is a subject with a long and complex tradition among scholars
of jurisprudence. Lon Fuller discusses it in his landmark 1931 book,
_Legal Fictions_, which I shall now have to reread, I suppose. Here
I'll just restrict myself to remarking that there is no reason to
assume that either all cases must be described as creating legal
fictions, or all cases must be described as cases of redefinition.
Subtly different pressures will push us in different directions
in different cases. Fuller discusses the cases of 'trover', the
doctrine in English common law that items forcibly repossessed in order
to pay debts or compensation are treated as having merely been 'found'.
Is the effect here that of creating a legal fiction to the effect
that the items in question were merely found, or is the effect that
of giving the verb 'to find' a special legal significance it doesn't
ordinarily have? The answer is not clear.

I don't think this example serves you well, however. In the first
place, it might plausibly be argued that the definitions in Rules
1706-1710 have nothing to do with position, location, distance,
movement, paths, or any such things in the real world, but only with
Position, Location, Distance, Movement, Paths, and so on, which
distinction is marked by the use of capitalization. There no reason
to think that 'location' (small 'l') is being redefined here, or for
that matter that a legal fiction is being created to the effect that
your location is anywhere other than where you, Charles E. Carroll,
are physically located.

In the second place, even granting you your view that R1706 redefines
'location', giving it a special legal significance it doesn't already
have, it doesn't follow that you are violating your hypothetical Rule.
For if 'location' has been redefined, then it follows that for legal
purposes, your location is not the University of Wisconsin computing
labs, but the Origin, or whatever. So you wouldn't be violating the Rule.

Rather than sit around waiting for stuff to happen so I can get a feel for
game custom, I'm just going to ask about it...

Is it game custom to send out proto-proposals before making proposals?

Vir

Expect a lot of questions over the next few weeks before I get into the
swing of things...
