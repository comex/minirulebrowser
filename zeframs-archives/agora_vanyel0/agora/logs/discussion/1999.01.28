R1842 makes me Kolja's sole Executor. I don't think stops him from

That's a sensible interpretation, but one that I suspect may be
inconsistent with game custom. I can't provide specific examples, but it
seems to me that we have on occasion accepted resent messages as having
been sent at the time of their original transmission, where this has
made a difference to the legal effect of a message.

What is to stop me from predicting that every proposal will pass, and
that every proposal will fail? Then I'm guaranteed a Seal for each
proposal.

There needs to be a restriction against conflicting predictions - or
better yet, a penalty for a wrong prediction, which would discourage
simple guessing. (So that if you're not really sure about your prediction,
you are better off not betting.)

I certainly have never done so.  I can recall a few cases where a
"resent" message has been used as evidence to prove that a message was 
sent, usually in conjunction with a statement from another Player that 
e saw the original, but that's different from allowing a message
inadvertently sent to a non-PF to be cured as of the date it was
originally sent to the non-PF merely by resending it to a PF.

I'm not sure about 23 January, but today I checked, and found that all
players are subscribed to nomic-discussion. In fact, the only person who
is described to nomic-official and nomic-business but not to nomic-discussion
is KoJen.

I also took two more steps based on the lists of subscribers of the various
email lists:
1. As list manager of the backup-list at tue.nl, I manually subscribed Macross
and Peekee, who were not on this list, and unsubscribed and subscribed
Morendil, who was subscribed under another address.

Vlad, Harlequin and Jtael, as well as many watchers that I do not know a
name from, are also not subscribed to the backup list, as is also the case
for Proglet's second address. Several other addresses (among which elJefe's
easynet address and lee's aol address) are subscribed to the backup list, but 
not to the main lists. Michael is known as Michael.Norrish@cl.cam.ac.uk to
the gecko lists, but as mn200@cl.cam.ac.uk to the tue list.

2. As Registrar I changed the watcher statuses. Those that do not currently
receive the lists have been removed, this holds for JonRock, Uri Bruck, Nick,
Xanadu and Leadryl Dracos. On the other hand, former players who still do
have been added. These are Jtael, KoJen, Vlad, Vanyel, Swann, Antimatter,
Harlequin and Proglet. Outside the former players, the findmail-lists and 
the named watchers (only BethMo, harvel and Poulenc remaining of these), 
there appear to be 11 more watchers, of whom only 2 receive the backup list.
On the other hand Nick and 5 unknowns receive the backup list but not
the main lists.

Greetings all. When we removed most of the Rules pertaining to
Winning, thus making it a rare rather than a routine thing, I heartily
approved. At the time, that aspect of the game tended to be
uncompetitive and rather boring. However, since then it seems that the
removal of what competitive impulse these Rules provided has made
Agora a bit duller. True, there is competition for resources, but I
think we can make things more interesting and encourage participation
by adding another dimension. I have therefore tried to revive the
concept of winning while fixing some of the problems we had with it
originally by altering the whole conception of it.

Vlad

The following is not a Proposal. My comments are in brackets.

Protoproposal Vlad-GAT1:
The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by •

• 	Create a Rule with the Following Text

The Grand Agoran Tournament

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. At the beginning of each
Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For the
first Round, this will be done instead in descending order of the
Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the most recent
Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random selection. 

	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are more
Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to the Nth
Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are exactly as
many spots as Players. The First Circle spots are filled with the
highest ranked Players from the preceding Round, and so on down the
remainder of the Circles in order. After the above procedure, if a
Player is assigned a Circle below that of another Player with whom e
was tied at the end the last Round, that Player shall be moved into
the same Circle as the Player with whom e was tied. The initial Score
for each Player in each Round is zero.
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule with an initial Score of zero.

[The Circle system I consider the heart of this Proposal. The
Circle system allows Players to compete against others with a similar
amount of time to devote to the game/of a similar skill level. This
should hopefully increase competitiveness among all Players, not just
those at the top.]

• Add a new Rule with the following text

Competitions

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round the Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams.

•	Create a Rule with the following text:

Application to Form a Team

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

[The Team Competition adds an interesting new dimension, combining
cooperation with competition. The requirement to have the Players come
from different Circles makes all Players desirable to have on one’s
team.]

• 	Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Scorekeepor

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.

	A Scorekeepor has the privilege of making a Proposal To Change
Scoring once per Round. Such a Proposal must be made no more than two
weeks and no less than one week before the end of the Round. A
Proposal To Change Scoring must have no effect, if passed, other then
to change the basis for Scoring, or it is invalid. If valid, a
Proposal to Change Scoring has the following special characteristics:

1) It is automatically Disinterested and Sane.
2) It automatically has a Priority one higher than the Priority of the
proposal(s) with the highest Priority currently in the Proposal Queue.
If a Proposal in the Queue has its Priority raised to be equal or
higher than the Proposal to Change Scoring, the PtCS has its Priority
raised an equal amount, if possible.

[Basic stuff. Of course, the Scoring Rule can be changed in
conventional ways, but I felt it was good to have a way of easily
making changes between Rounds. Question: Should the Scorekeepor be a
competitor in the GAT?).]

•	Create a Rule with the following text:

Scoring:

	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which may
define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive points
only for actions which occur during the current Round, although those
actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus, for
example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of the
current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.

	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 2 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 2
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.



	Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from
the following events is the responsibility of the Player scoring the
Points. Changes must be reported to the Scorekeepor or the Public
Forum.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1)

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 20 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 10 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 20 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 5 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 10 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 3 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 10 Points.


[Any scoring system, both in the assignment of point values to actions
and in the selection of actions themselves will be arbitrary. I sought
to have a large number of scoring actions, of various levels of
difficulty. I am open to suggestions for other scoring methods.]

•	Create a Rule with the following Text:

Scoring Patent Titles

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
‘Pseudo-Victor Nth Circle’ (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal
corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of “Pseudo-Team Victor”

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

[This replaces the current Champion PTs]

• Rule 755 “Champions” is hereby Repealed.

• Rule 1465 “Champion’s Reward” is hereby Repealed.

• Rule 1498 “Winning by Blots” is hereby Repealed.

• Rule 1580 “Multiple Winners of a Single Game” is hereby Repealed.

• Rule 1622 “Forfeiting the Game” is hereby Repealed.

• Rule 1697 “Multiple rapid wins prohibited” is hereby Repealed.

[Clearing out the detritus of the old system. 112 is left alone for
now since repealing it now would give this Proposal an AI of 3. I
think it is best if 1638 stay as long as 112 is still on the books,
although it is irrelvant to the GAT.]

• Rule 1764 “Public Voting” is hereby Repealed.

[A fine Rule, but I like my scoring system for Proposals, which would
be undercut by this Rule. Any Proposal bookie system also benefits by
eliminating this Rule. I hope Steve doesn’t hold this against this
Proposal.]

• Amend Rule 1435  “Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate”
by removing the last sentence “It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots.”

• Amend Rule 1729 “Insanity” by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Score.

[Needed to complete the installation of the new system.]

Zero Payment Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

Executorship

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
            three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
            Appeal; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
            Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
            Players selected under subparagraph (a)(1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.

Protoproposal Chaos77 [rev. 1]

Chop, Chop, Chop

[This Proposal eliminates both SLCs and Organizations, constructs that
we are making essentially no use of.]

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1643 be amended to read:

      (a) A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
          the following requirements:
        (1) it has been posted to the Public Forum;
        (2) it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of
            Policy";
        (3) it specifies, by name, an Office to which it pertains; and
        (4) that Office is held by its author.

      (b) Once posted in accordance with subdivision (a) of this Rule,
          a Statement of Policy is binding upon the Player who issued
          it for as long as it remains in force.

      (c) An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
          Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.
          Further, any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever
          the Office it pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it
          constrains.

      (d) Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of
          Policy, a Class 2 Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document.

      (b) A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
          belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
          its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when
          that entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
          executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
          submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will
          (excepting those which e cannot execute or cannot execute
          successfully, for whatever reason), and will then divide the
          remaining residual assets as provided by the Will.

      (c) A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an
          Application to Create a Will.  Such an Application must
          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity.

Hey! You might not be making good use of your Group, but we at the Order
are. I'm not sure we need such complicated mechanism just to support Groups,
but I don't want to see them just disappear.

A (hopefully) prettied-up version)

Vlad

The following is not a Proposal. My comments are in brackets.

Protoproposal Vlad-GAT2:
The Grand Agoran Tournament
This Proposal consists of a number of Proposed Rule Changes, each
marked by *

* 	Create a Rule with the Following Text

The Grand Agoran Tournament

	The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and October
of each year, and last for three months. At the beginning of each
Round, the Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For the
first Round, this will be done instead in descending order of the
Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the most recent
Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random selection. 

	The Scorekeepor will then define a number of Circles among
which the Active Players will be partitioned. These must be as few as
possible, but there is a minimum of three Circles and an initial
maximum of six Players per Circle. They are designated the First
Circle Second Circle, etc. ... Nth Circle. The First Circle is the
highest ranking Circle, and the Nth Circle is the lowest ranking
Circle.
	 The initial number of spots in each Circle will be the number
of Active Players divided by the number of Circles (FRD). If there are
more Players than spots the Scorekeepor will add one spot to the Nth
Circle, then one to the N-1th Circle, etc. until there are exactly as
many spots as Active Players. The First Circle spots are filled with
the highest ranked Players from the preceding Round (skipping
Inactive Players), and so on down the remainder of the Circles in
order. After the above procedure, if a Player is assigned a Circle
below that of another Player with whom e was tied at the end the last
Round, that Player shall be moved into the same Circle as the Player
with whom e was tied. The initial Score for each Player in each Round
is zero.
	When a Player joins the game e is automatically assigned to
the same Circle e held when e deregistered (if applicable and
possible), or else the lowest Circle. A Player going On Hold is
automatically withdrawn from the current Round of competition. A
Player coming Off Hold is treated as a new Player for the purposes of
this Rule with an initial Score of zero.

[The Circle system I consider the heart of this Proposal. The
Circle system allows Players to compete against others with a similar
amount of time to devote to the game/of a similar skill level. This
should hopefully increase competitiveness among all Players, not just
those at the top.]

* Add a new Rule with the following text

Competitions

The Individual Competition
	At the end of each Round the Player with the highest Score in
eir Circle wins that Round for that Circle and receives the
corresponding Scoring Patent Title. Any Player winning eir Circle has
the option of not participating in the Round immediately following. To
exercise this option, the Player must post eir wishes to the Public
Forum within two weeks after the beginning of the Round e is opting
out of. The Player then receives no Score, and is ineligible for SPTs.
The next Round the Scorekeepor shall seed the Player based on the
score that Player received two Rounds previously.

The Team Competition
	The Team Competition runs parallel to and concurrently with
the Individual Competition. A Team consists of a group of Players who
have signed an Application to Form a Team within two weeks of the
beginning of the Round in which they wish to compete. If fewer then
two Teams register for a round, there is no Team Competition that
Round. A Team's Score is the combined Scores of its members. A Team
wins the Team Competition if at the end of that Round its Score is
greater than that of the other registered Teams.

*	Create a Rule with the following text:

Application to Form a Team

There is a type of Application called an Application to Form a Team
(AFT). A valid AFT, in order to have effect upon Execution, must
contain the following:

i)	The name of the proposed Team.
ii)	The Players who will compose the Team, which must include the
Sponsor.
iii)	The Signatures of the Players who will compose the Team.

The Sponsor of an AFT will be known as the Team Captain for the
duration of the Round.

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
i)	The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
ii)	No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
iii)	No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
Team.
If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team is
immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team Competition.

A valid AFT is Executed by sending it to the Scorekeepor or submitting
it to the Public Forum.

The effect of Execution of an AFT is the entrance of the proposed Team
into the current Team Competition. A Team is automatically dissolved
at the end of the current Round, but may register again in subsequent
Rounds.

An AFT shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict with
this or other Rules.  An AFT that is not valid shall never be
Executed.

[The Team Competition adds an interesting new dimension, combining
cooperation with competition. The requirement to have the Players come
from different Circles makes all Players desirable to have on one’s
team.]

* 	Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Scorekeepor

	There is an Office of Scorekeepor, whose Salary is 1.5 times
the Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to keep
accurate track of the current Score of all Players. The Scorekeepor's
Report consists of the Circles of the current Round and the Players in
each Circle, the current Scores of each Player, the changes in Scores
since the last Report and the way those points were earned, the Teams
entered in the current Team Competition, and the current Team Scores
of each Team.
	The Scorekeepor is also responsible for posting the final
Scores at the end of each Round, and announcing the SPTs awarded to
the Players that have fulfilled the conditions for receiving them.

Once per Round, no more than two weeks and no less than one week
before the end of the Round, the Scorekeepor may Act to Change
the Scoring Rule Without 3 Objections. The Scorekeepor may only
propose changes to the basis of Scoring, otherwise the Action
automatically fails. If the action takes effect, the Scoring Rule
is changed appropriately at the beginning of the next Round.

[Basic stuff. Of course, the Scoring Rule can be changed in
conventional ways, but I felt it was good to have a way of easily
making changes between Rounds. Question: Should the Scorekeepor be a
competitor in the GAT?).]

*	Create a Rule with the following text:

Scoring:

	Players receive Points when certain actions are performed by
them or when certain events occur. This is the only Rule which may
define the methods of Scoring. In general, a Player may receive points
only for actions which occur during the current Round, although those
actions may depend on others which occurred previously (thus, for
example, a Player could gain points for one of eir Proposals passing,
even if the Proposal was distributed before the beginning of the
current Round.). Points are non-transferable.

	In general, a Player may receive points for a certain type of
event any number of times, unless that event has a number (N) after
it, in which case a given Player may be awarded points for that type
of event only N times in a given Round.

	If not otherwise noted, Points awarded for events referring to
"a Player" or "any Player", go to that Player. Bonuses are in addition
to the basic award. Multipliers are in lieu of the basic award.
Bonuses can be multiplied.

Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from the
following events is the responsibility of the Scorekeepor:

If a Proposal proposed by a Player passes: 5 points for first passing
Proposal by that Player in that Round, 3 for second, 1 for third, 0.5
for fourth and subsequent Proposals, +0.5 if Proposal is a Repeal, +1
if the Proposer does not Vote on the Proposal. Double points if
Proposal passes unanimously. Triple Points if the Player making the
Proposal is the only Entity who votes AGAINST.

To any Player winning a contested Election: 8 points. Double points if
Elected unanimously.

To any Player holding the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 5 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player tied for the most of a given currency at the end of a
Round: 2 Points per currency. Tripled if at any point during the Round
a Player had no holdings in that Currency.

To any Player holding no Currency whatsoever at the end of a Round: 2
Points.

To any Player earning no Blots during a Round: 4 Points.

To any Player having no Blots at the end of a Round: 6 Points.

To any Player who Voted on a Proposal, if the Final Vote Tally the
difference between the number of For Votes and the number of Against
Votes is 2 or less: 1 Point. If 6 or more: 1 Point.


	Responsibility for detecting changes to a Player's Score from
the following events is the responsibility of the Player scoring the
Points. Changes must be reported to the Scorekeepor or the Public
Forum.

If a Rule is created containing a Player's name in the text: 15
Points.

If a Player gains a Patent Title (other than SPTs or Degrees): 4
Points (1)

To any Player receiving a Degree: 4 Points for am A.N., 6 points for a
B.N., 8 Points for a M.N., and 12 Points for a D.N.Phil or a D.N.Hist.

If a Proposal made by a Player successfully creates a Rule with a
number that is a multiple of 23: 4 Points.

If a Player submits a Proposal to the Queue that is subsequently
discarded: 5 Points (1).

To any Player Proposing an Insane Proposal for which no Entity votes
FOR: 20 Points.

To any Player who is chided for posting a single document that is not
an Official Report to a forum other than the Public Forum by more than
one Player (other than themselves): 2 Points (1).

To the third Player other than the Poster making substantive comments
to a protoproposal: 1 Point (3).

To the Player making a COE that is Responded to and admitted by the
relevant Officer (other than themselves): 1 Point (1).

To the Player Holding an Office for at least one month during the
Round, and issuing at least one Official Report: 2 Points (1)

To the Player Voting or declaring Presence on all Proposals of a
single distribution: 0.5 Points.

To the Player making a Sane Proposal for which a Non-Player Voting
Entity successfully Votes: 10 points (1).

To the Player making a Senate Proposal for which a non-Senator
successfully Votes: 20 points (1).

To any Player submitting a Judgment for a CFJ which is not Appealed
before the end of the Round: 1 point.

To the Player making a CFJ which is not Judged for one month from its
original assignment: 5 Points (1 per Player per CFJ).

When an Appeal successfully overturns a Judgment, to the Players
calling for that Appeal: 2 Points

When an Appeal fails to overturn a Judgment, to the Judge who made the
original Judgment on that CFJ: 4 Points.

If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED (in any
order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 10 Points.

When a Player is Deregistered due to Silence, to the Player last
making em Silent: 3 Points.

To the Player successfully Calling for a Revolt: 10 Points.


[Any scoring system, both in the assignment of point values to actions
and in the selection of actions themselves will be arbitrary. I sought
to have a large number of scoring actions, of various levels of
difficulty. I am open to suggestions for other scoring methods.]

*	Create a Rule with the following Text:

Scoring Patent Titles

	Scoring Patent Titles (SPTs) are a subclass of Patent Titles.
They are identical to Patent Titles except that they are automatically
revoked at the end of the Round subsequent to the one for which they
were awarded. The valid SPTs, and the circumstances for which they are
awarded, are as follows:

For winning an Individual Competition in the Nth Circle, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Victor of the Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced
by the ordinal corresponding to eir Circle number). If a Player wins
the same Circle two Rounds in succession e receives instead the SPT of
'Double Victor of the Nth Circle', for three consecutive Rounds
'Triple Victor of the Nth Circle', etc.

If two or more Players within a Circle are tied for the highest score
in a Circle at the end of a Round, they receive the SPT of
'Pseudo-Victor Nth Circle' (where Nth is replaced by the ordinal
corresponding to eir Circle number).

For being a member of a Team winning the Team Competition, a Player
receives the SPT of 'Team Victor', except for the Team Captain who
receives the SPT of "Victorious Leader"

If two or more Teams are tied for the highest Team Score at the end
of a Round, their members receive the SPT of 'Pseudo-Team Victor'

If a Player Scores enough in a Round that e would have won at least
one of the Circles higher than that in which e competed, e receives
the SPT of 'Overachiever'.

If a Player Scores so low that e would have placed last in at least
one of the Circles below eir own e receives the SPT of 'Slacker'.

[This replaces the current Champion PTs]

* Rule 755 'Champions' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1465 'Champion's Reward' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1498 'Winning by Blots' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1580 'Multiple Winners of a Single Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1622 'Forfeiting the Game' is hereby Repealed.

* Rule 1697 'Multiple rapid wins prohibited' is hereby Repealed.

[Clearing out the detritus of the old system. 112 is left alone for
now since repealing it now would give this Proposal an AI of 3. I
think it is best if 1638 stay as long as 112 is still on the books,
although it is irrelvant to the GAT.]

* Rule 1764 'Public Voting' is hereby Repealed.

[A fine Rule, but I like my scoring system for Proposals, which would
be undercut by this Rule. Any Proposal bookie system also benefits by
eliminating this Rule. I hope Steve doesn’t hold this against this
Proposal.]

* Amend Rule 1435  'Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate'
by removing the last sentence "It is a Win-Preventing condition for a
Player to have one or more Blots."

* Amend Rule 1729 'Insanity' by replacing the last two lines with:

And should it occur (oh, need I say more?)
that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Score.

[Needed to complete the installation of the new system.]

Vlad, could you summarise how this proposal is different from all the
points systems that have come and gone before it? The only new additions
seem to be the Circles and the Teams (which are optional?). Why do you
think these additions will make points more attractive than they have 
been in the past?

Hsm... Steve might not, but I do. I have a proposal in the pipeline
to amend 1764. I'd rather it was not repealed as soon as it comes
into effect.

PS: Welcome back, Vlad. Sorry my first message to you should be so

What does the Order do that it can't do as a private association of
Players organized under Rule 1742?  (Please don't say Vote.  I can't
remember the last time a Group Voted.)

This is the sort of thing I'd rather see as a Contest than written into
the Rules.

Contests, I think, are useful to have in the Rules even if rarely
used.  And there *has* been a proto-contest floating around lately.

The Order of the Evil Eye voted on proposals 3816 and 3817, at the end 
of last month. The vote on 3816 was 11 FOR to 8 AGAINST, with the Order
voting FOR twice. So its vote was not quite critical, but close to it.
3816 was my proposal to deregulate Judge selection. I jumped ship from
the Threat to the Order with the particular intent to make this happen.

As I said - just because the Threat no longer has a unified political 
agenda, that doesn't mean that other Groups don't. 

Of course, you may take this as further evidence that Groups should be
repealed, but don't expect us to stand by and let that happen.

Contests can be entirely implemented using Rule 1742.
