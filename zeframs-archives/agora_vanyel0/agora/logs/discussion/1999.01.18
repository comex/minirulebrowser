General, 

If you are going to continue numbering proposals in the queue, I think
it would be more useful for the text of the proposals to be listed in
numerical order, rather than in Queue order. What do others think?

Interesting... I thought Rule 1755 said something like this, but reading it
over it indeed does not.

> 50   RPPO 4 04Jan99 08:30:51     1 The Bank        Peekee        Andre

I thought I had already satisfied this PO, but it seems that I gave the
wrong name for the Payment Order. So once again:

Acting as Chancellor, I hereby issue a Payment Order for the amount of
1 Proposal Note, to be transferred from the Bank to Peekee, to satisfy
payment order RPPO 4.

I suppose one could interpret your message of 14 January as a Proposal 
submission.  I've inserted it into the queue.

Maybe not yet, but if you make any transfer with it, the transfer will
probably work, because the Transfer Order that gave it to you will be
executed first.

Yes.

The Payment Order that ordered me as the Chancellor to send it to you
got automatically vacated when the budget was implemented. In other words:
There aren't any of those any more...

They're gone.  That order was vacated when Crito implemented his

I can sort them in practically any order people want.  I used queue
order because it seemed to make the most sense.

I suppose one could interpret your message of 14 January as a Proposal 
submission.  I've inserted it into the queue.
<<

I disagree that Morendil's (re-)post of the proposal was a
submission. The post contained the text of the proposal marked clearly
as a quotation of an earlier email document, and the intent of the
post containing the proposal text was to provide evidence that the
proposal had been properly submitted earlier. So I do not think the
text posted by Morendil was delivered "with the clear indication that
that text is intended to become a Proposal", and therefore it was not
a proposal as defined in R1483.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 3]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:
| 
|     (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
|         regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
|         such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
|         for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
|         dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
|         the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
|         disputed determination.)
| 
|     (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
|         to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
|         specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

Here's a fairly radical, but hopefully interesting idea I had this
morning. Two of the major ways in which Players can affect the course of
the game are by making Proposals and voting on them. (A third way is by
exercising powers granted to Officers and their kin.) Why not make
Players choose between them?

The idea would be to have a Proposal-making group of Players, which
would have the right to submit Proposals but not to vote on them, and a
voting group of Players, which would have the right to vote on
Proposals, but not to submit them. Each Player could belong to at most
one of these groups. I also think it would be interesting to provide
that when a Player commmits emself to one of these groups, e does so for
a fixed period of time, say 2 months, during which e may not change eir
allegiance. A further idea is to restrict the size of the Proposal-
making group to say, 4 Players, and provide some political mechanism for
deciding who gets to be in that group (e.g., Election, Auction, etc.).

Comments?

R1755 is No Non-Player Responsibilities, and I don't see the connection.

Well, no wonder Andre didn't find it then.

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 4]

Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

|     (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
|         Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
|         is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

If you mean P3823 and P3824, you'd better say so. Otherwise I cannot
count your votes.

Interesting... To what degree is that already true? How big is our 
current group of active proposers? And our group of Active Voters? And
what's the overlap? Do we have the numbers to do this?

It would add an interesting dynamic to Groups. A Group would presumably
try to have one proposer and a number of voters. You could also have
freelance proposers who will propose stuff for anybody - for a price.

The more I think about it, the more I like it. I think a group of 4
Proposers would be about right, with some kind of performance requirement
to keep them there. If they don't keep up, then they lose their status,
and can be replaced by other members of the Voting class (by Election
or Auction).

A good idea. I'd be happy to support it.

I thought somebody had suggested it before, but I couldn't remember
who.

I finally got around to reading through this proposal completely. 
Insofar as I understand it (you still go in for more legal mumbo-jumbo
than I like, Scott), I think it looks good, but I am disappointed at
the loss of the Persistent Indebtedness Infraction. It appears that
the only penalty for overdue debt is set by the paragraph below:

As I understand it, this means that the only penalty for a debt in
a given currency, is further debt in that currency. If a player does 
not care about that currency, then there is nothing to stop em from
spiralling into debt.

I would prefer that we kept the Blot penalty for overdue debt, so that
players who are in debt for an extended period have to worry about 
becoming Lawless.

Also, would it be worth having some way to allow a Judge to compel a
player to pay off excessively overdue debt, if e has the funds to do so?
Maybe that is already in there - I really didn't understand some of 
the language.

I'm not sure whether I'll support this as it stands. I'm a little uneasy
about the amount of text in there that I don't really grok. In the past
I have relied on the Rules Lawyers to interpret these things and tell
me what they mean in practice, but I am reluctant to keep doing that.
Does it really have to be so obscure?

When are you going to cease Watching and reregister, Vlad? And would you
be a Legislator or a Voter? :)
