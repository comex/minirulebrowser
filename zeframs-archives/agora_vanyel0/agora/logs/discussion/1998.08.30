My take on this is that the cases are symmetric _if_ there is a conflict,
but that there is an assymmetry in when conflict arises, in that deference
claims are intrinsically conflict-avoiding.  This does not mean that
mentioning deference is redundant in the above, as we have seen from
hypothetical examples that the conflict avoidance may sometimes fail if
two rules defer to each other in destructive ways.

I find myself tending to agree with this position.  

I'm going to be going down to the Law Library later today, and while
I'm there I'll take a look at a few treatises on Conflict of Laws to
see if anything meaningful can be gleaned from them.

I believe Steve's reading is correct.  I should note, however, that a
completely different reading would prevail were Rule 1023 to have read
"Other Rules may impose earlier times, and if so, those times, and not
those imposed by this Rule, shall apply" and "This Rule does not apply
in any situation where another Rule describes ..."  Such language
would be avoidant (or even delegatory), rather than deferent.

Sigh.  I think it's time for a complete rewrite of the entire Ruleset.

Well, I am amazed and somewhat pleased to have won the election despite
my failure to report thus far.  I think this shows that this office is
underpaid.

I have been working diligently this weekend to come up with a report by
Monday.  This looked so straight forward until I tried it.  I do not
regret taking office though, I think next weeks report will be easier,
since this one contains a months' worth of transfers!

I have no real problem with this statement.  However, I also note that
it seems quite clear to me that there is a fine line between a Rule
whose language seeks to avoid conflict and a Rule whose language
does not, but instead offers to resolve the conflict when it arises.

In the instant example, Steve gives us the hypothetical Rule-pair,
"A1: Foo is equal to 6. This Rule defers to other Rules which give Foo a
     different value." and 
"B1: Foo is equal to 5."

Steve argues that these are logically equivalent to,
"A2: Foo is equal to 6." and
"B2: Foo is equal to 5. This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which
     give Foo a different value."

This is probably true absent any other interfering Rules.  However,
consider the following, almost identical pair of Rules:
"A1: Foo is equal to 6. However, this Rule shall have no effect if
     another Rule would give Foo a different value." and 
"B1: Foo is equal to 5."

I would argue that in this case, A1 makes no claim about Foo's value
because of its conflict-avoiding mechanism, there is no conflict, and
Foo's value is 5 solely because of B1.  The conflict resolution
mechanisms are not invoked.
