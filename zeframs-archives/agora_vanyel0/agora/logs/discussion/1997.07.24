Sympathy from this quarter. I'd prefer just to talk about properties.

I don't think that observation is either trivial or uninteresting in a
context in which some people are arguing that Voting Tokens are mathemtical
entities, not physical entities, and that their distributions among the
Players can be changed directly by the Rules, without any need for
Player intervention.

I have already agreed that poker chips and numbers in files are
different in many ways, and I thank you for focussing my attention
on the differences, since it is indeed possible that these differences
may turn out to be significant in various ways. But in precisely
what ways is not yet clear to me, and I don't think you've yet said
anything which shows how the differences get to be significant insofar
as the points I've been trying to make are concerned. My main concern
has been to emphasize that, ultimately, some physical action must be
taken by a person in order to change the distribution of currencies
in either Monopoly or Agora, and that point does not seem to be affected
by the various disanalogies that exist betwen poker chips, plastic 
money and numbers in files. It's worth making explicit here the 
connection I see between this point and Scott's Jurism: the rules of
any game govern player actions, no matter what language they use to
express this fact, since ultimately everything that happens in a game
is going to have be recorded in some fashion, and recording is something
the players are going to have to do.

It can be difficult, true, but actually, it usually isn't. But in any
case, I don't really see what the difficulty has to do with anything.
In Agora, it can be difficult to tell which physical actions
constitute legal manipulations of physical entities because Agora is
a highly complex, evolving game, with fluid notions of legality. But
that has nothing to do particularly with Agora's being an email based
game. Hard core wargamers playing hugely complicated game scenarios
on large maps also often have a hard time telling which moves are legal
and which are not. It seems clear to me, though, that just as standing
around shouting silly things ain't gonna move no poker chips, sitting
around posting silly messages ain't gonna edit no files. And my point
is that it's the files where all the action is.

PS: could I request of you that you post your messages in 70-character
wide format? Whenever I quote one of your messages, which are in 80-
character wide format, the extra quote-marking character causes
spillover, and I have to reformat the quoted part of the message, which
is a bit tedious.

They fit the pattern. R1577 assigns to each Currency the property
of having an MUQ.

And sitting around sending messages isn't going to change the bit
patterns on my disk that comprise the EV records, either.  Those
records are quite impervious to the sending of messages.  At least, I
hope so.  It's theoretically possible that a software failure could
cause one of those messages to be written over a portion of the EV
records. :)

Laurent> Whereas _all_ manipulations of physical entities that
Laurent> are relevant to our playing Agora consist of sending messages
Laurent> of one sort or another,

I profoundly disagree with this statement.  A great deal of the time I
spend doing Official tasks is spent maintaining the various records I
am required to maintain.  I am not sending messages while I do this,
but I am most definitely modifying physical entities (specifically,
magnetic domain patterns encoded in particles of ferrous metal
attached to a whirling aluminum disk) when I do this.  Sometimes I
even write out parts of these records onto one of the dozens of
notepads I have floating around my desk.  But, in all of these
activities, I send no messages, at least not in the sense that I
believe you mean.  Once I finish with my recordkeeping tasks, yes, I
might indeed send off a message or two, but the recordkeeping task is
distinct and separate from the message-sending task.

Perhaps a better analogy would relate one of the myriad of games in
which scores is tabulated on a scoresheet either by one of the players
or by a neutral party.  Bridge comes to mind, but there are, of
course, many others.  I seem to recall that bridge (which has rules
for just about everything, of course) includes rules regarding how and
when the score record can be challenged, although I don't recall what
they are.  It has been my experience that, almost without fail, when
such rules exist at all, they state that the scorekeeper's record is
considered correct unless a timely challenge is made and won; and if
no timely challenge is made, the scorekeeper's record becomes regarded
as correct, all future challenges notwithstanding.  When there are no
rules, the players tend to establish informal agreements about such
things over time as it becomes necessary to do so.

Or possibly some non-player participant; but that participant is still
bound by the rules of that game, if only by being charged to "maintain
an accurate record of what happens."

This performs automatic destruction and creation of Currencies.  I

And here I am confused again (no surprise).  I thought others had noted that 
specific instances of classes of entities do not have names (agreement), but I 
must have missed other's arguments that the class itself does not have a name. 
It seems a natural and common sense interpretation to me that R1596 defines a 
class of entities and giving that class the name "Payment Orders".  I suppose
there is nothing illogical or contradictory in claiming that the class also has
no name, but it does not seem common-sensical to me.  "What class were you
talking about?" "Payment Orders."  I don't think it works to claim that
"Payment Orders" is merely an appelation by which the class is known.  The
class itself is a specific and unique instance, so an appelation which uniquely
identifies is it's name (or one of it's names).  It is true that we use the
class name to refer to instances of that class which have no unique identities
of their own.

>I am not particularily bothered by the fact that a Payment Order (the

>Stranger things have happened.

I'm not bothered by this either.  However, if both the class Payment Orders
(the currency) and the class Payment Orders (as defined by R1596) are distinct
entities, as has been successfully argued IMO, but both of them are Nomic
Entities, then R1586 would prevent the provisions of the PC proposal that
define Payment Orders and Transfer Orders from taking effect due to the name
conflict.  You can get out of this by either claiming that "Payment Orders" is
not the name of one (or both) of these entities or by claiming that one (or
both) of them is not a Nomic Entity.

I wonder if Scott would object to a refinement of my original suggestion along
the lines:

"At the beginning of the Nomic Week, the Herald shall compute the surplus of
Indulgences equal to one plus the number of Indulgences minus the number of
Blots.  If this surplus is greater than zero, the Herald shall require the Bank
to destroy a number of Indulgences equal to the surplus or the total number of
Indulgences in the Bank, whichever is less.  If this surplus is less than zero,
the Herald shall require the Bank to create a number of Indulgences equal to
the absolute value of the surplus.  At the completion of this process, the
Herald shall, for each Indulgence remaining in the Bank, pay out one Indulgence
to a randomly selected Active Player."

This accomplishes the same thing and makes the Herald responsible for creation
and destruction, rather than having it happen automatically.  Would this be
acceptable?

Not really.  Think about it:

1. Nomic Week begins.
   (up to 7 days pass)
2. Herald requires Bank to create or destroy currencies as
   appropriate.
   (up to 7 days pass)
3. Chancellor, acting for Bank, performs creation or destruction
   (up to 7 days pass)
4. Herald issues Payment Orders for all Indulgences in the Bank (at
   what time?)
   (up to 7 days pass)
5. Chancellor, acting for Bank, satisfies Payment Orders.

This process is wracked with race conditions that might arise if
Indulgences are transferred to or from the Bank in between the various
steps--not to mention what happens if the steps take more than a week
to complete: then you get multiple instances of this process running
at the same time, possibly working at cross purposes to each other.

The calculation of the distribution should, IMO, depend only on things
that the Herald can compute from eir own records, and should be based
only on the conditions in existence at the start of the Nomic Week.
This suggestion meets neither criterion.  I suspect that this
procedure could be applied without much difficulty, but I doubt
greatly that it would work the way you expect it to.

I reiterate my suggestion of basing each week's distribution on the
total amount of Payment Orders in Blots executed minus those vacated.
These represent new Blots entering the system (less Blots cancelled),
and insures a steady state relationship between Indulgences in
circulation and Blots, while also letting the Bank's Indulgence supply
float.  I don't see what the objection is (except that it's different
from what we have now, which clearly doesn't work anyway).

I tend to believe this is false, for reasons I have already outlined:
the POs of PC are not *named* Payment Orders, and thus there is
no conflict with the Currency which is named Payment Orders.  If
anyone has any other reasons why this statement would be true,
I would appreciate hearing them.  Otherwise I will deliver judgement
in a few days.

Also I would appreciate any record that people have of PC POs
which were submitted before this CFJ was made, so I can demonstrate
that it is not trivially true for that reason.

CFJ 803, which was recently reposted here (I have it if you missed
it) tends to support that the class of entities is not named
"Payment Orders".  In his arguments, Judge Michael reasoned that
a certain entity which, according to the Rules, was to be "known
as the Nomic Potato", was not *named* the Nomic Potato.  Now,
R!596 can conceivably be argued otherwise, since it uses the
term "called" rather than "known as", but I believe the same
reasoning applies.

Thanks.  I did miss that and would appreciate it if you could send me or post a
copy of that decision.  If there was only one, unique entity "known as" the
Nomic Potato I would be uncomfortable with this ruling.  What does it take to
give something a name?  To say that this can only happen if a rule says "The
name of x is..." or "x is named ..." seems a bit unreasonable to me.  But
that's just my opinion.  8)

Actually, as far as R1596 is concerned, it doesn't even use the term "called". 
It makes no direct reference to the class, it only defines the class by
describing the properties of the entities in that class.  One of these
properties is the appelation "Payment Order".  That is, every instance of this
class can be referred to as a Payment Order and collectively as Payment Orders.
I would be more comfortable with a CFJ ruling that this does not give a name to
the class than I am with the Nomic Potato ruling as I understand it from the
description above.  Still, from a common sense point of view, it seems to me
that R1596 implicitly gives the class defined in it the name Payment Orders,
because IMO any appelation that uniquely identifies an entity for reference in
speech or writing is a name of that entity.

An entity can have many appelations which uniquely identifies it (in a
given context).  Not all of these appelations are names.  Furthermore,
we generally hold that an entity has only one "true name"; other
appelations for that same entity are known as "aliases", "nicknames",
"AKAs", "fictitious names", and other such terms that clearly suggest
that such appelations are not that entity's name.  Furthermore, not

Well, in a sense they also are mathematical entities; I don't really
see how you could deny that. We _could_ in principle amend the Rules
enough to turn Agora into a purely mathematical Game, barring
registration to new Players and removing every possibility of
changing Currency holdings except by the application of 'automatic'
changes such as Salary distribution; at which point it would be
possible to derive, from the various 'axioms' that the Rules
comprise, Agoran 'theorems' relating to how many VTs can be held at a
given time by a given Player.

Are you saying that amending whichever Rule it is to change the MUQ of P-Notes 
from 1 to 0.1 would create 9 times as many P-Notes as are currently in 
existence ? Sounds strange to me...

Also the Rules don't state that individual Currency units are atomic,
they merely state that they can only be transferred atomically...

It is improper and illegal for you to record this transfer.  Only the
Chancellor, acting as the Bank's Executor, may transfer Currencies
from the Bank to another entity.  Rule 1712 requires you to issue a
Payment Order for one Indulgence from the Bank to Vanyel, but does not
in any way authorize you to execute any Transfer Orders on behalf of
the Bank.

I therefore claim that this Herald's Report is in error, in that it
reflects a transfer of Currencies which was not the result of a
legally submitted Transfer Order.

------------------------

I hereby admit this claim.  This report, and my suggestion for Indulgence/Blot
balancing were based on a deeply flawed understanding of Pragmatic Currencies. 
I see now the error of my ways - only the Chancellor is allowed to transfer,
create, or destroy currencies in the Bank.  The Rules do not give this power,
even in limited circumstances, to any other Officer.  I submit my most abject
apologies for my unbounded stupidity.  I submit a corrected version of the

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

Swanns new first paragraph of 1586:
>>    Any entity that has existence solely due to the fact that the
      Rules define it to exist, shall cease to exist whenever those
      Rules are repealed or amended to remove the definition of that 
      entity.<<

Isn't that just a tautology? Basically it says, an entity that only
exists under condition X ceases to exist when condition X ceases to
hold. So what is the information (or legal) content of the sentence? 

I admit that the old 1586, 1t paragraph, 1st sentence and 2nd
paragraph, appears to contain the same tautology. But at least there
is some additional information content of these sentences, the
definition of the term "Nomic Entity".

PROTO:Revise Nomic Entities

Let the following Rule be created:

     The name of any entity, if that name is assigned by the Rules, or 
     via procedures defined in the Rules, is a Nomic Property.  The 
     Rules may not assign two entities the same name.  If an attempt is 
     made to give entities duplicate names, only one entity is so named, 
     the other is unnamed.  The named entity is determined as follows:

      i) If both entities are named directly by the Rules, the entity 
         named by the higher precedence Rule is named.

     ii) If one entity is named directly by a Rule and the other is 
         named by some other procedure, the entity named by the Rule is 
         named.

    iii) If both entities are named by procedures other than directly 
         by a Rule, then the entity named first is the named entity.

     Classes of entities are themselves entities for the purpose of 
     this rule, and are permitted to have names.  A Players nickname is 
     a name for the purpose of this rule.  

{Comment: This finally legislates a proceedure to deal with duplicate
          names, I also think it would be better to get away from the
          idea of "Name" since IMO this restriction was origginally 
          intended to _avoid_ confusion.  I think that if the Rules call
          an entity something, that should be its name unless something
          says different.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1586 is amended to read as follows:

      Any entity that has existence solely due to the fact that the
      Rules define it to exist, shall cease to exist whenever those
      Rules are repealed or amended to remove the definition of that 
      entity.

      When the Rules defining a given entity are amended such that they
      still define the entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

{Comment: Axed the Nomic Entity idea, but kept the continuity provisions,
          which were the important part of this rule anyway.}

Sounds like a good start.  Couple of problems I see, based on recent
discussions.

1.  Looks like you will need to be more specific about what constitutes a name
and how a Rule can give something a name (or how any entity can give something
a name).  From your comments I take it you are trying to avoid the distinction
between the "one true name" and any aliases or informal appelations an entity
may have.  I don't think your formulation will avoid problems with this.

2.  I also think it may be necessary to be more specific in preventing attempts
to confuse the issue by claiming that two entities are the same because they
have been given the same name.  Even though you have language that prevents two
distinct entities from having the same name, it doesn't prevent someone from
claiming that the rule does not apply because they are not two distinct
entities.

As I write this, I am beginning to think it is better not to legislate
restrictions on names at all.  Maybe we should just specify that being referred
to by the same name is not a sufficient condition to claim that two entities
are actually one entity and enforce unambiguous referencing on pain of
ineffectiveness.

I must admit I was quite relieved that I wasn't chosen as judge on
this CFJ or its companion on TOs. But nevertheless I'd like to try and
say what reasoning I'd follow.

As far as I can tell, Morendil's Mint Manipulation (MMM) works (or at
least wants to work) like this, in chronological order:

1. A proposal is submitted that contains the definition of a new Nomic
Entity, Payment Orders. Its voting period begins.

2. Morendil creates a currency with the same name as the
not-yet-defined NE. This is also an NE.

3. The proposal passes, the sentence defining the PC-POs becomes a
rule. 

(Now comes - tadah - the crucial point; I'll first state what I think
is the interpretation that would make MMM work. Morendil - is that
roughly what you had in mind?)

According to 1586 it is impossible that two NEs have the same name, so
the sentence in the new rule that was meant to be a definition of a
new NE now becomes a sentence ascribing some new, additional
properties to the NE that already exists, the MMM-POs.

We now have one NE with one name, POs, and the properties both of the
MMM currency and the PC-PO. (This is beginning to sound like a new
generation of Star War droids, sorry bout that. And quit beeping,
R2-D2 ;)

4. What Morendil can do with this: In principle the PC scheme works,
but Morendil has the power to control it because e is the only one who
can actually make any POs. The game is not crashed, and all problems
for the game could in principle be solved if Morendil just created all
POs needed by players. So e ends up in an all-controlling position (is
that what scams are usually about?)

5. The whole scheme can also be repeated for any other proposal that
defines new NEs.


Now here is my take on what is wrong in this reasoning: it is the
interpretation of the effect of 1586 in step 3.

In fact, I think there are three ways 1586 could be seen to apply to
the situation at the beginning of step 3. They are different ways to
interpret the effect of the fact that 1586 prohibits the existence of
two NEs with the same name (I think that is all it does - it contains
some additional provisions for the case where an NE ceases to exist or
the rules defining it are amended, but this is not what we are talking
about here; note that the MMM-POs are not "defined by a rule").

a) What I described above: because they have the same name, *the two NEs
are actually one and the same NE*. And so on.

b) The new rule tries to create a new NE with the name of an already
existing NE. Therefore *the creation of PC-POs fails*, because 1586
makes the new rule, or at least its definition of POs, void.

c) The new rule creates a new NE, distinct from the MMM-POs, and tries
to name it POs. *The naming of the new NE fails*, because it violates
1586. We end up with a new and nameless NE.

Obviously I prefer interpretation c.

It may leave us in a new and unprecedented sutuation to have an
unnamed NE, but the concept of unnamed NEs even appeared in one of the
recent Protos that try to repair the NE concept.

And it avoids the attempts to say that either the MMM-POs are not NEs
or the PC-POs are not really named "POs" - two solutions which I find
rather unpleasant. They look too much like an improvised patch to
quickly cover one loophole, maybe opening up many more in the
process. And they certainly go very much against the intuitive, common
sense way in which one would normally handle things like NEs or names.

At the very least your post sounds perceptive and well researched.

Actually, I'll be content with entering a plea of guilty as charged, of Scott's
accusation that I just wanted to sow confusion in innocent minds. I'll hasten
to add that this is on my part mostly a Platonic desire to bring about a
profitable 'unlearning' of unwarranted assumptions about the workings of this
Game.

And while I'm on the subject, I've been refraining for some time to respond to
some comments that were both unkind and unenlightening with a few Kudo
transfers, because after all the position of devil's advocate has risks
associated with it that must be taken into account, but I might be less
restrained in the future.

This would be viewpoint d), then. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean 
you shouldn't acknowledge it. :)

Noting requires a TO to be submitted to satisfy a given PO _after_ that PO is
executed. According to 1732,

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order from the
      payor named in that Payment Order to the payee of that Payment
      Order for the currency and amount named in that Payment Order is
      successfully executed, provided that, when that Transfer Order
      was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated that that
      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

it only needs to be unambiguous as to which PO it is desired that such a TO 
should satisfy. Given recent debate I don't think that the objection that the 
PO it is supposed to satisfy doesn't exist at the time the TO is submitted is 
receivable. :)

It should be legal, and IMHO desirable, for one to submit a TO before the
corresponding PO is executed. OTOH, this leaves us in a sticky situation, since
the Chancellor could execute TOs from the Bank to emself or an accomplice under
the pretext that e was satisfying all POs to be submitted for, say, the next
year. Then again this would probably be liable to prosecution under TIA - we 
can't know what Currencies will still be defined in the Ruleset in two Weeks, 
so such a claim couldn't be truthfully believed. We can always protect against 
that by specifically prohibiting the Chancellor from executing proactive TOs.

And, of course, the interpretation I (and many) prefer: d) The new
rule creaates a new [class of] NEs, distinct from MMM-POs, and
makes no attempt to name them.

It is not at all unprecedented.  Consider individual P-Notes.  Does
each individual P-Note have a name?  I would argue that they do
not.

You may find the latter unpleasant, but it is supported by Game Custom.

If it was improvised, it was improvised in August 1995 when the CFJ
803 (the Nomic Potato scam) was judged.

I think it is a null action.  Note Crito's statement reads "...I hereby
pay the 1 P-Note *required for disowning a proposal* at this time."
The only reasonable way to interpret that is that he executes a
transfer order in order to satisfy the payment order generated due
to disowning a proposal.  But since the PO did not exist at the point
he posted that, it is not legal for him to satisfy that order at that time.

Changing the MUQ of P-Notes from 1 to 0.1 would cause each existing
unitary P-Note to become potentially fracturable into ten
"deci-P-Notes"; presently, P-Notes do not possess this potentiality to
fracture.  This represents a change in the properties of the units of
the currency.

I should clarify and say "the Nomic Potato Contest scam".  There
was also an entirely different (and successful) Nomic Potato scam.

An identical and simultaneous change in the property of each individual in a
class sounds very much like a change in a property of the class to me.

Speaking as a programmer, I'd implement MUQ as a static member, not an
instance member. :)

And semi-serious suggestion that nothing in the Rules requires that a TO

That makes d and e (not just d 8).  In defense of d, it is not an improvised
patch but a result of a close look at R1586.  It may go against the intuitive,
comman sense way in which one would normally handle NEs (I agree), but that is
the way R1586 defines NEs.  Note your own statement above which I underlined. 
R1586 clearly states that an NE is something that exists only due to the Rules
defining it.

Scott has made a good defense of e, which I won't repeat here.

But there are easier ways, which Blob actually mentioned. You don't *have*
to hack any files - just convince the RK (and enough of the other Players,
or perhaps just the right Players) that the transfer is legal. Fraud is
possible as well as outright theft.

Well, this whole thread started with my response to Crito that it's
harder to steal in Agora than it is in Monopoly. But you're right: as
far as I'm concerned, the difference is only one of degree of
difficulty. Metaphysically, the actions have the same description:
the illegal manipulation of the physical medium used as money.

Of course the only way to maintain the mathematical character of such
a system would be to entirely eliminate human action from it. At which
point it is not clear that the system so described deserves any longer
to be called a 'game'. It has become a mathematical theory, or a system
of equations, or some such thing. Which is precisely my point: to the
extent that actual currency holdings are *not* derivable as theorems
from a starting set of axioms plus a set of rules, or a set of initial
conditions plus some equations described by the Rules, (ie, to a very
great extent), currencies should not be regarded as mathematical entities.

The qualifier 'described by the Rules' is very important in the above.
There is a familiar sense in which the entire universe can be
described as a set of initial conditions plus some equations (the
laws of physics). Without the qualifier, someone might argue that
currency holdings can, in principle, be derived from some starting
set of initial conditions and the laws of physics, (absent worries
about quantum mechanics and chaos theory, as usual), and hence that
they are mathematical entities after all. The qualifier serves as
a reminder that this is not the sense of 'mathematical entity' that
Morendil can have intended.
