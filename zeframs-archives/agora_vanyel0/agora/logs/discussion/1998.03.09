I actually quite like being Cartographor at the moment as it makes my
job as Registrar easier.  The Registrar has to watch movement for two
reasons: i) Players can only switch their Hold status by moving, and
ii) Players can only switch their Abiding/Rebelling status by being in
the Beer Hall.

In other words, the current system is extremely badly designed because
it requires one Officer to watch over something that should be the
provenance of another. 

In any case, I'd probably be quite keen on being Cartographor come the
brave new world of Plots.

Michael.

It seems a waste of time to bother talking about unassigned, idle
Structures.  Treating Structures as things that exist even when not
deployed seems like a mistake. 

Why not something like: 

  A Player may build a Structure on a Plot that does not have any
  other Structure on it as long as this does not result in the Player
  owning more than five Plots with Structures on them.

  There are different types of Structure available, and their costs
  are as follows...

I also dislike the way that Churches have been altered so that they
represent a guaranteed supply of Indulgences.  What was wrong with the
increased chance of receiving an Indulgence in any distribution?  If
double the chance was felt not to be significant enough, why not make
it a fivefold increase?

Michael.

I also thought they were quite good as they were. Okay, so 1 church isn't
anything special, but with 3 Churches = 7 times better chance to get
Indulgences than any other player, I think you could do fairly well.
(Especially if (when) Crito's proposal to reinstate Indulgence scarcity
passes.)

Yes, I should have made it clear that my comments were made under this
assumption.  I think the "hot Potato" Blot is a great idea, one that
we also never got a chance to play with properly, and Crito's proposal
will certainly be getting a vote from me.

Whether you like it ior not, Jester, *not* voting in the Elections
was a political act, inasmuch as it had the significant political
consequences of allowing several Elections to be tied, and of forcing
Kolja to support Morendil as Justiciar (when I suspect he would have
preferred to vote for Harlequin), in order to avoid another tie.

No.  If you brought to attention and could convince everyone that your
interpretation of the Rule was correct, then "Game Custom" would not prevail. 
The Rules always prevail.  It's only when the Rules are "silent, inconsistent,
or unclear" that Game Custom is used.

To some extent, it is true that new players are at a disadvantage when it comes
to knowing how existing ambiguities in the Rules are being resolved.  But I
think this is a normal state of affairs for any Nomic, and one of the reasons
that we have the Grace Period.

I appreciate that and I hope this has been helpful.

I don't have time to respond to any particulars in
this thesis right now, but overall I would say it
is an excellent essay - one with which I agree,in
general, on a quick reading.  I applaud you Kolja.

I don't agree.  If a Rule is ambiguous, but has always been
applied in a certain way, Players should be able to reasonably
assume that it will continue to be applied in that way.

>If a Rule specifically prohibited some action,
>but for years it was ignored and a different course was taken, would

No.  GC applies only when the Rules are silent, inconsitent,
or unclear.

>discriminate against new players in that they might infer something
>from the Rules that is completely legitimate, but is then invalidated

Possibly, but I think the stability encouraged by GC outweighs
that consideration.

Proto-Proposal - Sherlock #1.2
------------------------------

[ Comment: This Proposal is written with the assumption that Risky
           Rebellion passes.  It will not be proposed until that time.
	   Thanks to Blob and Crito for significant additions to this. ]

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten
      or if another Player gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

You may have noticed that I, as a founding member(1) of Procrastinators
Anonymous, usually do my Voting during the last minute.  Trust me, I will
take care of this soon, unless some unexpected event should prevent me.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

(1) I didn't say I'd got around to founding it yet, did I?

This is still inconsistent.  It should be lost if some other Player gains
equally many Blots, as well.

It should be noted, however, that peaches are a fruit.

Utterly fascinating, but rubbish.  "Adoption Ratio" is defined in Rule
1434, "Default Procedure for Referendum Voting".  "Adoption Index" 
applies only to Proposals.

Very good question.  2nd question first:  if there was no ambiguity in the
text of the Rule, but we all simply assumed that it meant something other
than it did, a Judge realizing this would be obliged to favor the text of
the Rule over even the most long-standing Game Custom.  This has happened
at least once, when the Kudo system turned out to be invalid.

In the case where a Rule is ambiguous or unclear, we often rely on the
Courts.  A CFJ tends to bind future interpretations of the same Rules until
the Rules change.  But sometimes the unclear Rule never gets as far as a
CFJ: everybody agrees, or is at least willing to go along with the
consensus without challenging it in court.  After a time this constitutes
"Game Custom".  In a sense it ought to be even _more_ authoritative than a
CFJ, as it derives from at least consensus of all players rather than
decision of a Judge.

I take your point that new players are somewhat disadvantaged with respect
to this.  It's hard to know "the way things have always been done".  It's
also hard to know the results of earlier CFJs, but they guide play in the
same way and for the same reason:  to promote consistency over time.

Strange, but not rubbish.  I read the relevant paragraph of 1434 as
defining the "Adoption Ratio" as the ratio of FOR votes to AGAINST votes.
1434 says that this may be overridden by other Rules, so instead of this
calculation, it is set to 2.  Rule 1434 further says that the "Adoption
Ratio" must be greater than 1 to succeed.  2 is greater than 1.

Whoops.  Just utterly fascinating, then.  I note that Rule 1658 (Tainting
the Speaker) has the same problem.

I don't see why this necessarily follows.  Why wouldn't it be that they can't
pass at all? Or that they take the default AI of 1?  Of course the delegation
bug makes this a moot point anyway.

Would that have any effect?  I would read the rules to mean that when
the Referendum ends, the results take effect, not when they're
announced later.

But, I acknowledge that I might be wrong, so I'll certainly hold off
for a reasonable time if Michael does not do anything.

And, say what you might about me, my calls for Impeachment have
exposed some serious flaws in the system.

Proto-Proposal - Sherlock #1.3
------------------------------

[ Comment: This Proposal is written with the assumption that Risky
           Rebellion passes.  It will not be proposed until that time.
	   Thanks to Blob, Crito and Oerjan for significant additions 
     	   to this Proposal. ]

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscrean t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another Player
      gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked from 
      the Miscreant.

Rule 1434 contains:

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

As Jeff as has already pointed out, R1434 allows other Rules to override
its defaults. So R1486 can set the Adoption Ratio of all Impeachment
Referenda to 2, regardless of the votes cast. Since 2 is greater than
1, all such Referenda meet R1434's criteria of effectiveness as long as
they meet Quorum.

I disagree. It should work like the Shogun does (I think) - that is, you 
should have to actually overtake the Miscreant in order to take eir 
Title.

I will note, however, that the proposal still needs a precedence clause,
to make sure it has effect.

I simply disagree that the first sentence establishes a maximum number
of votes that Voting Entities may cast. It does no more than it seeks
to do, which is to establish the number of votes which Voting Entities
may cast in the normal course of events. Nowhere does it say, and nowhere
is it implied, that this constitutes any kind of maximum. Only the
second sentence established a maximum number of votes, namely 5, and it
is clearly this maximum, the only maximum established by the Rules,
to which R1766 refers.

I don't think R1660 is muddled. It only seems so to you because you
have this peculiar idea that the 2 votes granted to Voting Entities
by R206 is some kind of maximum. I see nothing in the Rules to support
any such conclusion. The 2 votes is simply not a maximum at all, just
a limit on voting in the ordinary course of events, which course can
be disrupted precisely by the operation of Rules such as R1660,
R1766, or, I might add, the old Power of Influence Rule. The 'maximum'
referred to in Rules 1660 and 1766 is plainly the 5 vote maximum
which R206 really does impose, and which really is a maximum.

"Adoption Index" is meaningless for Referenda.  Rule 1434 states
(indirectly) that a Referendum passes if its Adoption Ratio is greater
than 1, if it receives a Quorum of Votes, and if its Vote Collector
reports the result of the Referendum within seven days of the end of
its Voting Period.  Since the Adoption Ratio of all Referenda to
Impeach is locked at 2, only the latter two conditions need be met for
a Referendum to Impeach to pass.

You are correct that replacing "Adoption Ratio" with "Adoption Index"
would not achieve the desired effect; however, Steve's argument that
the Impeachment Rules are flawed is not "rubbish".

I disagree. At the current momement, if I were to vote on any 
proposals up for vote, I could make one vote or two votes, but not 
more than two votes. I can't make five votes, so that's not the 
maximum number of votes I can make. Since two is the most votes I 
could legally make, without getting some special privelege (in which 
case the number would be three or four or five) I don't currently 
have, I conclude that that is the maximum number of votes I could 
make is two.

Let me reiterate that Rule 1766 says the maximum number of votes cast 
by _the player voting_ isn't raised, as opposed to Rule 1660, which 
uses the much more general "a Player".

If the only maximum established by the rules is five, then why can't 
I make any number of votes higher than two on any given proposal? You 
seem to be trying to say that 'the maximum number of votes that are 
permitted to be cast by that Player' means something other than the 
greatest number of votes which that Player has the option of legally 
casting. If this is your argument, could you please give your 
justification? If this isn't your argument, what _is_ your argument?

If the word 'maximum' were applied to Voting in general, or voting on 
that Proposal in general, I would agree with you. However, Rule 1766 
is clearly talking about the votes made by a specific Player on a 
specific Proposal, which almost always has a different, lower 
maximum (usually two).

For those who wish to judge whether or not that is true, I present 
the full text of Rule 1766 (which was included as evidence in my 
CFJ):

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.
