As I've already argued, there is no loophole. To quote R955, "in
all other cases", the VI is the ratio of FOR/AGAINST.

Differences of degree are often significant, legally.  Legal reasoning

Hmm.  If this is true, it also means that the Promotor may distribute only
the 5 proposals that are highest in the queue, and no others.  Which means
that Kolja A.'s "Zeitgeist and scarce currencies" may not be distributed
and thus may not be voted upon.  It gets even more complicated if I ask
whether Swann's original proposal is still in the queue. What proposals
_are_ we voting on?

Actually I note that putting Proposals in the Queue is also Pragmatic, so
the only Rule breach if any would be an ASAP violation.

<<

Of course, now we have a situation which differs from the ideal you
describe: P3710 _has_ been distributed and voted on. At least speaking
pragmatically. 

Oerjan just mentioned this: it seems quite clear that we'll treat
mistakes that concern the timing of a proposal's distribution in a
pragmatic way, so distributions in the wrong order (according to the
proposal queue) would be valid, although the promotor broke a rule
(and may have to face punishment for this).

Concerning P3710, of course, the question is whether the proposal was
distributed at all, or some other document that happened to be similar
to the real (Platonic) proposal.

Morendil mentioned that the mistake in the distributed form of P3710
was only gradually different from a complete replacement of proposal's
text with something else. I wonder if this would be true if the
mistake introduced in the distributed version was only a
straightforward typo, covered by 754 - I think in the case of such a
typo we would treat the distribution of the proposal in a pragmatic
way; but in the present case we seem to be favoring a Platonic
interpretation. 

I'm not sure what result I would prefer concerning the adoption of
P3710 on aesthetic reasons (it's but a weak consolation for the
non-scamsters to see that the monument isn't quite as beautiful as it
was meant to be); but I wonder why noone has tried to argue that the
omission of a single character, which was clearly introduced
inadvertently and which doesn't throw any doubt on the meaning of the
provision, should be simply ignored. I admit that it could not be
ignored based on a literal interpretation of 754, but still...

This is not immediately clear.  Note the structure of the paragraph:

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.  The
      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

It would seem that "The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as
follows:" governs the rest of the paragraph, including the "in all other
cases" provision.  Therefore this assignment is only made after the end of
the Voting Period.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

The problem is that due to Rule 1339, the typo does _not_ have the same
meaning as the original - they cannot take effect in the same way.  This
may be enough to prevent Rule 754 from applying, even during distribution.

(Another issue is that Rule 1339 might directly apply to distributions
itself - it is not clear that the first sentence is restricted to when
the Rule Change takes effect.)


Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

Ørjan.

I would argue that with the current wording, the distribution of a
Proposal is a Pragmatic process, and therefore the Promotor's action
stands, even though e may have broken some Rules.

However, this is provided there is actually a Proposal to distribute.  As
Chuck noted, Rule 1483 defines whether something is a Proposal in a
Platonic way.

Whatever we voted on took effect IMHO.  If, for some reason, it wasn't
the proposal I submitted, I believe it may count as an implicit
Proposal submission by the Promotor-- which might have some strange
side effects, and alter the voting (Blob's votes) but I think it's the
interpretation that makes the most sense _if_ it's found that the typo
in the distrubution means that it was not the same Proposal that was
submitted. . . I am convinced that it _was_ a Proposal, and I don't
think the typo can invalidate that fact.  (It might be a different
Proposal, but it was still voted on and adopted.)

As I've already argued, you're taking "in all other cases" out

No this is not quite true.  As someone pointed out, placing proposals in the
queue is a pragmatic (ASAP) action and Steve's proposal was not put in the
queue at the time Kolja's was distributed.  It also seems that Swann's original
proposal has never been placed in the queue, although something very much like
it was.

I don't believe R1483 allows "implicit Proposal submission."
It requires that the text which is to become a proposal have a
"clear indication that the text is intended to become a Proposal."

Baby Bottles and Rule 206

IMO, Rule 206 does not establish any particular number as the maximum number of
votes that a Player may cast.  Rather it establishes a procedure that must be
used in order to determine what that number is on a case by case basis, i.e.

1.  Start at 2.
2.  Adjust up or down by applying other Rules.
3.  If results of step 2 are greater than 5, set result to 5.

I'm not really sure this rule is all that useful in interpreting R1766's last
sentence, since if you *do* use 206 as the basis for the meaning of "maximum
number of votes that are permitted to be cast by that Player", then the result
is different whether or not you include 1766 itself as part of step 2 in
interpreting 1766.  To include 1766 in step 2 seems a bit circular, but that
makes the last sentence redundant, and has the effect for which Steve argues. 
If you exclude 1766 from step 2, then, IMO, the last sentence makes the Rule
self-depriving, as Antimatter argues.

Indeed. I'm a little disappointed; I expected you to come up with a
counter-argument with a little firmer footing. We've seen a rather
alarming tendency towards interpreting Rules in rather ridiculous ways,
when a far more plausible and sensible alternative is available; this
argument, I fear, only adds fuel to the fire.

Re: Opinions sought on 3710

I can see nothing in the Rules that describes a procedure that allows the
adoption of only portions of a proposal.  R116 and R1011 explicitly prohibit
Rule changes unless carried out by the proper procedure as described in the
Rules.  Certainly R107 does not provide this procedure since it only says "If
adopted".  R1483 only describes what is a proposal.  It seems clear that
Swann's proposal was never distributed.  Something very similar was distributed
in its place, but was that a proposal?  If it wasn't, then voting on it can
have no effect on the Rules, since the Rules can only be changed by an
Instrument of the proper power, and text that is not a proposal has power = 0.

However,

R1483

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

This seems to hinge on whether the Promotor entering something of eir own into
the queue constitutes "delivering a collection of text to the Promotor...etc". 
Self-delivery of messages by Officers is an issue that has never been well
resolved in Agora, AFAICT.  I do think that entering text into the Proposal
Queue, however, can be considered a "clear indication" that the text is
intended to be a Proposal.  At the moment, it looks to me that the most
reasonable interpretation of events is that Blob failed to place Swann's
proposal into the queue and inadvertently substituted a Proposal of eir own,
which was subsequently voted upon and adopted.

I don't see how this could be true. Entering it into the queue is not
the same as delivering it to the Promotor (i.e. emself), just like
counting votes is not the same as sending them to the vote collector,
even in situations where secret voting is possible. In New
Rishonnomic, e.g., I am speaker and have to count all votes. Voting
there isn't public, but I always make sure I make up my mind on how I
will vote (and usually send a mail to myself with that effect, so I
can file that mail together with the other votes until I count them
all) before the end of the voting period, and before I count the
votes. 

The document that was, apparently wrongly, entered into the queue by
the promotor has never been communicated by anybody to anybody (before
it was distributed, of course). It has been created by the Promotor
out of the proposal submitted by Swann, but the Promotor never even
noticed that e had inadvertently changed this document, and the
document as distributed never fulfilled the requirement "with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal" of
R1483.

The question, for me, is whether creating this erroneous document is equivalent
to communicating it to emself.  I don't think your vote counting analogy
applies here.  The problem with "clear indication" is that the erroneous text
contains exactly the same indication that it is intended to be a proposal as
any other proposal that I have ever seen submitted.  The only difference is
that the "indication" is not backed up by the Player's actual intent.  But we
seldom give weight to actual intent.

Suppose I were to publish the queue with a proposal of my own that I had never
sent to the PF and had not e-mailed to myself in any way.  Would this not be a
proposal?  What are the actual requirements for an Officer to communicate with
emself?  How aware does an Officer have to be of a communication for it to
count as a communication?  If you sent me something that requires action by the
Promotor and I do not notice it, it still has full legal force.  Why wouldn't
the same be true for an Officer inadvertently communicating something to emself
without realizing it?

Intent may not count, but _evidence_ of intent does - that is exactly what
"clear indication" means in this case.

In particular, any message you communicate to yourself claiming to be an
already submitted Proposal from Swann doesn't contain a clear indication
of being intended to become a Proposal - it contains a clear indication of
already being one.

I am thinking that Rule 1483 would be better with a "thereby" between "is" 
and "intended".

The issue of Officers communicating with themselves is a can of worms,
anyhow.  What if you made a Proposal submission in your sleep?

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Right. 8)  Even more practicaly, what about a document that the Promotor
prepares as a proposal that e is thinking about submitting but has no intention
of doing so (at that moment)?  It seems intention has to be counted somehow
here.  Sending it to the PF or in a formal e-mail to oneself is clear evidence
of intent, but I think placing it in the queue is also sufficient evidence,
which may make *anything* the Promotor places in the queue automatically a
proposal, unless it is clearly marked as *not* being one.  It certainly *is* a
thorny issue.  8)

That's a plausible reading, I suppose. Nevertheless, I still don't
think that Chuck's Proposal can set the VI of another Proposal to 6
without conflicting with R955, however. Chuck's Proposal does nothing
to stop R955 from working. Therefore, at the end of the VP of CVSII,
it will have, via R955, a Voting Index determined by the votes cast
on it. If the Rule created by CVSI says that CVSII has a VI of 6,
well, that's just a straight conflict with R955.

However, if we were to interpret R1339 so that distributions of Proposals
which contained vague or ambiguous Rule Changes were void and without
effect, then R1339 would be in direct conflict with R404, which prohibits
making the legality of making Proposals (which in my view includes
distributing them for the purposes of R404), conditional upon the content
of the Proposal. At any rate, it is enough to note that game custom
is clear on this point: we never have interpreted R1339 in this way
before, and we have allowed many Proposals containing imprecisely
specified Rule Changes to be distributed.

I think you're right that actual intent of the Proposer is irrelevant.
We can see that by considering my near-miss Proposal last week. I
accidentally sent a document to a-b, with "Proposal" in the Subject
line. The only thing which prevented this from becoming a Proposal
was that the text of the document indicated that it a Proto-Proposal
only, and not a Proposal. But now, imagine that the text of the document
had indicated that document was a Proposal. Then I would certainly have
had to accept that I submitted a Proposal, notwithstanding that my
intention had not been to do so. This would be equally true if I were
the Promotor, which seems to bring us precisely to the situation with
respect to Promotor Blob and Proposal 3710* (I use the '*' to
indicate the text distributed by Blob).

Don't you think that word 'Proposal', appearing at the top of the
document, is a clear indication that the document is intended to be
a Proposal?

I think I'm coming to the view elaborated by Crito that we should
regard the Proposal distributed by Blob as a genuine Proposal
submitted by Blob, with Swann's Proposal mistakenly not having
been placed in the Queue yet, where presumably it still remains.

I note Rule 106:

Rule 106/0 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.

Now, a Proposal's being adopted is not the same as its taking effect,
but I would have thought that the former was a necessary condition
for the latter. If it is, then the provisions of P3716 cannot have
the effect of making the provisions of CVSII effective before the VP
of CVSII concludes, since this would conflict with R106.

But perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps the provisions in a Proposal can take
effect without that Proposal being adopted. What then? Well, first
notice R594:

      When a Proposal is *adopted*, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index... (emphasis added)

Since we're considering the case in which CVSII has not been adopted,
then we must conclude that in this case, R594 does not grant CVSII a
Power equal to its Adoption Index, which is 5. It seems to me that 
there are two possibilities in that case. Either the Proposal has a
Power of zero, in which case it can have no effect, or (more likely)
it is 1, in which case it cannot have the effect of repealing 'A
Monument to the Threat', nor create the Power 3 Rule Chuck would have
it create. The only effect it can have to grant all non-Threats a
win. But who wants to win that way? Anyone can make a Proposal which
says "The following 12 Players all win the game."

Summarizing: if P3716 is supposed to make it the case that CVSII is
adopted as soon as P3716 is adopted, then it runs afoul of R106. On
the other hand, if P3716 is supposed merely to make CVSII take effect,
without being adopted, when P3716 is adopted, then CVSII cannot have
a Power > 1, and so will be ineffective, at least in countering the
scam.

I think you have me here.  Don't know how I missed that.

But you do you think CVSII would have a Power of 1?  Given this
line of reasoning, I think it would be zero.  (Cf. R1688)

But I still don't think there *was* a scam.  I don't think
the distribution of P3710* (thanks for the terminology) is
a "clear indication that the text is intended to *become*
a Proposal." (emphasis mine)

I think the way I put things above was more than a little misleading.
Here's how my reasoning went: if P3716 is adopted, then it becomes an
instrument of Power 1, and its provisions take effect. Now, those
provisions happen to say that another Proposal, CVSII, has a Voting
Index of 6, and that the provisions of that Proposal take effect
immediately. You've accepted my argument P3716 cannot have the effect
of giving CVSII a Power of 5 (even if its Voting Index is 6). And I
think you are correct that CVSII, at the time that P3716 is adopted,
has a Power of zero, in accordance with R1688. Nevertheless, there
remains the adopted Proposal 3716, which is an instrument of Power=1,
and which says that the provisions of CVSII take effect immediately.
One of those provisions, for example, is to create the Rule "A Win
for non-Threat". By R1690, the Power of a new Rule is 1, and by
R1322, an instrument of Power 1 is required to create this Rule. But
P3716, if adopted, is such an instrument, and so it can create the
Rule "A Win for non-Threat", even though it can't repeal "A Monument
to the Threat" or create the Power=3 instrument loophole closing Rule.

Essentially, in my view, the use of a Proposal such as CVSII to frame
the provisions to which P3716 indirectly refers is irrelevant. The
provisions could, with the same effect, have been collected in
"Chuck's Weird Provision Collection", a document of your own devising,
although in the absence of any controls concerning the content of
such a document, obviously Players would be mad to vote to adopt a
Proposal which said "Upon the passage of this Proposal, the
provisions specified in the document entitled "Chuck's Weird
Provision Collection" shall take effect". Nevertheless, if they did
vote to adopt it, the provisions in CWPC would take effect, provided
the Power of the Proposal was sufficient.

All of this, note well, depends on allowing a liberal reading of
R1322, so that the instrument which specifies a Rule Change is allowed
to do so indirectly. If that is not allowed, then none of the Rule
Changes in CVSII can take effect.

I agree with you here. It's a good thing, then, that by the time the VP on

To be excessively literal, I too did not vote against 3710 :-). Of 
course, that wasn't _my_ idea.

Rule 1766 states that 'This shall not increase...', which indicates 
that Rule 1766 cannot raise the maximum above what it would be 
without Rule 1766. Unless there's some new definition of 'increase' 
I'm not familiar with :-)

Of course, that isn't Steve's argument. The whole thing pivots on the 
definition of 'maximum', and particularly the set of things for 
which the maximum is being found. I say it's the number of votes 
which can be made by the Player given extra votes by Rule 1766 
(which, IMO, is definitiely supported by that Rule) on the Proposal 
the extra votes are given on, without taking into account the effect 
of Rule 1766 [Which, of course, is nothing]. Steve (correct me if I'm 
wrong) considers the set to be the number of Votes which may be cast 
by that Player in some not-clearly-defined set of hypothetical 
worlds.
