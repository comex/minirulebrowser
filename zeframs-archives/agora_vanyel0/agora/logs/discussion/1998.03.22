I find this interpretation absurd. Rule 1766 clearly says that it 
doesn't increase the number of votes; to determine if it increases 
it, the only way to go is to look at the number of votes before Rule 
1766 takes effect, and afterwards, and compare them.

I think that game custom is for provisions within a rule that 
refer to other provisions within that rule to have precedence over 
the other provisions. For example, the Virus Text.

I find plenty of evidence in Game Custom that, when a later provision 
in a rule says it overrides or modifies the effect of an earlier 
provision, the later provision has precedence. See Rules 1030, 1755, 
and 452, and the old Viral Text for examples.

Steve, would you mind telling me what your answer your interpretation 
gives in the following hypothetical situations?

A] A rule says 'No player may have more than three moogs.' What is the
maximum number of moogs a player can have, given no other information
about the player?

B] Same as [A], but a higher-power rule says 'The Speaker may have up
to five moogs.' What is the maximum number of moogs a player can have,
with no extra information? What is the maximum number of moogs a
player other than the Speaker can have?

C] Same as [A], but a higher-power rule says 'The Speaker may have up
to five moogs iff it is a Tuesday.' What is the maximum number of
moogs a player can have if the day is unknown? On a Tuesday? On a
Friday?

D] Same as [A], but another rule will replace the 'three' in the first
rule with 'five' in one day. The maximum number of moogs a player can
have is?

E] Same as [D], but in one year instead of one day. The maximum 
numbef of  moogs a player can have is?

For reference, here are my interpretation's answers:
A] Three
B] Five; three
C] Five; five; three
D] Three
E] Three

Okay, you're right those aren't sets. Take two.

I say that Rule 1766 cannot increase the maximum of the set of 
numbers which could legally be the number of votes cast by the player 
in question on the proposal in question if e cast those votes at the 
time the maximum was being determined.

I _believe_ your argument to be that Rule 1766 cannot increase the 
maximum of the set of numbers which could legally be the number of 
votes cast by the player in question on any member of the set of 
proposals up for vote in any member of a subset, X, of the set of all 
possible hypothetical future worlds.

I just don't know what X is. It's not just the real, current world, 
because that would give a number very close to my number, differing 
only when the player could cast extra votes on some but not all of 
the proposals up for vote [I don't even want to think of how two Rule 
1766 proposals would work]. It's not all possible hypothetical 
future worlds, because that gives you aleph-null numbers which could 
legally be the number of votes cast, and the maximum of that is not 
5. So my question is, what is X?

I would like to see the evidence which supports the view that this is 
how R206 works.

I'm not sure I follow. Rule 1766 doesn't care about the maximum 
voting privilege the player can have, it's concerned with the maximum 
number of votes the player can cast.

That's an interesting way of putting it [Rule 1766]. I'd say that, 
perhaps, this fact gives you 'draw odds': if both interpretations are 
equally possible, then yours should be the one we use, since its 
results are more sensible. However, if your interpretation is 
signifigantly less plausible then mine, the result in the way Rule 
1766 is applied is not relevant in determining the correct 
interpretation.

That I disagree with. What is 'absolutely forced'? It's reasonable to 
say that we must have been 'absolutely forced' to make the 
interpretations that have led to all past rule-crises, right?

You're saying (I _hope_ you're saying) that the results of your 
interpretation are more sensible than the results of my 
interpretation. You're probably right. However, I can't figure out 
how to generalize your interpretation to other, similar 
interpretations; and since I can't do that, it isn't clear to me that 
it makes sense.

Not to the PF.  This CFJ is still one call short of being appealed.

In response to someone who asserted (sorry, I deleted the original)
that there is a game custom that when a Rule conflicts with itself,
the latter of the two conflicting provisions take precedence:

I would argue that there are several such cases, because that
is a frequent and natural way of phrasing things.  I don't necessarily
think  that that can be extended to all possible cases of self-conflicting
Rules.

In other words, if the natural reading of a self-conflicting Rule
is that the latter provision takes precedence, that's fine.  But
the fact that there are several such Rules should not be extrapolated
to mean that the latter provision of a self-conflicting Rule
takes precedence, when natural usage does *not* support such
a precedence.

Thankyou, Chuck, you took the words right out of my mouth. Chuck
is here restating the conclusions we came to at the end of a long
debate some time ago as to whether or not we should legislate on
how to deal with self-contradictory Rules. We concluded that we
should not legislate on this subject. Dealing with self-contradictory
Rules requires a lot of flexibility, and as soon as you try to
say in advance how they should be treated (eg by having a Rule
which says "when two provisions in a Rule conflict with each, the
latter takes precedence"), you've given up some of that flexibility.

No conclusions should be drawn from the Virus, by the way, particularly
not from the fact that the Viral sentence always appeared at the end
of the Rule. That's just a historical accident; the Virus could just as
well have operated by prepending the Viral sentence at the top of the
Rule rather than appending it to the bottom.

I find that agree with Chuck's proposed handling of self-conflict far
more than I do with that proposed by Antimatter.

Then why do we legislate the resolution of conflicts between different
Rules?  Could we not elect to resolve those conflicts in the natural
manner, just as you have proposed here for resolving conflicts within
a Rule?

We could - except that conflicts between different Rules are so much
more common than conflicts between provisions in a single Rule that
the need for the flexibility which allows for resolutions in a natural
manner, as you put it, is outweighed by the need for quick resolutions
of those conflicts. Compare the fraction of a second that it takes me
to determine that R402 takes precedence over R1660, with the weeks it
might easily take me to extract a specific determination in this matter
from the courts. In the case of self-contradictory Rules, their
occurrence is infrequent enough, and their interpretation ticky enough,
to warrant spending the extra time.
