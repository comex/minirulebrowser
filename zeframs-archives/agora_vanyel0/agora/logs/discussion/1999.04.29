The last batch was distributed last Monday. The next batch is due to be
distributed before the end of this week, so Michael still has a fair 
amount of time. I think he said he would do it today sometime.

I doubt that many others would vote for such an amendment, but I do see
your point. :)

This has a number of problems, I'm afraid:

The first is that it will not do what you want. Rule 107 has power 3, so
you'll need a proposal with Adoption Index 3 or more to amend it. AIs 
have to be set when the Proposal is made, or else they default to 1. 
(See Rule 594)

Secondly, Rule 1483 already requires that Proposals go to the Public 
Forum. Isn't that good enough?

Thirdly, there's not much point in putting such a condition in a high
power rule, when the definition of "Public Forum" is in a much lower
powered rule. If I wanted to get around your restriction, I could just 
amend Rule 478 to say that imagining something in my head is equivalent
to sending it to the PF. So your proposal actually weakens R107, by
making it rely on concepts defined in lesser rules.

If I remember rightly, you proto'd this earlier. I'm sorry I didn't
point out these bugs before it got to this stage.

Maybe I misremember, but I thought you were firmly on the side of the "platonists"
in those days when we were having our "platonist/pragmatist" discussions.

It is this last sentence where you lose me.  If you said "the entire context
*should* be considered",  then we would not be that far apart in our
positions - I 'm just searching for a justification as to how this particular
Rule supports considering the entire context.  But when you say "the entire
context *must* be considered", then I have trouble, because it seems
you are saying that it needs no justification, that it is self-evident in the
definition of "clear".

I don't think the definition helps that much.  What you have just shown,
IMO, is that given a comprehensive list of possibilities for the definition
of a word, you can pick and choose what you need from it to
support any reasonable interpretation.  It is clear 8) from the above
list, that any interpretation of "clear" does not have to meet
*all* of the above possibilities.  You choose 6d, "free from obstruction",
to support your contention that the entire context must be used.
Steve uses only 3c, "easily understood", to support eir contention
that the imbedded indication was "clear".  Both choices are
reasonable, but there is still nothing there to tell us which one
is the more correct one.

I honestly am sympathetic to your interpretation, but it still seems more
like a coin toss to me.

You have chosen an example which causes our very humanity to cry out
for your interpretation of "clear".  Who among us (besides lawyers) could
be so heartless as to deny that the drug company bore a responsibility not
only to make the wording clear but also to make sure the words would be
easily perceived?

/melodrama off

But this is not such a life and death situation.  Does "indication" in R1483
refer only to the words themselves or to the entire message in which the
words are written?  The problem here is that you could easily substitute
the words "clear wording" for "the clear indication" into R1483.  So while
I recognize that there *can* be more to a clear indication than clear
wording, I'm still not convinced that there is more to it in this particular
case.

I think a good case could be made for the "entire message" possibility
here simply on the grounds that this is the basic "unit of
communication" we use when we communicate with each other over this
medium.

Hmm.  I'm not so sure.  We certainly have a lot of examples of multiple
tasks being performed within one message, so the "basic unit" could

Now simplified due to Murphy (Thanks Murphy).

Protoposal,  "The Treasuror" 


Create a rule titled "The Treasuror" with the following text

There exists the office of Treasuror.

As soon as possible after the beginning of the quarter, the Registrar 
shall initiate an Election for Treasuror.  The Office of Treasuror 
shall only be elected at the time specified by this Rule, Rules to the 
contrary notwithstanding.

Each Nominee for Treasuror shall submit a valid Protobudget by the end 
of the Nomination Period, else their Nomination is automatically 
withdrawn.

A valid Protobudget must contain all information that the Treasuror's 
Budget is required to contain.

If a Nominee submits multiple Protobudgets during the Nomination 
Period, only the last one is considered.

When the Vote Collector announces the Candidates for the office of 
Treasuror to the Public forum at the end of the voting period, e shall 
also list the last valid Protobudget posted by each Candidate.

As soon as possible after the election of a Nominee to the office of 
Treasuror the Nominee's Protobudget becomes the Treasuror's budget, 
and shall be posted to a public forum again by the Treasuror.

If there are no candidates for the office of Treasuror or no one is 
elected to the office of Treasuror.  The Treasuror's budget shall 
remain the same as in the previous quarter.

The Treasuror does not receive a monthly salary but instead receives a 
payment of VTs as set in the Treasuror's budget as soon as possible 
after e is elected.


Create a rule titled "The Treasuror's Budget" with the following text.

The Treasuror's Budget shall include the following: 

(1) The salary of every officer that receives a monthly wage.
(2) The unemployment benefit.
(3) The payment of the Treasuror.
(4) Any other material that is required by the rules to be in the 
Treasuror's budget.

The above shall be given in integer multiples of 0.1, of the Basic 
Officer Salary, between 0 and 4 times the BOS inclusive. (E.g. 3.2*The 
BSO).

If there is no valid version of the Treasuror's budget, there shall be 
a budget created as soon as possible by the chancellor.  This budget 
shall contain all the information that is required to be in the 
Treasuror's budget and shall be set, as best as is possible to the 
values of the previous quarter.  The resultant budget shall be 
considered to be the Treasuror's Budget.  The Chancellor shall post 
this budget to the public forum.




Amend rule 1858 to read

      when it had an amendment number one less than it 
      currently does.

      includes the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity 
      which possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last 
      posting of the Accountor's Report.

A short time ago I had been about to post with precisely the above 
remark of Michael's - then hit the 'cancel' button when precisely the 
above objection occurred to me. ;)

Still and all, I don't think we can avoid the conclusion that the 
fact of embedding a communication with potential legal significance 
within a larger volume of text of no legal significant should have 
some bearing on our interpretation of "clear indication" in such a 
context. Something along those lines - if Steve's post had in fact 
been three email messages - one with the first 'spam' part, a second 
with the Proposals, a third one with the rest of the spam - the 
Proposals would have stood out more clearly. In particular, if Steve 
had used a different Subject: header for the second message, that 
particular message would have been read with essentially the same 
attention as other agora-business messages. And of course anyone 
opening the second message would immediately have spotted the legal 
significance of its contents, rather than delete the message out of 
hand as would have been the case for the other two, categorized as 
'spam' after only a single glance at the first dozen or so lines.

So, these characteristics of a single mail message - its Subject 
line, its overall length, and the impression of a subject matter that 
the first few lines convey - are in fact as much part of the 
communication as "the words themselves" (as Crito refers to the part 
of Steve's message that, if they'd stood on their own, would have 
been a 'clear indication'), in that their modification will elicit 
different behaviours on the part of the recipient of the entire  
communication - which includes "the words themselves".

Given the case of a single message which contained, say, 10 Calls For 
Judgement, one Nomination, and at the end some Proposal worded 
similarly to Steve's, our judgement on whether this constituted a 
'clear indication' would have to take into account the fact that the 
first parts of the message were themselves clearly intended to have 
legal significance; and if the Subject line was '10 CFJs, a   
Nomination, and a Proposal' the case would be clear-cut.

Hey, and we still haven't gotten around to the charges of 
Impersonation and/or Misrepresentation yet. ;)

I hope to get some CFJs out on Misrepresentation tonight.  I'm
not particularly convinced of Impersonation, so I'll let someone else call
that if anyone's interested.

Yes, I'm afraid so.  Unfortunately, this is not without controversy either.  8)

If it is to be clear in all senses of the word that can reasonably be
applied then, in my opinion, the entire context must be considered.  How
else can we determine if it is free from obstruction.

And we need nothing to tell us that at all.  I require it to meet all
definitions that could reasonably and consistently be applied to the word in
the context of the rule.  I merely said that those definitions were what *I*
think of when I think of a clear indication.  But what I think is
irrelevant.  If we can consistently require all of these definitions then we
are required by the rule to do so as it doesn't specify any particular sense
of the word.  An indication that is "easily understood" is not necessarily
"free from obstruction" but can be both and in the absence of any compelling
reason not to believe the rule requires both, we must interpret it as
requiring both.

I don't understand this.  Why do you feel that it's an either-or situation?
I feel it requires the indication to be clear in all reasonable senses of
the word.  I'm not arguing against Steve's definition so much as I'm saying
"Yes, and this too."

So?  Does that fact mean that a clearly worded statement is always a clear
indication?

> Does

It refers to an indication.  Merely posting the 'collection of text' with no
additional wording could be an indication of making a proposal (and I think
you will find that it has been treated as such.  Thus we preface draft
proposals with the word Pro-Proposal else they would count as Proposals).
There is no requirement to actually say "The following is a proposal" or
something similar.  Yes, Steve did include words to that effect but did they
clearly indicate the intent?

The words themselves are merely a part of the context of the message which
helps to make the indication of the purpose of the "collection of text"
clear.  They are not the indication but merely part of what makes it clear.
It is the context in which the "collection of text is deliver(ed)" that is
the indication.  We should feel free to examine as much of that context as
is necessary to determine whether the indication passes the test of clarity.

In this case I think it fails that test.

I submit you cannot make such a substitution.

Since I have been such a vocal opponent of Steve in this debate over his
proposal to repeal Summary Adoption, I would like to take the opportunity to
say I was, and am now, in agreement with Steve that SA was an extremely
dangerous mechanism and one which needed immediate action to correct.  So
while I honestly feel that Steve's attempt should be judged as having
failed, I applaud him for his efforts, if not his means, against this great
evil.

Of course I am in favor of similar, but safer, mechanisms.
