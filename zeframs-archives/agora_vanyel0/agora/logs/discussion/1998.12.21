Steve,

Time is short now, especially considering the time difference
between us, so here is my judgement on CFJ1110.

---Judgement---

I sustain the TRUE verdict for CFJ 1110.

The truth or falsity of this CFJ statement depends on what it
means for a Voting Period to have ended.  The simplest and
most natural answer to this is to say that a VP has ended as
long as the date designated by the Rules to be the end of that
VP is in the past.  At the time this CFJ was called, there were
only two dates that the Rules ever designated as the end of
the VPs for these proposals.  Both of these dates were in the
past relative to the time of this CFJ, and by this definition a
judgement of TRUE was supported.

However, much ink has been spilled on the discussion list
concerning the possibility that the "now" pointer of time must
have passed through the designated date for the VP to actually
have ended.  This viewpoint relies on the notion that the end
of a VP is an event such as the striking of a gavel (marking the
end of the VP).  However, IMO, the text of the Rule 693 does
not support this viewpoint.  It does not even mention the end of
the VP specifically, it merely specifies the VPs duration.  Duration
is an attribute that the Rules are free to change at any time.  (IMO,
R101 prevents a change of attribute from having any effect on
events in the past, but this is an issue that is irrelevant to the truth
or falsity of this particular CFJ statement).  Therefore, I believe this
outcome is not supported and the judgement of TRUE should withstand.

It might be useful to point out that one consequence of this is the
fact that the time period during which votes may legally be cast on
a particular proposal need not correspond to any time period designated
as a Voting Period of that proposal.  But this should not be so surprising
when one realizes that VPs are not defined in terms of when votes
may legally be cast, but that legal votes are defined in terms of
VPs.

  Assigned to Appeals Board:               as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

When P3809 took effect, it set the Voting Period to seven days.
Proposals 3810-3812 were distributed on Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29
(GMT).

Now there are, as far as I can see, three possible hypotheses as to when
the Voting Period on these proposals ends:

     i) Seven days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

    ii) Ten days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Thursday, December 10.

   iii) At the time P3809 took effect,
        at 07:55:39 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

Now I don't have any particular opinion as to which of these is true,
but I note that it doesn't make much practical difference whether it is
(i) or (iii), as no votes were cast during this period. The times
mentioned in the Statement are the times of the last recorded

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I rule true.

I have read the arguments. i think votes that were legal when cast
counted.  I don't buy that the VP was changed for all past proposals
were changed.

This is one of the points I have been trying to make over the last few
days.  The "effective voting period" (the period during which votes
can be effectively cast) need not have any correspondence with the
Voting Period.

I must say, I really disagree with your example.  After the amendment the
paragraph would read

"This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall have no effect. This
paragraph is deleted from this Rule one week after it is added to this
Rule."

I find it extremely hard to interpret the latter sentence as being able to
remove the paragraph at any other time than exactly one week after the
paragraph's addition.

(A second issue is that the meaning of "one week after it is added to this
Rule" is somewhat nebulous when the text of the current paragraph has not,
in fact, been added but merely amended to its current state.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.
