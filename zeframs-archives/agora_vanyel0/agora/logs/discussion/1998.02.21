The intention is for each player to start with two Plots, and have to 
earn the third (not that it takes much work).

That's intentional. Weekly Maintenance Fees would be fractional (or 
Mines would have to produce more), and what's more, would be a pain 
in the a** to pay. Monthly Production would have to be fairly large, 
and it would slow down the ability of the economy to respond.

BTW, since I'm too lazy^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hunable to check, changing the 
type of a Plot (or Mule) is supposed to result in the loss of a 
week's production, in addition to the cost - did that get removed? 
Actually, did it get added in the first place?

The upkeep on the first Mule of each type owned by a single player is 
higher.

I decided to do this myself, so I'll put mine after yours.

First, each player starts with 5 VTs, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs. E can 
spend 5 VTs, 4 P-Notes, and 12 Ergs immediately to get 3 Plots with 
non-Idle Structures.

Correct. Since *someone* needs to build Mines, that person would 
produce 3 Ergs per week. Note that having *all* Houses and Farms in 
optimal positions is impossible; the ones on the edges get shafted.

Assuming that all these structures are the same type, and 
the diversity penalty is reinstated (again: *MURPHY*!!!), there is 
a monthly upkeep of 4 Ergs. This is not quite covered by the 3 
Ergs left over from the initial allowance (which should be lowered 
to 12 Ergs, IMO), so unless the player has a Mine or three, e 
will have to beg, borrow or steal another Erg.

Final breakdown:
Type		Upkeep/mo	Production/mo
3 Mines		4 Ergs		12 Ergs
3 Houses	4 Ergs		36 P-Notes
3 Farms		4 Ergs		36 VTs

This gives us a maximum of 24 VTs+P-Notes per player per month. 
Since most Structures will be placed non-optimally, and some players 
will certainly want to have more than one type of structure, a 
reasonable estimate is a total of 8-16 VTs and P-Notes together per 
player per month, not accounting for Churches and being fairly 
optimistic (IMO).

Okay, here you're right - Murphy seems to have removed a critical 
element of the concept. There is supposed to be a fixed 3 Structures 
per player, and the only way to get more is to have a new player 
register.

The rules seem to specify it well enough:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

Thus if there are zero Proposals with Priority greater than zero, 
then the batch for that week shall consist of zero Proposals.

This is certainly an essential part of the proposal. In fact, I'd 
say its _the_ essential part of the prop. The idea is to encourage
trade. As I have pointed out in the past, trade is only going to 
occur when we have an imbalance of supply. Ie, each player has a large
supply of one commodity, but lacks another. In order to set up this
situation, it is essential that it is cheaper to produce one commodity
in bulk, than it is to produce small amounts of everything.

> Type		Upkeep/mo	Production/mo
> 3 Mines	4 Ergs		12 Ergs

> 3 Farms	4 Ergs		36 VTs

With 16 registered players, each with a fully specialised setup 
(which is cheapest in terms of Ergs), we would have a drain of 
64 Ergs/month. Thus requiring 5 1/3 (say 6) players producing only
Ergs. Leaving 10 Players to supply all our VT & P-Note needs.

This means that we can create 360 VTs+PNotes a month, which is 90/week
or 5.625/player/week. Seeing as VTs are more widely used than P-Notes,
I imagine this would come down to about 5 VTs and 0.5 - 1 P-Note per
player per week.

IMO this is too high. As I argued in an earlier message (which doesn't
seem to have been distributed yet) I think we should keep supply close
to cost levels. 1 VT/player/week is plenty (remembering that we have
other inputs, such as Officer's Salaries). 1 P-Note/player/week is
excessive.

I recommend cutting down the supply rates drastically.

No he's not. The election for Justiciar started later than the others,
when Morendil made the call for Elections. I don't have the original
message anymore, but going by Murphy's (excellent) journal, there are
still about 3 more days to go for this Office (as well as Assessor,

There is a distinct problem with trying to balance the economy around 
here. What I would like to see is a system where input and output are
pretty much balanced, with some fluctuations. The difficulty in is trying
to predict the way a rule change will affect spending habits. It's not
good enough to just work on the past patterns of spending. We saw that
when Pay-for-voting was adopted. Before that, people cast an average 
of votes a week, so we legislated to give them 8 VTs a week. But 
spending patterns changed, people stopped voting on every proposal
that came along, and 8 VTs became a fortune.

Part of the root of the difficult is this: spending around here is 
almost purely competitive. Real costs are small - it only takes 1 PNote
to make a proposal, and 1 VT to pass it. The only reason to spend more
than that is in order to compete with other players. The more currency
there is available, the more room there is for competition, so the 
higher the prices will go.

In this light, I recommend that the proposer of Plots severely 
underestimates spending patterns. When the supply gets close enough
to the real costs, then competitive spending is limited. People cannot
afford to be free and easy with their wealth. Competition will have to
be weighed carefully against what the player can really afford.

And if you underestimate things too far, at least it will be interesting.
I think this period of VT scarcity we are going through has been one of
the most intriguing periods of our game history. Voting has clearly 
become very strategic, and in some cases has required a bit of cunning.
I like that.

And again, I think it should be easier to move, should we choose to,
from a period of scarcity to one of greater wealth, than to move in
the opposite direction. History has shown how many ways players can
devise to hang onto their wealth. 

One of these days I will write a thesis on this.

Sounds to me like you've pretty much summed up the problems faced by
anyone trying to control an economic system of any kind. ;)

If it only takes 20 players and 3 currencies to end up with a system
prone to butterfly effects, I wonder how anyone can be arrogant
enough to claim they can understand, let alone model, real-world
economies....

If we change the production of Houses to 1 P-Note and Farms to 1 VT
per week, then 10 players could produce 30 items (P-Notes or VTs) a
week. This is something like 1 VT and less than 1 P-Note per player,
which should be a rate of supply which will not lead to another glut.

Looking over the Plots proto now, I cannot say that I like what I see.
It seems to be suffering from creeping featuritis. I hardly recognise
the proto I once made. No offence to Murphy, but there are far too
many different things being attempted in one proposal. I do not like
the way it revamps the creation & destruction of currencies, and the 
Blueprints mechanism is, imho, needless complexity. I'd much rather
see a drastically pared down version, and add the rest of the stuff
at a later date, if we so decide. That's probably the only way we 
are going to get this thing to work.

Sorry to denigrate other people's attempts to get this thing to work,
but I started this thing, and now I rather feel like it has lost 
its direction. So much so that the original purpose, which was to 
create supply imbalances, has been completely omitted in the latest
proto.

If nobody else will be greatly offended, I think I'll put together
my own, simplified version of this prop, which does those things I
first intended it to.

I think the major problem with Plots is that it is not automatically
adjusting.  The prices and rates are all legislatively fixed, rather
than floating to market, which means that instead of tuning itself,
the economy has to be legislatively retuned whenever spending habits
change.  This means that we will be forever tinkering in order to keep
the economy balanced.  Yuck.

This is incorrect.  The nominating period for Registrar is open until
Tuesday, as this election started later than the others. 

Michael.

No, it's not _the_ essential part - that's the three-Structure limit, 
which appears to have also been chopped.

This is assuming that every House is next to four Farms, and every 
Farm is next to four Houses. Which is impossible. As I said, those 
aren't reasonable estimates; those are maximums. Also, they 
completely ignore Churches, which are likely to be built by 
*someone*.

I'd say those numbers are too high by a factor of 2 or 3.

This is, in fact, the basic rate (as I'm sure you know).

I agree completely. Also, as I've said, in an apparent effort to pare 
down the proposal, several of its most important features were 
discarded.

Are you planning to revive an older version of Plots, or Jobs?

Well, you have to legislatively fix something, somewhere - even Real 
World(tm) currencies are supported by the (fixed) laws of physics. 

The idea of Plots is to add a sort of 'overflow drain'. If VTs and/or 
P-Notes are devalued, the value of Indulgences will be higher in 
comparison. People will change Houses and Farms to Churches 
(raising the value of Ergs) and Mines, and the abundance of VTs and 
P-Notes will decline. At least, that's the theory - the only way to 
check it is to pass Plots, but I believe it will work.

Well, the Plots proto does offer more market flexibility than what we
current have. The players get to decide what they are going to produce.
If one currency drops in value, then players producing it are going to
be worse off, so they should change there Plots to produce something 
else. The system can settle to a new equilibrium.

Of course, we may still arrive at a point where there is no satisfactory
equilibrium, or where the equilibrium produces more commodities than
necessary. If you can find a way to avoid that, give up playing Nomic
and go save the world.

I say that Plots offer a better opportunity for a self-regulating 
market than any other system we have implemented. I don't know if it
will work, but I think it will be very interesting to find out.

Actually, at the time I wrote that, I had not checked out the actual
values in the proposal, but was working from the others' calculations.
I'm a bit confused now as to where they got their data from. 

My apologies for criticising something without looking at it carefully
myself.
