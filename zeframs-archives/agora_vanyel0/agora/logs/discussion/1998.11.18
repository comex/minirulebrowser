Hi Andre!

I hope it doesn't take you too long to manage to get to grips with the
tangled web of our ruleset.  It'll be nice to have you back in the
game.

I agree with Steve that only being able to set the salary once a month
is a pain.

I don't think that a moribund economy in December is too high a price
to pay.  December tends to be fairly quiet in any case, so even if we
did have perfect economic information, it would be easier not to
bother.

I thought i did send you a message saying I would try, but I understand
the kudo transfer.  Oh well.  I was hoping to have had made more

I could probably set up a system by the end of the year to do VT
accounting easily and reliably (modulo obnoxious legislative changes)
that might even allow access via the web and/or email.  I have my old
EV accounting system from when I was Assessor, and having since
learned how to do SQL and CGI, could probably improve on it
considerably.  My time is kinda limited right now, with finals only a
few weeks away, but after finals are over I should have some time to
work on it.

(My old Assessor scripts would not work without some effort; if
nothing else, they need to have all the vote-counting stuff ripped
out.)

Protoproposal Chaos68 [rev. 1]

Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.

I would say that this is a fatal flaw.  Looking at Rule 1638, I draw
your attention to the word "has" in the first line, and in general the
usage of past tense language.  Rule 1638 doesn't say anything about
reporting that a Player "will win" the Game.  It seems quite clear to
me that Wins must be reported retrospectively, rather than
prospectively.

No chance of a stopover in Melbourne on the way to or back from NZ?

Hm. Tempting to nominate for Chancellor...but then there's my thesis.

Will you be revitalising your old campaign for "One Player, One Vote"?
If so, I welcome the return of a worthy opponent! :)
