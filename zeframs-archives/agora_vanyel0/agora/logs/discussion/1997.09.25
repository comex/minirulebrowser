I think I have a very vague notion of what you mean (since I've
started writing this reply to your message I have erased two or
three first paragraphs already - frustrating), but I don't see why
that would be the case in general - consider the following Proposal :

* Rule X shall be repealed after the rest of this Proposal's
   provisions have taken effect;
* Rule Z shall be amended to Y, etc.

Doesn't 594 "maximal extent" clause permit the first provision from
being applied at the "time" (or in the logical position) specified ?
Are you saying that such a requirement makes the first provision
inseparable from the later ones ? And if so, what do you think the 
consequences are ? (Sorry for sounding like the Spanish Inquisition, 
but your above comment intrigues me and I'd like to know exactly 
what you mean...)

Ow - don't you keep a few day's worth of a-d mail ? It would be 
easier for everyone if you just read the debate in there rather than 
ask for a summary at this time.

No Rule says how multiple Rule Changes within a Proposal are ordered,
or even that they *are* ordered, but that doesn't mean, necessarily,
that they are not or cannot be ordered. My (i.e. Elde's) Judgement in
933 relies upon Rule Changes in 3533 occurring in a certain order; my
reasons for assuming this have been challenged on several grounds.

Because that's not the end of the argument, my friend, but merely the
beginning!

The argument that VTs were destroyed makes no essential use of R1527.
It requires only this: that VTs ceased to have Mintor before they
received a new one, in whatever sense of 'before', be it temporally
before or logically before, that you favour. If the provisions in
P3533 were adopted in a temporal order or a logical order, then
this requirement is met and VTs were destroyed. The Rules are silent
about the order, if any, in which provisions within a Proposal take
effect, but there is game custom and commonsense on the side of the
suggestion that they take effect in the order they appear in the Proposal.

The only way to resist the conclusion that VTs were destroyed is to
argue that all the provisions in P3533 took effect temporally and
logically simultaneously (ie, not 'at the same time, but in order',
but 'at the same time, period.'). But those who wish to overturn
Morendil's Judgement know very well how unattractive this position
is. It makes far more intuitive sense to think of the provisions
in a Proposal as taking effect in some order or other, and for exactly
the same reasons as it makes sense to consider individual Proposals
adopted at the same time as taking effect in a certain order, namely,
that an ordering is required to make sense of conflicting amendments.

I'm not sure myself what I meant. My remark was speculative, and
intended to provoke further speculation.

My intuitive idea about what severability amounts to is, I guess,
some kind of independence. So, here's one case to consider: a 
Proposal containing several rule changes, all to Power 1 Rules.
During the VP, however, another Proposal passes upmutating one
of the Rules to amended. So that rule change can no longer take
effect, but the others are OK, because each provision is severable
from the others.

Concerning your example: recall that R594 states that

      In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each
      provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

In the case considered, I think the Proposal does say that the first
rule change is not severable from the others, but R594 permits that,
so it's fine. That is, Rule X is repealed after (logically after or
temporally after, take your pick) the rest of the provisions in the
Proposal have taken effect.

But if R594 is mucking about with the order in which provisions
take effect in order that they be maximally implemented, can we
still say that provisions are independent of one another? And
doesn't that bear on the question of severability?

It is, but that's not the issue.  My point is that there is no conflict:
the Rules are silent on the interpretation of Proposals containing
order dependencies.

"Mob rule" may indeed have been a little emotive; it was late and
I was tired.

However, I don't think the mob does rule the Judicial system
at present. The political culture encourages Players to accept
the results of Appeals they don't like, and Justices know that
they are pretty much immune from sanctions for delivering unpopular
Judgements, even if, in theory, Proposals could be passed which
punished them for doing so in all sorts of ways.

The provisions in a single Proposal shouldn't *have* conflicting amendments
in the first place.  This is different from the case of two Proposals that
could be adopted simultaneously.

But the provisions in a Proposal can only be properly interpreted in the
context of that Proposal.  Implementing the provisions of a Proposal is
equivalent to implementing that Proposal.

I'd rule that a Proposal such as

| Steve is installed in the Office of Dogcatcher.
|
| A Rule is created reading "There is the Office of Dogcatcher".

in accordance with Game Custom, and in the absence of any overriding
consideration[1], must be interpreted to mean

| Steve is installed in the Office of Dogcatcher, if possible.
|
| Immediately thereafter, a Rule is created reading "There is the Office
| of Dogcatcher", if possible.

(Note that separability is also part of Game Custom.)  If the Proposal
were written this way explicitly, I'm sure we would all agree that its
first provision would not have any effect.

-zefram

[1] No Rule governs this aspect of interpretation of Proposals.  The most
likely overriding consideration would be explicit specification in
the Proposal.

And how, exactly, is this simpler than the concept of infinitesemal time?

A test case: suppose we have a Rule 3000 that says "whenever there are
exactly three Glorks in existence, they are immediately transferred to
the Frobnicator, if such an Office exists", and a Rule 3001 that says
"If there is ever no Frobnicator, the Speaker is Tainted".  If a Proposal
then says

| Repeal Rule 4000 ("Define the Frobnicator").
|
| The number of Glorks in existence is set to three.
|
| A Rule is created reading "There exists the Office of Frobnicator".

In your system, these provisions take effect in this order, but at the
same time.  When the second provision takes effect, Rule 3000 obviously
takes effect.  But does the Frobnicator exist when it does?  Apparently
not, since it happens after the repeal and before the enactment.  And does
Rule 3001 fire?  You seem to say no, but how can it not when Rule 3000
has taken effect under such circumstances?

If you inferred that, then you misunderstood.  As I've now explained in

are not in conflict, but apply to completely different aspects of the

Sure, it shouldn't happen. If we were all perfectly logical and rational,
it wouldn't happen. But, we're only human, and it *can* happen.

I was assuming that points in time can be adequately modelled as a subset
of real numbers.  For any two real numbers (a, b) exactly one of (a < b,
a = b, a > b) is true, whereas the General is asking for a system in
which (a < b, a = b) can be simultaneously true.

And what requirement is that, exactly? What continuity does R1586
impose?  Even you concede above that the Mintor of VTs after P3533 is
not the same Entity as the Mintor of VTs before P3533. R1586 concerns
continuity of *Entities*. It cannot be used to argue that VTs
continuously had a Mintor, in a context (such as this one) where
everybody agrees that different Entities are involved  In fact, I am
surprised that you think that R1586 is even relevant to this
discussion.

I'm perfectly prepared to accept that the provisions in a Proposal
are not adopted sequentially separated by infitesimal units of time.
If they are adopted at the same time, but in a certain order (which
I call a 'logical order'), then that is enough to show that CFJ 933
is true. I don't see how the "maximal extent" provisions in R594 can
be of use to you here. The interpretation of the effects of P3533
defended by Morendil and myself has those provisions implemented just
as maximally as yours does. R594 cuts no ice here either way.

Then you're half way to admitting that commonsense and game custom do
indicate that the provisions in a Proposal are adopted in some order,
be it temporal or logical. In fact, you've as much as admitted
already that you do think that the provisions in Proposal take effect
in a logical order. To resist my conclusion, then, you need to find a
way of denying my argument that a logical ordering is sufficient for
a Judgement of TRUE. Come, then! Produce such an argument, or have
done, and admit I have persuaded you.

Terminology for non-mathematicians:

'total ordering of events': for any pair of events <A,B>, either
A is strictly later than B, or B is strictly later than A. (No
truly simultaneous events.)

'partial ordering of events': for any pair of events <A,B>, either
A is no later than B, or B is no later than A. (Some truly
simultaneous events.)

'later' is neutral between 'temporally later' and 'logically later'.

In my view, the choice is not between what kind of total ordering,
temporal or logical, we think events occur in. In my view, there's no
effective difference between a temporal total ordering, or a logical
total ordering.  The real choice, as Morendil has stated, is between
viewing all events as totally ordered, or as only partially ordered.
If events are only partially ordered, then true simultaneity of events
is possible. But the partial ordering view faces difficulties as soon
as simultaneous and conflicting events occur (as you note above). In
order to determine the outcome in such a situation, you suggest that
Courts be allowed to break the tie, on a case by case basis. I think
there are problems with that, but let's put them to one side. What
the Courts are doing in breaking the tie is simply re-imposing a
total ordering on events!  So the partial ordering view is unstable,
since eventually it's necessary to collapse it into some version of
the total ordering view in order to make sense of it. Why not just
start with the view that events are totally ordered?

An interesting position to take. Are you arguing that we should prohibit
Proposals that contain conflicting amendments ? That's going to rule out
a lot of the more interesting Proposals...

You may not believe a computer scientist could complain about
something being too algorithmic, but I believe this is such a case.  I
think it's better to specify what needs to occur a bit more abstractly
rather than laying down an exact procedure.  We don't have a rule such
as the one Kolja A. was batting for earlier which says that it is
acceptable to do things one way if the end result is the same..

No, you've changed the meaning of the rule, rather than just reworded
it.  I want this action to be the preserve of the Speaker.  Your
formulation allows the CotC and the Justiciar to go it alone in this
action.

I don't doubt that, either. The fact that you've been using this
ordering paradigm all the time is a strong indication that it can't be
too bad. 

But why this is so, and why it works better than a naive simultaneity
paradigm, is not immediately obvious for a newbie like me,, and being a
late 20th century individualist (and from Germany, where we're trained
to never just believe or do something because some authority or other
tells us to) I appreciate hearing a _reason_ why the ordering paradigm
is better. Some recent posts have begun to address this (thanks Steve
and Morendil), and I think I understand you position better and better.

I was trying to make sense of Steve's making sense of this :-), and
decided that this comes down to whether or not we allow the
possibility of rules "firing" while a rule change is in progress. 

The rules which specify that a change is to be made to the game state,
specify that a change must come about.  The question is whether or not
such a change is atomic..

We could model the game as an evolving system where game states evolve
in accordance with the rules of the game and the actions of Players.  

So we get some sort of chain of states:
  
 s0 ---> s1 ---> s3 ...

Each ---> represents a legal evolution under the control of the
rules.  If the change represented by a rule change is a single --->
then inconsistencies, such as those possible when multiple provisions
are present, are not a problem because the rules which detect those
inconsistencies do not pertain. 

On the other hand, if a rule change with multiple provisions merely
sets in place a sequence of changes that must take place but which
might interleave with other rule-firings, then there is a definite
problem.  

Temporality has nothing to do with it, in my opinion.  We just have to
look to the rules and/or game custom to see if rule changes in a
single proposal can be treated as atomic.  My view is that they
probably are, and I think this is also Scott's view.  With support for
this interpretation of how the rule change rules work, we also have a
securely entrenched system because those rules are all of high Power.

Michael.

Good point.  In that (very unlikely) situation, I will make the
Justiciar automatically the Judge for all CFJs I guess.

In the first new rule "Acuity recorded" : 

  Generally, if a change to Acuity would see it fall below zero, the
  change is altered so that the Acuity becomes zero.

I want to allow the selected Justice the chance to delegate.
Otherwise, the process becomes random.  This still gives
Office-holders who have become unfit to act as Justice some
influence.

Official Documents are not the same as Official Reports, (see, for

I'm amazed at this vitriolic and boorishly ill-mannered reaction.  I don't
give a hoot whether 3533 was flawed.  I don't care terribly much which way
933 goes (though I suppose it's more convenient for all if it's overturned,
but we've survived worse).

Could it be that Morendil is upset over the possible reversal of a CFJ that
he called and then judged?  There _is_ such a thing as caring too much.

By now I am quite willing to accept that the idea of ordering events
makes sense. Maybe the wording with infinitesimal times is a bit
unfortunate, and simply stating, as in 376, that they happen "at the
same time, but in a defined order" would be better, but that doesn't
change the concept.

Nevertheless, this concept led to a completely unwanted side effect
when the PC proposal took effect. How can such side effects be avoided
in the future?

Answer a: just write the proposals more carefully. That is more work
for complex reforms like PC, less for simpler proposals, but
possible. 

It does, however, add an aspect to the art of proposal writing which
you may like or dislike (I tend to dislike it, because it makes it
even harder for newbies not aware of these issues to make successful
proposals): Effectively, every proposal that has to do with entities
will have to go through a checklist of possible side effects on the
continuity of these entities through the stages when parts of the
proposals have taken effect while others are still in the queue. 

More generally, every multi-step proposal needs to be checked for its
effect on the game state after each of the single steps. The steps
must then be arranged in the appropriate order, and special provisions
may be necessary to exclude unwanted side effects explicitly. This
will be a lot of a hassle, and it will always be possible to miss
something.

Maybe a short explanation of this problem and a short checklist of
things that might make a proposal do unexpected things would be a good
part for the Welcome Wagon, if we ever reintroduce one.

Answer b: Let the different parts of a proposal take effect in an
order, but isolated from the rest of the game. In Morendil's picture,
treat them as beads on a string, but with no possibility to have any
event slip in between the beads or refer only to some, but not all of
them. Someone else has suggested something like this before. 

Such ordered series of events would then take place in a kind of time
bubble, but provisions like the currency destruction of 1579 could
only be triggered by the state of affairs before the whole bunch of
changes, and after it (i.e. after all provisions of a proposal have
taken effect).

A problem with this strategy may be that sometimes side effects which
would be avoided by such an isolation of the ordered bunch of events
are wanted - can one of the "old hands" estimate how large this danger
is? 

Of course we can always leave things as they are, keep making smilar
mistakes and enjoy the ensuing crisis...

I'm amazed by this reaction.

Rule 217 requires Judges to judge according to the "best interests of the
game" in certain cases.  Rule 594 requires the Rulekeepor (and other
officers) to implement the provisions of a Proposal to the maximal extent.
Morendil seems to be saying that it's reasonable for Judges to obey Rule
217 but unreasonable to require the Officers to obey Rule 594.

Does this mean that we are all free to ignore rules that we consider "too
subjective"?

"An arbitrary proposal?"  I do not need to respond to such an absurd challenge.

However, for most reasonable Proposals, here is an easy criterion:  if one
ordering allows us to implement all provisions in a Proposal, and a
different ordering requires us to ignore some of the provisions, then the
first ordering is to be preferred, according to 594.

I expect the Officers (and other Players) to obey the Rules.  I do not need
to write for Morendil a definite algorithm for the outcome of applying the
Rules to an arbitrary gamestate.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

I finished a recent post by claiming:

> are all of high Power.  

Except of course R594, which is only of Power 1. 

If this rule is that which allows amendments of rules in general, do
we have a rule system which allows amendments of high Power rules?

I don't think so, upon examination of some of the relevant rules. 

But I do think we have a situation where we have only a Power = 1 rule
stating that adopted proposals turn into instruments of Power equal to
their Adoption Index.  We could amend this rule to state that the
Power of adopted Proposals was equal to 10 with only an AI of 1.

Bug!

I propose the "up-mutation" of R594..

Michael.

I would argue that this is precisely the situation that pertains
already.  Why should the change to the state required by a rule change
be interrupted?  A proposal says "do X" (where X may be a relatively
complicated program of changes), and then R594 says that upon the
proposal's adoption, we should go about doing X.  The interventionist
view point says that we can interrupt the process of calculating the
new state that results from doing X.  It seems unreasonable to me.

Non-existent is my guess.  If as a proposal author, you want a
particular consequence, you are likely to ensure that the
circumstances that trigger that consequence obtain at the end of the
state-change.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a logical ordering as
opposed to a temporal ordering.

> Why not just start with the view that events are totally ordered?

I agree that all events are totally ordered.  However, I don't think
that this necessarily leads us to the conclusion that VTs were
destroyed.  In particular, I think you need to argue that other rules
are allowed to interrupt R594 in mid-flow and bring about legal
effects.  

A proposal is an embodiment of some function from states to states.
In particular, it is a simple algorithm for computing that function.
(Incidentally, it seems to me that if a Proposal embodied an infinite
loop, then 594 might put us in an uncomfortable position; it doesn't
limit the language used for the expression of the 'algorithm'. No
wait, it seems reasonable that loops should determined to be
'inapplicable'.)

Now R594 tells us to apply the algorithm to the current game state,
and to compute the result (rules other than 594 may qualify exactly
what is possible).  Of course some changes will be illegal (e.g., some
rules are protected by high Power ratings), possibly making steps
fail.  Whether or not this failure of steps causes the algorithm as a
whole to fail is dependent on the 'severability' or not of the
proposal's various provisions.

(Note that only rules are protected by Power ratings, but one could
imagine extending Power ratings to maintained documents, and there is
nothing stopping someone from writing a rule which says that "No
proposal may change the X factor", and this rule would effectively
protect (the document listing) the X factor with the rule's own Power
rating.  ([Open question]: if a Proposal of Power x conflicts with a
rule of Power x, which wins?))

If we accept this general view of the proposal mechanism and how it
works, the burning issue is:

  Does the state-change algorithm embodied in the proposal's
  provisions get computed all at once, or do its steps get applied one
  by one, with other rules able to perceive the intermediate results
  of the steps?

Temporal and logical orders are surely an irrelevancy here.  The
situation is that of a mathematical object (alternatively, a
collection of documents) which is being changed by a set of steps.  In
a proposal which consists of several distinct provisions, we have to
calculate some composition of state-change functions.  If those
functions commute (if f followed by g results in the same state as
that achieved by applying g and then f), then you might like to think
of the functions being applied simultaneously, but you can't do this
in general, and it's at best a mental convenience.  

Common-sense and game custom make it clear that these functions
(provisions) are composed in the order in which they are presented.
Other possible orderings shouldn't be considered because of this
reason, and it is also clear that simultaneity is a mirage.

Michael.

IMHO, they cannot, as complex Proposals, of necessity, include a larger

That sounds to me as if you were saying, for instance, that cooking
is a hassle because you have to make sure you add every ingredient
in the correct sequence, so that for instance the water will have
come to a boil before you put in the spaghetti. (And *that* is a
trivial recipe.) But that's not a hassle - that's precisely where
the fun, creative aspect of cooking resides. And so it goes, as
far as I'm concerned, for crafting Proposals.

This is a can of worms. Proposals *rely* on certain Rules being
effective, and certain events occurring, as their provisions are
being applied. Most notably the Rules governing Rule changes,
though other Rules might also be vital. I have no idea which ones,
though, nor do I think that can be fully determined.

The problem with Proposals as complex as 3533 is that what they do
amounts to modifying large parts of a complex machinery, without
ever stopping the machine - which you can't do anyway because the
machine's operation is what permits you to reach inside it to
add metaphorical gears and levers and stuff like that. When you pull
it off, it's beautiful, but when you make a small mistake, the
results can range from embarrassing to disastrous. Then again,
even the disastrous effects are entertaining.

We don't have any useful concept of "fuller" to use here, so I can't
imagine how we are supposed to assess what it means.  Plausibly it
might mean that the resulting state differs the most from the initial
one, but we don't have any metric for assessing differences betwen
states either.

In my opinion the only sense we can make of "maximal" is that each
provision should "try its hardest" to have an effect, and that the
previous failure of other provisions shouldn't affect them.  In other
words, this use of "maximal" is simply a restatement of the default
severability condition.

Well, sure but this is pretty meaningless, as you might as well say
that were implemented in reverse order..

I suppose I am saying that, if you look at it a certain way. If I were
Rulekeepor, I would certainly balk at examining all of the 120 possible
ordering permutations of a Proposal containing a mere 5 provisions to
determine which one is required by 594, and I'm not even going to
mention larger numbers. But it certainly seems to me that 594 can't
possibly be requiring that.

Please note that your discussion on the matter has on the other hand
convinced me that a Proposal can be written that explicitly violates
its own textual ordering, as in your Dogcatchor situation. But then,
explicit instructions are no particular problem for the Rulekeepor,
or any Player.

> However, for most reasonable Proposals, here is an easy criterion:  if one
> ordering allows us to implement all provisions in a Proposal, and a

Take the example of 3533 - you'll agree that the criterion you give is
not requiring us to implement the provision making the Bank the Mintor
of VTs before implementing that which repeals the Mint, as neither
provision had to be ignored or was prevented from taking effect. As
far as I can see, in fact, all of its provisions were implemented,
which is the best a Proposal can do as far as 594 is concerned.

Now, your claim is basically that there is nothing special about the
'textual' ordering of the provisions in 3533. Suppose I find some
other ordering of that Proposal's provisions - say, last to first -
in which all are applied; as far as 594 is concerned, nothing prevents
me, or anyone in fact, from claiming that _that_ is the ordering
required.

But (insofar, of course, as Rule Changes within a proposal are totally
ordered, rather than partially ordered or unordered, to use Steve's
terms) we've seen that the end results of a complex Proposal can be
critically different depending on that ordering. I'm not going to
check what effects 3533 would have if implemented backwards, but
I suspect that they would be different from the 'textual' ordering.

Two provisions in a Proposal could each be fully implemented, but,
because of the Ruleset's complexity, each have repercussions so
far-reaching that reordering them would give rise to a very different
Game State.

Absent any other way to determine which of the various orderings that
are ranked as equal by 594 must take effect, don't you think the notion
to preserve the textual order makes sense ? And if not - you still need
a way to know which ordering is actually required.

Given the above, I think that what you need to convince your audience
of is that interpreting 594 as you suggest will not result in massively
indeterminate Game States. Your first attempt at a criterion does not
do that; I await the next.

OTOH your viewpoint (admittedly a novel one) seems rather radical to
me. Are you saying that *nothing* happens between the first and last
provisions of a Proposal - no Rule Changes, in particular ?

So the Dogcatcher example, rewritten as
* Enact a Rule establishing the Office of Dogcatchor
* Install Steve in the Office of Dogcatchor
would fail ?

Of course I suspect that you're going to say that's not the case,
because 594 requires that the first provision be implemented
first, i.e. that a Rule be created as a result of it, and then
that the second provision be implemented.

Now suppose that we have a Rule stating "It shall be prohibited to
enact a Rule which has the word 'Dog' in it". It seems to me that
we'd have to turn "interventionist" at this point, no ? IOW, it's
not only the Proposal that's a function for computing the next
Game State - all the Rules potentially participate. To carry out
this analogy to an extreme, the Proposal-functions are defined in
term of all Rule-functions.

Or, to couch this in terms of a computer program, which is what your
analogy now closely resembles, a Proposal is a program to compute
an output Game State from an input Game State. My opinion is that
Rules are to be thought of as subprograms, 'called' at various points
by the provisions in a Proposal, and that nothing prohibits one such
subprogram (e.g. the Rules calling for destruction of Currencies)
from havin 'side-effects', i.e. alter the Game State beyond what
the Proposal seeks to do.

In my opinion, while a Proposal is being implemented, all mechanistic
functions of the Rules are held in abeyance until the Proposal is
fully implemented.  Then all consequential actions "fire".  Rule 3000
"fires" because when the "hold" is released, there are three Glorks.
Rule 3001 does not because when the hold is released, there is a
Frobnicator, albeit a different one than before.

(I should also note that I very strongly disapprove of "automatic"
actions; they are antiPragmatic and compound the effects of game state
uncertainty.)

No, you are insisting that ordering be dependent only on time.
To be mathematical, you are unwilling to admit any ordering in which

What is the basis for this opinion?  I see no Rule suggesting that
the Rules are ever ineffective, nor is there any custom to this effect.
And what about Rules governing Rule Changes?  Or Rules that are triggered
by Rule Changes (such as the bonus for repeal)?

Indeed.  I just (independently) posted comments to the same effect.

I don't think the question has ever been seriously considered.  I
believe Zefram believes that they are divisible.  I don't know if
there is any strong argument either from game custom or from the Rules
for either point of view.  In my opinion, both common sense and other
standards argue for atomicity.

Michael> My view is that they probably are, and I think this is also
Michael> Scott's view.  

It is. 

I should note that the severability of provisions mandated by Rule 594
does not imply nonatomicity. The "severability" of provisions means
that the inability to apply a single provision does not invalidate the
entire Proposal.  It does (necessarily) not mean that the provisions
are otherwise divisible.  ("Severability" is a term of legal art, one
which might have been wiser avoided, or defined more clearly.)

No, the game state does change, as specified by the provisions of a
proposal.  The ruleset is part of the game state after all.  What I'm
saying is that the changes to be applied get uninterrupted access to
do their bit to the state of the game.  The degree to which they are
allowed to apply is governed by rules.

No, of course not.  The first change establishes the Office, the next
installs Steve in it.

Sure, it is definitely true that the rules determine which potential
changes are legal.  This is not controversial.  The rules determine
that changes to rules of high Power are not possible for a Proposal of
lower Power for example.

This is exactly the claim I made in my post of time-stamp 
  <Thu, 25 Sep 1997 12:17:04 +0100>
where I wrote:

  A proposal is an embodiment of some function from states to states.
  In particular, it is a simple algorithm for computing that function.

Give me an example of any proposal that seeks to 'call' various
rules.  Provisions of proposals call for changes to be made to the
game-state.  R594 says that in so far as these changes are legal, then
they happen.  It doesn't say that the process of computing the new
state can be time-sliced.  It says that the changes happen. 

So, when a proposal contains multiple provisions, we figure out what
those provisions mean in terms of their effect on the game state,
apply them in turn (substituting the null operation for those which
are illegal, unless the proposal opts for non-severability), and then
we can say that the proposal has had its effect.  

That this happens is indisputable as far as I can see.  The only issue
is whether or not the rest of the rules are allowed to interfere in
what is essentially *our* computation as to what the new state is to
be. 

Michael.

> Who cares?  Who would draft, or vote for, such an inane Proposal?

You should care. More innane Proposals have been drafted, and voted
FOR. Consider also that some Proposals can be generated automatically, by
mechanisms similar to the Frankenstein rules. And sometimes we have the
tendency to pass Proposals that we believe to be inane, simply for our perverse
amusement, or whatever.

FWIW (not much), I support the use of the word "infinitessimal" for
ordering. And "infinitessimal" should be rigorously defined.

There is as much basis for Scott's opinion (if not more), as for the
view that the changes embodied in a proposal are applied in some sort
of funny time-sliced manner. 

It is true that the rules governing rule changes might change in the
course of a proposal being applied.  This might legalise certain
subseqeunt provisions, but I don't see that this is problematic.  

Here, for example is a simple algorithmic interpretation of close to
what I believe happens in R594, where game_state is the current state
of the game.

for i = 1 to #of provisions in adopted proposal
do
  if (legal_change(game_state, provision[i])) 
        game_state := provision[i](game_state);
  else 
     if (fail_causes_break(provision[i])) break;

od

The fail_causes_break routine checks to see whether or not a provision
is severable from the provisions still to come.  This simple-minded
implementation does not address the possibility that authors might
want their entire proposal to have no effect if any provision fails.
Allowing for this possibility is simple enough (exercise for the
reader :-)

A rule such as that giving Players bonuses for repealing a rule is
not a problem.  If a proposal achieves a repeal, which is easily
determinable, the Player gets the bonus.  This is in fact quite close
to the wording of the rule in question:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

Indeed.  For those of a more computer-science-y bent, my little
program in a recent post tries to takes account of the notion of
severability.  As far as the program version is concerned, it isn't so
much default severability which is the difficulty, as the various ways
in which Proposal authors might want their provisions to be
non-severable, e.g., "this proposal shall only take effect as a whole
if 5 of the following provisions take effect..."

Ah, I forgot how that was worded.  What if we had a Rule that said
"whenever a Rule is Repealed, the Total Rule Count is decreased by one"?
Does the Total Rule Count change `before' later provisions of the Proposal
take effect?  Rules with triggering conditions like this are unfortunately
not readily modellable in common programming languages.

Ah, thanks - that will let me express more clearly what I have to
say :

legal_change(game_state gs, provision p) is
for i = 1 to #Rules do
  fail if Rule(i)->disallows(gs,p)
od

and my opinion is that in the case of 1579 we have

R1579::disallows(gamestate gs, provision p) is
for i = 1 to #Currencies do
  nextgamestate = gs->apply(p);
  if (nextgamestate->getMintor(Currency(i)) 
      Currency(i)->destroyUnits();
  succeed;
od

Isn't this fun ? Apologies on behalf of Michael and myself for those
out there who get bored to death with programming !

All Proposals do so. No Proposal can implement a single change to the
Game State without all Rules other than 594 first "having a look" at
that change, leaving aside considerations of Power. Otherwise there
is no way that these Rules could prevent certain Game State changes
attempted by Proposals to take effect, right ? If you can accept
Rules as subprograms being invoked to check each provision in a Rule
for a potential conflict, I see no reason not to accept that such a
Rule could also have side-effects.

Or you will have to make a special distinction between Rules that
could possibly prevent a provision of a Proposal from taking effect
(and argue that such Rules can be invoked during the Proposal's
'computation') and Rules that compute Game State changes but do
not bear directly on a provision's legality (and argue that those
Rules are not invoked). Me, I see no reason to make such a distinction.

I'd just like to say first that I apologize if I repeat anything which has
been already said.  Classes started up on Monday, which really kind of
coincided with the huge traffic hike on a-d, and I started skimming a-d, and
for a day or two, stopped reading it.  I just didn't have the time with all
of the new classes and professors to get used to.  I seem to be better now,
and I'm reading a-d again.

So if I make two rule changes in the same proposal, which will happen at the
same time, the rules can stick their nose in between those and affect the
game state?

I don't see how the Rules could possibly do that.  It seems the only way to
clear this situation up is to use the Rules to do so, so I call upon Rule 376.

      A Proposal which is Adopted takes effect at the time date-
      stamped on the first message sent by the Assessor to reach
      the Public Forum announcing the results of the voting on that
      Proposal.

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.

This states that the Proposal is Adopted at one point in time.  The whole
Proposal takes effect at the same instant, namely the time at which the
message is date-stamped.  That means that each rule change takes place at
that moment.  There's no time in between them for the rules to stick their
nose in and change things around.

If there's no time for other Rules to intervene, or for ordering within
a Proposal, then there's no time for the ordering of Proposals within
one message either.  (Applies equally well whether you use logical or
temporal ordering, as long as that choice is consistent.)

I consider this to be in the realm of law, not logic or

things to both be true, even about the same object.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Appeals decisions

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice elJefe's decision: SUSTAIN

>                               CFJ 930

> "No Payment Orders have thus far been successfully executed, for the
>  reason that none exist."

Judge Chuck relied on the reasoning of CFJ 929:

> However, at the time of the CFJ, only one Transfer Order could have
> been submitted, namely the Chancellor's transfer of 9 Indulgences
> from the Bank to Elde. At that time the Mint (which was Mintor of
> Indulgences) no longer had Mint Authority due to the effects of
> Proposal 3533. Thus Indulgences ceased to exist as a Currency by
> Rule 1579, and so the Chancellor's posting, not referring to any
> Currency, was not a Transfer Order.

The only point in dispute is whether Indulgences continued to exist as
a currency after the adoption of Proposal 3533.  If they did then the
reasoning in the quoted paragraph of CFJ 929 is correct and the
judgement of TRUE stands.  If not then the judgement in both CFJs
should be FALSE, since the Misanthropists' currencies failed to
confuse itself with Payment Orders or Transfer Orders defined in the
Rules.

Quoting from Rule 1579: "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist,
or ceases to have the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that
Currency are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist."  There is
unchallenged evidence that the old Mintor for Indulgences ceased to
exist, and that no new Mintor was designated.  Therefore unless this
conflicts with some higher-power Rule, it must be applied.

Rule 1435 begins "Indulgences are a Currency."  One possible
interpretation is that Indulgences were destroyed and ceased to exist
at a given instant; but then immediately after that R1435
re-established Indulgences as a Currency without a Mintor, which then
is immune to R1579 since it has no Mintor which can either cease
existing or lose Mint authority. (*)

This has several things wrong with it.  Rule 1435 is silent as to
whether Indulgences have a Mintor or not, so there is no conflict on
this point with R1579.  Thus any "re-establishment" of the currency
must follow the first sentence of R1579, which insists that each
Currency has a Mintor.

Further, the whole notion does not give sufficient respect to the
natural meaning of "cease to exist".  A rule mandating that something
ceases to exist does not mean for the thing to have its existence
interrupted temporarily and then re-appear.  If R1579 is strong enough
to destroy Indulgences (or P-notes) as a currency, then it is strong
enough to keep them destroyed.

This brings us to the central question: _is_ R1579 strong enough to do
what it says?  Well, does it conflict with R1435?  No.  R1435 simply
says that Indulgences are a Currency; R1579 says that they are in fact
a destroyed Currency. (**) This is similar to the repeal of a Rule;
longstanding Game Custom holds that a Rule or Proposal which repeals
another Rule is not for that sole reason in conflict with it. (***)
Thus 1579 did cause Indulgences to cease to exist, and they still
cease to exist to the present time.

NOTES:

(*) This possibility was raised during the discussion of the issues
surrounding a similar situation with regards to P-notes, so it is as
well to dispose of it here.

(**) My fellow learned Justice Michael objected that an earlier
version involves a "secret" insertion of "defunct" into the rule.
This wording is what I meant.

(***) My fellow learned Justice Michael also objected here, pointing
out that Rules and Rule changes occupy separate worlds.  But I feel
this misses the point of my analogy: a Rule Change (proposed or
unproposed) is effective only by virtue of Rules that allow it to take
effect.  Do those Rules (which affect the content of the Ruleset)
actually _conflict_ with the Rule being repealed?

This would be like having an implicit clause in each Rule that stated
"This rule may not be repealed"; game custom says it does not.
Similarly, Rule 1479 does not contain an implied "this currency may
not be destroyed" as part of its defining sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Justice Michael's decision: OVERTURN/reverse

If Indulgences exist, then a Payment Order was executed by the
Chancellor when he attempted to transfer 9 Indulgences from the Bank
to Elde.

If Indulgences exist, then the Indulgence Currency's Recordkeepor is
authorised to record and execute Payment Orders (R1596).

Thus, if Indulgences exist, the correct judgement for this CFJ is
FALSE.

The argument that Indulgences do not exist is based on R1579, which
states that all Currencies have a Mintor and if a Currency should lose
its Mintor, then it is destroyed.  It is accepted that an entity known
as the Mint was the Mintor for Indulgences before the Pragmatic
Currencies reform occurred.

By virtue of R1586, we must also accept that the Mint no longer
exists, so it would appear that the antecedent of the conditional
sentence of the second paragraph in R1597 holds.  So, what might
prevent Indulgences from being destroyed, as required by R1579?

The answer is the precedence taking R1435.  This states that
"Indulgences are a Currency".  This statement must remain true,
whatever R1579 says to the contrary.  My Fellow Justice elJefe claims
that this is possible if one reads "Indulgences are a Currency" as
"Indulgences are a destroyed Currency".

This is a senseless contortion.  We do not need to put the rules
through such hoops.  We have rules taking precedence over each other
all the time.  When we read "Indulgences are a Currency", we know that
this is equivalent to stating that there exists a Currency whose name
is "Indulgences".  But now the opposing argument wants us to
simultaneously read this as admitting the precise opposite, that this
Currency doesn't exist at all.

I refuse to make the Rules play such tricks.  If a high precedence
rule says that Indulgences exist, then the lower precedence R1579 can
yammer on about Mintors and the lack thereof all it likes.

Indulgences exist.

Judge elJefe's reasoning on CFJ 929 applies here as well.

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously

                               CFJ 944

For proposals distributed during the infection of R693, the ten days
immediately following the distribution of each such proposal will be designated
its Voting Period immediately upon the disinfection of R693.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
                                                         ^^^^^^^
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)
<<

As I explained in an earlier post, I think no such "instant" ever
--erm, what do instants do? exist? happen? well, never mind... --
anyway, there never was such an instant. That's why 1527 speaks of
infinitesimal time separations, not simply of small ones.

So the bank became mintor in time to save VTs, and so on and so on.

   19 Sep 1997 22:47:56 +0200 (MET DST)
======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

I find Kolja's analysis of 1527/376 interesting, and at the very least
it deserves closer examination.  I therefore call for the appeal of
CFJ 933.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
>      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a
>      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Elde, elJefe,

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

                               CFJ 940

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Rule 789 should be interpreted such that a document purporting to be

certain way, but which does not include a list of Relevant Rules

not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:
I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

My judgement on CFJ 942:

FALSE.

But for a reason no one seems to have noticed. I was, at first, quite 
inclined to agree with the Caller. In fact, I felt less equivocal about 
it than he did. It seemed to me that, in the absence of clear wording 
specifying that, without a list of Relevant Rules, the *Caller* had made 
an error or committed a crime, the correct interpretation would be that 
the CFJ was simply invalid without said list. The minimum requirement for 
that list would simply be a notation that the rule in question was itself 
relevant to the CFJ; after all, "a list of relevant rules" does not imply 
a *complete* list. And as anyone with LISP or set theory experience 
knows, a list with only one item is still a list.

But then I came to the part in the Caller's argument related to Rule 991. 
He noted that, under my interpretation of Rule 789, the two rules were in 
conflict. He then stated that, because of rule 789's lower number, it 
takes precedence. And that would be well and true except that Rule 991 
has a Power of 2, while Rule 789 has a Power of 1. Under Rule 1482 
(Power=3), Rule 991 thus takes precedence, and we are in a situation where

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.
      (991/3)

Therefore the statement is FALSE.

(Caller's) Arguments:

It seems that a new CFJ is required to put things right, now that CFJ 940 has
been judged TRUE.

Caller's Other Remarks:

[Note that if judged TRUE, the judge is required to execute these Payment
Orders.]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons:

The major problem in this situation is that the concept of payment 
orders, blots, and penalties are incredibly poorly defined in relation to 
each other.

First of all, we have R1435, which tells us that a P.O. for 1 Indulgence 
with a payee as the Bank is called a Blot. It then tells us that when a 
Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a P.O. shall 
be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for 
a # of indulgences equal to the # of Blots the Player is to receive.

Thus, we have now implicitly recognized the concept of "gaining" a 
payment order, since a PO for 1 Ind. to the Bank = a Blot. This is 
incredibly unclear wording. So once the Blotee has "gained" a payment 
order, someone else is required to "execute" a payment order. Are these 
P.O.'s the same? It's quite unclear. But, and the next paragraph of the 
rule gives some support for this, I'm going to assume that this is just 
poor phrasing.

So now someone is required to 'execute' the payment order. In this case, 
it was the CotC, under R408. A P.O. is "executed" by posting it to the 
Public Forum. So again, we have a point of confusion. Is a P.O. a 
message, or a string of text? Those things can be posted to the Public 
Forum. On the other hand, if that were the case, then any message in the 
correct form would be a P.O., and if it were specifically in the correct 
form under R1435, it would be a Blot. This is still a Blot, regardless of 
whether it has been 'executed.' So then, for example, I have a # of Blots 
= to the # of messages in that form that I have? Well, have where? In my 
mailbox? In some platonic mailbox? But then again, R1435 says a Player 
'may be said' to have a # of Blots = to something else entirely. Thus, a 
contradiction. Now, I'm not saying that this interpretation of a Blot as 
a message is correct, merely that is is highly unclear and ambiguous in 
the Rules.

R1596 never says that the *only* way a P.O. can be executed is for a 
player with the authority to post it to the Public Forum. Thus, except 
for one small point, I would be inclined to judge that R408, by assigning 
a penalty of 3 Blots to a crime, implicitly executes a P.O. for that 
amount. The problem, though (among many others I'm sure will be brought 
up over that point), is that a Blot "is to be executed by whomever is 
required to report the change in Blots." Thus, the CotC. So, as amazingly 
unclear as the situation is, it does appear that the CotC was required to 
'execute' the Blot/P.O.'s by 'post[ing] the Order to the Public Forum.'

So did he? *Yes.*

Why do I have a feeling this is going to be appealed? Anyway, here's why.

Here's what the CotC said: "Blob commits the Infraction of Failing to 
Judge, an action which bears the penalty of 3 Blots."

A Blot has been defined in the rules. Thus, this sentence is equivalent 
to:

Blob commits...an action which bears the penalty of 3 Payment Orders for 
1 Indulgence, the payees of which are the Bank. In my opinion, this 
"specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity, 
exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a 
positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ." 

The syntax and meaning of a 'penalty' makes it clear that Blob is the 
source entity, and the rest is clear.

The message concerning Elde was phrased identically. elJefe's was phrased 
differently:

"elJefe receives 3 Blots committing the Infraction of Failing to Judge."

So elJefe receives 3 P.O.'s? This syntax would seem to indicate that 
elJefe is the pay*ee* of this transaction! But the Bank is already 
defined as the payee, by the definition of a Blot. So this does *not* 
specify exactly one source entity and one destination entity. Thus, the 
CotC *did* fail to execute the required P.O. for the 3rd infraction. 
However, as the statement of the CFJ alleges that the CotC failed in all 
*3* cases, it must be judged FALSE.

A possible objection would be that R1435 specifies what it means to 'gain 
some # of Blots.' That is quite true -- it means that a P.O. shall be 
executed. But the P.O. was *not* executed, as R1435 does not mention 
anything about *messages* stating that players gain Blots, only about 
*Rules* which so state.

So my judgement is FALSE, CFJ 940 be damned. I have "considered game 
custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game 
before applying other standards." I personally think CFJ 940 was judged 
incorrectly; however, that is irrelevant here. I'm under no obligation to 
abide by past incorrect judgements. :) What a welcome back to Agora!

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to
be a Payment Order must, in order to satisfy that Rule's requirements
and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

Steve wrote:

and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

---

Arguments :

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence
>
>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster
>      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing

>      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

                               CFJ 938

"Rule 1513 should be interpreted such that, if a body of text has been

 Player to perform or not perform an action solely because the Rules
 fail to require that it be made available to that Player."

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1513 ends with this text:

     Especially, no body of text is permitted to require Players to
     perform or not perform any actions unless said body of text has
     previously been made available to that Player.

This says "Text T can bind Player P only if P has read T"; it does not
say "Text T can bind Player P only if the Rules require that P can
receive a copy of T".

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Attention Rulekeepor! This CFJ contains an Injunction to annotate
a Rule!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 939

The provision in R1504 which states that:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

  Judged TRUE by Zefram, 16 Sep 1997 09:59:01 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",
is a less natural (though still valid) construct.  Given such an
ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.

Rule 1596 should be interpreted so that a message purporting to

and qualify as a legal Payment Order, explicitly and unambiguously
state that the purported Payor is ordered to effect a payment as
a consequence of that message, e.g. by stating "Player X is commanded
to pay Y", the mere mention of an amount of a Currency, the name or
names of the Payor and Payee, or a reference to some Rule or some
situation that requires a Payment Order to be executed being
insufficient for a message not containing such a command or entreaty
to qualify as a Payment Order.

  Called by Morendil, 08 Sep 1997, 08:55 +0200
  Assigned to Chuck, 08 Sep 1997, 11:29 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Chuck, 14 Sep 1997, 16:11 CDT

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I believe this follows from Rule 1596's definition of a Payment Order
as "an order requiring an entity to" perform some action, and that no
message not framed as a command is a legal Payment Order.

Note that the claim that a particular message _is_ a Payment Order
is by that reasoning sufficient to satisfy Rule 1596's requirement.

I kindly request that the Judge of the CFJ enjoin the Rulekeepor to
annotate R1596 with the above statement and the list of relevant
Rules which follows : 1596.

======================================================================\

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

I judge this statement to be TRUE.

Injunction:
I hereby enjoin the Rulekeepor to annotate Rule 1596
with the statement and list of relevant Rules of this CFJ.

Reasons and Arguments:
I agree with the Caller's arguments.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

Judge:       Vlad

Judgement:   FALSE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, Chuck, Crito, Elde, elJefe, 
             General Chaos, Michael, Morendil, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, 
             Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Kolja A.
Barred:      Harlequin, Murphy
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

  Judged FALSE by Vlad, 16 Sep 1997 00:16 -0500 (CDT)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be

      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a
Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Oh yeah? I hereby dismiss the following CFJs assigned to me under 
*R1563*.  :)

947, 966, 969, 976, 980, 1002, 1003, 1029, and 1034.




I do not believe that they are  "able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE."
      
In addition, I consider them "vacuous" under this same rule.

Note that only one of these conditions needs to be met to dismiss 
them...I include both in the hopes of avoiding argumentation. Not that I 
really have any hope of that. :)

I hereby Dismiss both of these CFJs under 1565 (iii): these Statements
are (obviously) not relevant to the Rules.

Arguments from interested parties solicited on this one.  Note that
although the caller may have had the current batch in mind when putting in
this Statement, I will not probably not consider the current batch of CFJs
very important for this issue.

I hereby make a COE on this Statement of mine. Elde's Judgement has not
(yet) been appealed this week. I hereby admit this COE. The relevant part
of the message should read:

In the issue of the Appelate decision of CFJ 940 I find the Judgement
incorrect. To me the fact that something is a Payment Order makes it
a priori what a Payment Order is defined to be, no matter in what
exact form it is brought out.

As can be seen from the discussions on agora-discussion it is not easy
to decide when a certain text is a Payment Order and when it isn't.
However, we are not to judge on that, as the premisse in the Statement
already is that the message is purporting to be a Payment Order.
Any phrase making it clear that a text is a Payment Order, makes it so,
provided that the provisions in the second sentence of Rule 1596 are
met. If further it is posted to the Public Forum, and by a Player with
the authority to execute it, it is executed.

I thus find the Judgement incorrect, and request REVERSAL of the
Judgement.

I hereby call for judgement on the following statement:

======================================================================

CFJs 945-970 and 972-1044 do not contain a statement of the sort
required by rule 1563, and as such, must be dismissed.

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vky-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vacuously adverb
- vacuousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright  1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:


Relevant Rules: 1563

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Before I begin arguing, I'd like to say that when I refer to "the
statement", I refer to the statement "This statement is TRUE.", and when I
refer to "the CFJ", I'm referring to the CFJ I am submitting.  I'm keeping
this consistancy so that it's clear what I am talking about.

The statement "This statement is TRUE." cannot be determined to be either
TRUE or FALSE by means of logical reasoning.

If the statement is TRUE, then it follows that the statement is TRUE, and
there's no contradiction.  If the statement is FALSE, then it follows that
the statement is FALSE, and there's no contradiction.  Therefore, the
statement is both TRUE and FALSE and is not either TRUE or FALSE.

The statement is also vacuous, and is therefore not acceptable.

vacuous (vky-es) adjective
1.	Devoid of matter; empty.
2.	a. Lacking intelligence; stupid. b. Devoid of substance or meaning;
inane: a vacuous comment. c. Devoid of expression; vacant: "The narrow,
swinelike eyes were open, no more vacuous in death than they had been in
life" (Nicholas Proffitt).
3.	Lacking serious purpose or occupation; idle. See synonyms at EMPTY.
[From Latin vacuus, empty. See VACUUM.]
- vacuously adverb
- vacuousness noun

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Third Edition
copyright  1992 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Electronic version licensed
from InfoSoft International, Inc. All rights reserved.

definitions 2b, 2c, and 3 all support the statement being vacuous.
definition 1 would imply an empty statement, like a null set, but then
there would be no statement to be vacuous, so definition 1 does not apply.
definition 2a is a matter of taste, so it does not apply.

The statement has not substance or meaning in game terms or in terms of
anything other than the statement.

I'd like to also note that this CFJ must be judged TRUE if it is determined
by the judge that the statement cannot be judged TRUE or FALSE by logical
reasoning or the statement is vacuous.  Either one of those being TRUE (or
both being true) makes this CFJ true.

I will not accept this as a valid dismissal.

Rule 1563 states:

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This 'as described elsewhere' apparently points to Rule 1565, which states:

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

I don't think you notified me of the reasons you were dismissing this.
Also your dismissal is illegal according to Rule 1565, although it might
be argued that Rule 1563's higher precedence avoids problems in this case.

You are correct.  1563 says that I must dismiss it, and also that the rules
for dismissing it are found elsewhere, namely Rule 1565.

I hereby dismiss CFJs 950, 979, 988, 1005, 1020, and 1041 under Rule 1563
because they cannot be determined logically to be either TRUE or FALSE and
because they are vacuous.

Evidence (applies equally to all 5 statements): Rule 1563, Rule 1565.

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

Rule 1565/3 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 3
      Mil.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.

I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.

I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement:

     This statement is false.

Also, would anyone like a MIDI version of Bach's Musical Offering?  (A bit
mangled, unfortunately... some notes are prolonged indefinitely beyond the
point at which they apparently ought to end.)

COE admitted. By the way, I hereby make and admit an equal COE on CFJ 971.

This means I will have to do the assignments again as well. According to
existing Game Custom I will do this in the following way: I roll a D20,
if it's 1-17 the assignment will stay as it was, an 18 gives Blob, a 19
Elde. This resulted in th following CFJs being reassigned:

948: Blob
966: Blob
975: Elde
977: Blob
983: Blob
987: Elde
989: Elde
1004: Elde
1014: Elde
1027: Blob

I will regard the 10 CFJs above as being assigned As of this message,
while the others will be regarded as assigned as of the previous message.

The relevant parts of the mail become:

(Caller's) Arguments:

======================================================================

Complete text of the mail in which the CFJ was called (I am obliged
to publish this with this CFJ, I think)

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby Call For Judgement on the following Statement:

     This statement is false.

No, this falls in under point 1565 (iv) in this case. The problem we have
been having is that there is no clause in 1565 for non-compliance of CFJ

H. CotC Andre!

In the matter of CFJ 963, I hereby dismiss the CFJ on the grounds
that logical reasoning, even with perfect knowledge, cannot show
whether the Statement is TRUE or FALSE. R1563 therefore requires me
to dismiss the CFJ. In addition, the Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules, and is therefore the CFJ is to be
dismissed under R1565(iii).  Nor, having obtained all the relevant
information, am I able to determine whether the Statement is true or
false. The CFJ is therefore also to be dismissed under R1565(vi).

I dismiss this statement on the grounds that after a reasonable
effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant information, no
determination can be made of the truth or falsity of its Statement.

I futher transfer one Kudo from Murphy, for wasting the Judge's
and the COTC's time, to Andre, because e's not paid enough. :)

It strikes me that the situation we have here is similar to the
paradox of self-amendment. If changes take place in a particular
order, how is it possible to amend the rule permitting amendment?
The ultimate answer is that we have to use the concept of legal
fiction. It seems to me perfectly reasonable to act as if the
enacting of a Proposal that eliminates and then restores an
entity does not, in fact, produce a time when there is no such
entity. Such an attitude may or may not be consistent with
strict formal logic. But it is eminently reasonable. I think one
would have to provide a very good reason to oppose this view.

Why?  I tend to agree with Scott here.  To paraphrase Suber, any Nomic
which enacts something like that deserves whatever it gets.  (Suber
was talking about amending or repealing 101.)

It's not that the Rules are ineffective; it's that the application of
a Proposal is an indivisible event.

And they are often subject to race conditions.  It might be that a
naive attempt to implement such a Rule (and I consider the suggested
Rule exceedingly naive) might get out of sync if a Proposal repealed
two Rules; the trigger may only be triggered once.  

(IMO, the Total Rule Count is a derived attribute of the Ruleset, and
if it needs to be used for some legal, it should be computed directly
from the Rules, rather than maintained separately from the Rules.)

But it seems to me that the rule bringing about the changes in
question only allows the other rules to decide if a provision can be
applied, it doesn't let them get their sticky hands all over the
state.  This is as easy to represent in a programming language as the
other possibility (pass the game state by value :-), if that's to
count for anything.

The distinction you see no reason to make is one that is implicity
made by the rule in question, which says that the change represented
by the proposal takes place to the maximal extent _permitted_ by the
rules.  If you like, the change calculation function can examine the
text of the rules without them actually having any purview. 

It's a question as yet undecided.  It will be interesting to see what
the Appelate Courts come up with.

I posit that is no more basis in the Rules for this contention than
there is for the atomicity contention, aside from ill-matched
arguments by analogy from the black art of computer programming.

I am reminded of the Suffusion of Yellow crisis on Rishonomic, as

time to time, do incredibly stupid things.  But no law can protect man

Even if 1527 does not state that all changes within a proposal take
place in an ordered fashion, that does not necessarily mean that
all changes must take place simultaneously.  (I use "simultaneously"
to mean both temporally and logically simultanously.)  The issue
is to be deicded by the appeal of CFJ 933.

Which is why I prefer simultaneity as the default, and allowing
proposals to specify an ordering (total or partial) instead
if they so desire.

Why do you believe this, other than having an aesthetic prefrence?
I can't think of any interpretation within the Rules that supports this
position, though it might be a good model for how we should rewrite the
proposal system to work-- as of right now, I don't see it.

That's quite a simplification; after all, you might loop up to Rule 6000, 
which disallows the change, but perhaps Rule 50 allows it and takes 
precedence. Or maybe you assume the disallows () subroutine takes care of 
this?

BTW, what is this 'od' thing? Is that 'do' backwards?  What language is 
that from? I'm confused...

And what is "a single change to the Game State?"

No, I'm not being facetious.

That's true; it *is* just a game, though. I might vote for a proposal 
like that just to see what happened! I don't play Nomic because I know 
what's going to happen -- it's those bizzare conundrums of logic and law 
that give Nomic its character and desirability as a game to play, at 
least to me.

BTW, anyone for repealing R101?   :)

We dealt with an issue like this in Rishonomic once, actually. 
Specifically, there was a Rule which amended a large number of other
Rules. In Rishon, there is no Rule describing the timing of such 
actions, and the resolution of a crisis hung on the judgement of this
issue. Antimatter and I both argued that, absent any other criteria,
simultaneous effect was the only logical way to interpret it, since
any other ordering has to come up with a reason to favor certain rules
over others, and any such ordering would be pretty much arbitrary. 
Other players argued things like "The Speaker should be able to apply
Rule changes in any order e wants," amazingly enough.

As it doesn't have retroactive effect, one would also
have to alter the Ruleset to take into account the
Proposals passed after PC. In other words, we'll need
an AI=3.1 proposal to do it all.

If all VTs *were* indeed destroyed, then we're all far more screwed than 
we realized. Very likely, every one of us would have some pretty significant

How about defining the Agora Time Quantum, with a small finite value? Might I
suggest the Planck time, whatever that is (around 10E-43 second, I
think). 

Stipulate that when a Proposal enacts multiple changes, the first occurs at
time T, the second at T+atq, the third at time T+2atq; etc.

I think the precedence system is basically non-computable - we once
discussed the possibity of precedence 'loops', in which Rule X takes
precedence over Rule Y which takes precedence over Rule Z which
takes precedence over Rule X.

Notions of precedence are however irrelevant to the system we're 
modeling as far as the matter of side-effects is concerned; the above 
implements a rudimentary notion of precedence, though, since it 
basically says 'restrictive rules with lower number always take 
precedence over permissive rules with higher number'.

> BTW, what is this 'od' thing? Is that 'do' backwards?  What language is

Most languages have block constructs, i.e. for (condition)
{do-block}. However, reserved words are just as suited to
terminating blocks, and because they obviate the need for an 
equivalent to the opening brace, whose place is taken by the loop 
statement keyword, they were once favored by programmers of an 
earlier age who believed in 'the fewer lines of code the better'.
And of course 'od' is a way of saying, 'this closes the "do" 
brace-equivalent'.

I only used it because I wanted to mimic Michael's usage; I'm 
actually more comfortable with Pascal- or C-like usage, and in fact 
I had to add a C++-inspired layer of object-oriented programming to 
Michael's own creation, which was probably inspired by shell 
scripting languages. (The "function(x,y) is" declaration style is, 
however, inspired by Eiffel.)

The language is of course an invented language, constructed on the 
spot to meet the requirements of the debate. This is how programmers 
have fun, I suppose. ;)

===
* The "Corruption" decree : the Player with the most Blots shall be
   installed into the Office of the Assessor.
* The "Exorcism" statute : Enact a Rule reading, "No Zombie, i.e. a
   Player who is not eir own Executor, shall be allowed to hold Office."

An artifical example, but this might have been distributed, say,
before Elde was deregistered with 9 Blots, and adopted after Elde 
became a Zombie (and doubled eir Blots). Package these two into a 
sweeping (but fun) Official Reform, and its being adopted, and the 
provisions therein overlooked, doesn't sound implausible.

Then again, pass-by reference is also a very common notion. What
arguments can you offer in support of the notion that the same Rules
that are invoked to determine a provision's effect could not also do
that kind of thing ?

Hm, I could very well imagine a Rule like the following :

* Whenever a Rule Change seeks to amend a Rule defining a Currency,
all units of that Currency shall be destroyed, and such a Rule Change 
shall be legal insofar as that occurs.

I.e., one which has to perform a computation with side-effects in
order to complete its test of a Rule Change's validity. If one can
conceive of such a Rule, I submit that one must interpret the Ruleset
in such a manner that this is possible, or, to put it in another way, 
a Rule such as the above would not on the face of it conflict with 
594 in any of its interpretations offered so far.

You'll recall that I apologized in advance for resorting to that
analogy with programming, which admittedly bears little relation to 
what Agora is about - the Rules are not a program, and neither is a 
Proposal.

For the same reason that some Agorans usually perceive a notion more
readily if couched in mathematical terms, though, it's often a good
way to explain a point to a particular subset of the Players.

Further, the Rules themselves embody a notion of 'state', which has
no counterpart in RL law that I know of (but then I'm not a
practitioner, or even a serious student, of RL law); it is this
notion that I believe gives rise to Michael's "Proposal-as-program",
and that's reason enough for me to pursue the analogy.

A telling point, which does not resort to such an analogy, is that it
is very easy to conceive of a Rule which requires some modification
of the game state as a consequence of a provision to be implemented
before a determination as to the legality of that provision can be
made.

Then again, I suppose that we could regard the game state as
obtained by this Rule's examination as being itself a legal fiction,
i.e. the game state resulting from the provision being examined would
be treated as a purely intellectual device, the basis for a
determination by the relevant Rule used merely to allow or disallow
the provision, and any effects arising from that determination held
off until all provisions had been implemented in the same restricted
way.

This strikes me as suspect on two counts, though; first, in that it 
calls for the construction of much more information than would be 
required if atomicity doesn't obtain - unnecessarily multiplies game 
states, one might say - and second, that it would result in 
provisions being allowed or disallowed based on 'virtual' game states 
which would possibly be dissimilar to the actual game state resulting 
from determining a Proposal's effects atomically.

Lastly, I believe that the notion of atomicity only pushes the 
problem back a little, without really solving it. Please imagine (and 
understand that this is merely a thought experiment, rather than a 
something I would consider Proposing) the following :

Proposal the First :
* Enact a Rule : "A Player who becomes Blue Wins.".
* Enact a Rule : "A Player who becomes Red Wins, unless another 
   Player is already Blue.".
* Enact a Rule : "When Player Wins, all Players lose their Color."

(Please note that this is very similar to the Win Token system with 
Win-preventing conditions, a situation that we have known in the 
past; this is not *purely* an intellectual construct with no 
relevance to actual game situations.)

Proposal the Second :
* Morendil becomes Blue
* Scott becomes Blue
* Zefram becomes Red

Even though the Color Rules were 'held in abeyance' until all
provisions of the second Proposal had been implemented, we would
still face the same kind of problems, namely, different orderings of 
its provisions taking effect cause different results, and their 
effects being unordered gives rise to a game state that cannot
be determined easily.

That might be a sound idea. Would put logical ordering and temporal

Well, a Rule Change is a change to the game state. And Rule Change
may only change individual Rules, and a Proposal may contain
multiple Rule Changes - so any theory of what constitutes a single
change to the game state had better account for that. IMHO, a single
change is what can effected by a single provision, which, I know, is
not a definite answer to the question...

In a Proposal like
* Rule X is repealed;
* Rule X is amended to "..."
* Morendil receives 10 VTs and 10 Indulgences from the Bank.
* Chuck is put On Hold.

I'd count 5 individual provisions, and would find suspect any
definition which counts only 3 (two Rule changes and one other game
state change). Then again, I'm not sure what should happen if the 
Bank only has 5 VTs at that time.

We haven't heard from Calabresi for a while. You might want to send
him some email directly informing him of his selection, given the
importance of the CFJ.

Calabresi registered on Aug 11, after the CFJ was called. Question:
does this mean that Calabresi was ineligible to Judge the CFJ when
it was called, and is therefore ineligible to serve as Justice under
R911(iv)?

As I see it, there is nothing in the Rules to support either position;
Game Custom appears to be equally silent (or, at least, inconsistent);
and there do not appear to be any prior Judgements that cast any
illuminating light either.  This leaves the resolution of the question
to "common sense and the best interests of the game".  I argue that
both of these factors favor the atomic interpretation.

In order to judge what "common sense" on this matter is, I point to
the recently expressed opinions of Kolja and Vir, both of whom are too
new to Agora to have been polluted with the peculiar notions of
reality that seem to overtake one's mind if one plays Nomic for too
long.  Both of them seem to be of the opinion that the the atomic
interpretation is more commonsensical than the timesliced
interpretation.  The opinions of the more seasoned Players seem to be
mixed; however, I note that at least one defender of the timeslicing
application seems to be arguing by analogy from computer programming.
I cannot consider a perspective that can be gained only through
experience in programming computers to be "common sense"; this
argument must therefore be demoted to the standing of "other
standards," in the sense of Rule 217.

I believe that Kolja's recently expressed opinions also sum up the
argument for atomicity being in the best interest of the game.  He
claims, and I concur, that the interruptible paradigm places a barrier
to effective participation for new Players by forcing new Players to
compose their Proposals in an unobvious, contorted fashion for them to
be able to take effect.  I consider the imposition of such barriers
to be very much opposed to the best interest of the game.  It does not
serve Agora (whose very name means "an open place") to have such
barriers.

It is therefore my opinion that a Judge, called upon to decide the
question of the atomicity of the application of Proposals, is obliged
by Rule 217 to find that Proposals are, indeed, applied atomically.

El yucko.  This would be a recordkeeping nightmare.  Furthemore, it
still permits simultaneous events, so it's not a solution, merely a

In fact there is custom to the contrary. Consider, as just one example,
Proposal 2628:

####
Proposal 2628 (Steve, AI=1)

A Win by Indirect Self-Reference II

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be Created, entitled "A Win By
Indirect Self-Reference II", with the following text:

      Upon the Creation of this Rule, the following events occur:

(i)   Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who cast
      exactly one vote FOR and no votes AGAINST the Proposal, proposed by
      Steve, the adoption of which resulted in the creation of the Rule
      entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" receives 3 Extra Votes
      from the Bank.

(ii)  Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who cast
      exactly two votes FOR and no votes AGAINST the Proposal, proposed by
      Steve, the adoption of which resulted in the Creation of the Rule
      entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" receives 5 Extra Votes
      from the Bank.

(iii) The Rule entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" is repealed.

(iv)  This Rule repeals itself.

      All transfers of Extra Votes which occur as a result of this
      Rule are detected and reported by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1561 be amended to read:

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

####

If we had truly thought the action of Rules is held in abeyance until
after all the provisions in the Proposal had taken effect, then we should
have had to argue that the amendment to R1561 actually prevented
parts of the rest of the Proposal from taking effect. Nobody actually
argued as such, nor do I think anybody should have been tempted to.
We quite properly assumed that the provisions take effect in order
and that the bribe is offered and paid before the Rules become such
so as to make that illegal.

There have been very few Proposals adopted since PC; retracing would
not be hard.  There have only been 17 Proposals since, not counting
those whose Voting Periods have not yet ended (or have not yet begun).

Yes.  Fortunately, the Chancellor cannot be deregistered for

Is the idea that nothing else could happen in between?
Does this solve continuity problems?

Why do you envision a problem with recordkeeping ? The only problems
I see with it are that it a) severely restricts the options of
Proposal authors and b) makes it impossible to use the 'feature' of
594 discovered by elJefe whereby a provision could specify its own
ordering or severability.

I do think it does. Only Players are eligible, so Calabresi was 
ineligible to Judge 933, presumably - and therefore e is not eligible 
to sit on the Appeal.

What do you mean, interfere? The rest of the Rules will be 'interefering'
all over the place, just in figuring out how to apply the provisions
in the Proposal! Rules about rule chsnges, about transfers, about
win conditions, about bribery, about protecting the Proposal system.
They all interfere.

That rule changes are atomic? Or that Proposals are? Neither commonsense
nor game custom support the view that Proposals are atomic. What
about Proposal 2628?

Proposal 2628 (Steve, AI=1)

A Win by Indirect Self-Reference II

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be Created, entitled "A Win By
Indirect Self-Reference II", with the following text:

      Upon the Creation of this Rule, the following events occur:

(i)   Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who cast
      exactly one vote FOR and no votes AGAINST the Proposal, proposed by
      Steve, the adoption of which resulted in the creation of the Rule
      entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" receives 3 Extra Votes
      from the Bank.

(ii)  Every Player, with the exception of Chuck and Steve, who cast
      exactly two votes FOR and no votes AGAINST the Proposal, proposed by
      Steve, the adoption of which resulted in the Creation of the Rule
      entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" receives 5 Extra Votes
      from the Bank.

(iii) The Rule entitled "A Win by Indirect Self-Reference I" is repealed.

(iv)  This Rule repeals itself.

      All transfers of Extra Votes which occur as a result of this
      Rule are detected and reported by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1561 be amended to read:

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Steve, Steve, Steve.  I expect better from you.  The fallacy in your
reasoning here is painfully obvious.  There are two parts to this
Proposal; one creates a Rule, the other amends Rule 1561.  By the time
Rule 1561 is amended such that it would bar the adoption of Proposal
2628, Proposal 2628 is already fully adopted.  Furthermore, nothing in
the amended Rule 1561 would disturb the application of the Rule
created by Proposal 2628; Rule 1561 as amended speaks to Proposals,
not to Rules already enacted.  

It is quite clear to me that the circumstances of Proposal 2628 do
_not_ provide any support in Game Custom for or against atomicity;
either interpretation gives the same result.

Without meaning any offense to either Kolja or Vir, 'common sense'
is not necessarily embodied by Players who are naive with respect to
Agoran matters. In fact, I suspect that precisely because of the
'pollution of minds' to which you refer, things that seem nonsensical
to new Players usually begin make sense soon after they get settled
in. Common sense does not necessarily equate with unreasoned,
instinctual reactions to situations and arguments that I doubt new 
Players are familiar with, unless of course they are law students.

Same objection - why should any profession be any more, or any less, 
representative of 'common sense' than any other ? In a way it makes 
good sense to think of Rules or Proposals as programs, or at least it 
helps in constructing arguments about them; they *are* not programs, 
but neither are they exactly similar to anything else - the Rules of 
Agora are uniquely themselves.

> I believe that Kolja's recently expressed opinions also sum up the

I dissent - I have good reasons to believe that adopting this
paradigm would lead to indeterminate game states, which is something
all Players dislike and that would seem difficult to claim is in the
best interests of the game.

I am also unconvinced that *any* sensible paradigm would make it any
easier (or more difficult) to write Proposals - writing complex
Proposals is inherently difficult, and in all cases one has to
exercise due caution in mapping out the consequences of their
provisions and the interplay between them.

It would be necessary to keep track of the quantum offset of certain
events, adding yet more data to be recorded.  I do not envy having to
count the number of provisions in a proposal merely in order to
determine the exact time at which a given event took place.

And, as I have noted, it does nothing to insure that no two events are
simultaneous.  What happens when someone sends two messages with
identical time stamps, for example?

However, the fact of Steve's fallacy is also a point scored against

Don't give up on me so easily, Morendil! It is Scott's reasoning that
is fallacious, not mine. He didn't read R1561.

Merely a minor problem of discovery, as we'll have to ascertain
which of these two messages was sent first, and in any case it is
extremely unlikely that two messages will ever be sent by different
people in such a way that the time-stamps will be identical down to
the second. In the case of a single person sending two messages in 
such quick succession that the timestamps are identical, it will be 
feasible to determine which was sent first; on some systems it will 
be the one composed first, on others some equally simple criterion 
will apply (for instance, my mailer, Pegasus, sends messages in 
batches in alphabetical order of Subject: header).

In nearly all cases (as close to the totality of cases as to make no 
difference), there will never be a problem with recordkeeping, as 
Planck's constant is so small that it would be impossible, or nearly 
so, to write a Proposal with so many provisions that the sum of the 
time quanta involved would exceed a fraction of a second - if we can 
distinguish, using mail headers, which message comes first, then we 
will be able to order events therein.

KoJen's suggestion does not give a resolution to the problem of 
atomicity, though.

Scott, Scott, Scott. I expect better from you. Read the amendment to
R1561. It does not prevent Proposals which offer bribes from being
adopted, it prevents them from taking effect *even if they are adopted*.

The effect of P2628 was to offer a bribe and to amend R1561 such that
the offering of that kind of a bribe by a Proposal does not take effect,
even if the Proposal is adopted. If we do not assume that the Rule
was created before the amendment to R1561 occurred, then we are not
entitled to assume that the creation of the Rule is not prevented from
taking effect by the newly amended R1561. What would entitle us to
make that assumption? On the other hand, if we do assume, as we actually
did in the case, that the Rule is created before the amendment occurs,
then the creation of the Rule cannot be blocked by the newly amended
R1561 - that would be a retroactive effect.

Before you were saying that you saw no reason not say that the 
application of the provisions in a Proposal took effect at the
same time but in order. Are you abandoning this position?

I don't think the claim that the adoption of a Proposal is an atomic
event will stand scrutiny.  You yourself have admitted that should a
Proposal happen to contain conflicting provisions, the Courts might
have to decide how to order them. But if the Courts impose any ordering
at all, atomicity will have been violated.

Right. Eg: R114, R1698, R1561, R1003.

I'm not interested in such analogies. I point instead to Rules 114
and R1698. The can act to block individual provisions in a Proposal
from taking effect. Therefore we have to think of them as testing
each provision as it attempts to take effect. Therefore it is the
provisions in a Proposal, not the Proposal itself, which are the
atoms of effectiveness.

End of story.

I don't understand. If R1698 blocks a certain provision in a Proposal
from taking effect, then that's going to have a big effect on the
game state. It might, for example, mean the difference between there
being VTs and there not being any. And subsequent provisions in
the same Proposal (eg taxes based on current VT holdings) might be
greatly affected by whether the earlier provision is blocked by R1698
or not. How much more sticky can hands get?

I do not believe that there is any argument from the difficulty
of Proposal writing to any conclusions about whether simultaneity
or total ordering should be adopted as the default. Writing complex
Proposals is inherently, and equally, difficult under either
assumption.

1586 was authored by Kelly in response to CFJs 815 and 816.

Here they are :

#######################################################################

   Assignment CFJ 815

the Rules governing the properties of any Game Entity, that all such
Game Entities have their properties changed to conform to the

#######################################################################

Argument:

There has been made an argument that since the Rules Governing Groups
have been amended substantially, that any Groups formed under the old
Rules cease to exist-- or at least cease to have any effect vis-a-vis
the Game of Agora.  It is my contention that there is nothing to
support this view, and in fact, the oft-referenced 1011 actually
forbids such an interpretation.

Before the adoption of 1760, there was a class of Entities known as
Groups the contention is that, since 1760 made wholesale changes to
the Entitie known as Groups, that the incompatibly-formed prior Groups
ceased to exist.

This is in direct contradiction with 1011!

>From 1011:

     Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

What Rule specifies the destruction of the old Groups?  None. 
Certainly the amendments in 1760 say nothing about repealing the legal
authority of prior Groups.  Any such diminishment of prior Groups is
an arbitrary change, wholly outside the authority of the Ruleset, and
therefore void.

And, since Groups themselves are still a defined Entity in the
Ruleset, and there was no period of time where Groups were not
defined, any alleged discontinuity is addressed by 1011.  The Rules
changed the way Groups were defined, therefore the Entities known as
Groups changed their properties, because that is the only option
specified by the Rules.

======================================================================

Arguments Judge:

I approach this CFJ with some trepidation, as it touches on
deep and largely unvisited areas of Agora metaphysics and
ontology.  The fact that it is a CFJ on the interpretation
of a specific Rule, though, limits its scope enough that I
have some hope of dealing adequately with the questions raised,
in this limited context.

The issues underlying the truth or falsehood of the Statement
concern the nature of the relationship between the Rules
of Agora and the rest of the Game state; in particular,
between the Rules that define and govern Game Entities and
instances of the Entities themselves, especially as the
Rules change over time.  The fact that the Rules do in
fact change over time complicates the relationship
enormously.

So what does in fact happen to an existing Game Entity when
the Rules that govern its properties (its nature, its
description, its relationship to the rest of the Game)
change?  The Statement requires us, in particular, to
consider whether or not the Entity changes to conform to
the amendment; that is, whether or not the Entity changes
in such a way that the new version of the Rules correctly
describes it.  There seem to be three possiblities here,
for any particular Entity and any particular Rule change:

 a) The Entity might remain unchanged, despite the change
    to the Rules.  This seems unlikely, though, as the
    Entity would then be in violation of the Rules; for
    a Platonist, this is flatly impossible, whereas for
    a Pragmatist it is at least a mistake.  While there is
    no Rule that explictly says that all Entities must
    conform to the Rules, such a Rule seems unnecessary:
    it is essential to the Rules being Rules that the
    Entities they create must at all times conform to them.
    So this possibility is not to be taken seriously.

 b) The Entity might change, so as to be in conformance
    with the new state of the Rules.  This seems relatively
    unproblematic.  For some Entities and some Rule changes,
    of course, the only change to the Entity that would
    bring it (or the Game state as a whole) into conformance
    with the Rules would be for it to cease to exist.  If,
    for instance, the Rules governing a particular Entity
    were to be amended so as to be completely different,
    and describe some other Entities with no properties in
    common with the Entities they previously defined (or
    to define no Entities at all), it would be foolish to
    place great weight on the simple fact of an unchanging
    Rule number.  Similarly, if all the Rules that provide
    for an Entity to exist at all are repealed without
    simultaneous replacement, the only permissible change
    would seem to be destruction. But in general, there will be
    some lesser change to the existing Entities that will bring
    them into conformance with the Rules while still
    allowing them to exist.

    Ideal Rule Changes will of course specify exactly
    what changes should occur to existing Entities to bring
    them into conformance with the new Rules for that
    type of Entity.  But where the Rules are silent on
    the issue, for whatever reason, the issue must be
    settled in some other way; by, for instance, the
    Courts (per Rule 217 and family), or simply the
    rational consensus of the Players.

 c) The Entity might simply cease to exist, or cease to
    be an Entity of the type that it formerly was, by
    virtue of the change to its governing Rules, despite
    the fact that a less-drastic change could have brought
    it into conformance with the new Rules.  There seems
    to be little reason to adopt this strategy, however,
    and a Judge called upon to decide on the fate of some
    pre-existing Entities in a case where the new Rules
    are silent on the issue of conformance-chanes would be
    well-advised to consider it only as a last resort, as
    suggested in the previous paragraph.

What light is thrown on the above musings by Game Custom and previous
Judgements?  Surprisingly little.  The Potato CFJ, for instance, which
at first seems relevant at least to the issue that led to this CFJ, is
in fact not relevant to the present Statement, since that case did not
involve a change to Rules that governed the properties of a
pre-existing Game Entity.  It was, in particular, the finding of the
Judge that there was no pre-existing Game Entity of the type governed
by the new Rule.  That case also involved a newly-created Rule, not an
amendment as the current Statement specifies.  The Judgement held that
a previously- existing Entity which had been given a particular name
by a Player acting within the Rules did not simply by virtue of this
name take on the properties of a similarly-named Entity later created
by a new Rule; this raises issues in the same general area as the
current question, but not close enough to shed any light on the
current Statement itself.

Game Custom clearly teaches that at least *some* of the properties of
an Entity are implicitly changed when the Rules governing those
properties are changed.  There are countless examples; Rules on Kudos,
Points, Marks, Contests, and so on have all been changed, without any
suggestion that the pre-existing Entities of that class should
therefore cease to exist.  At first glance, this might seem to give us
our answer without further effort, but while I think it is extremely
suggestive and helpful, it is not entirely final.  I have been unable
to find a very strong example of a deep and fundamental change to the
nature of a pre-existing Entity being caused by a change to the
governing Rule in the absence of a "grandfather" clause.  Such a
finding would have been conclusive that (b) above is the correct
consequence of even such deep changes.  On the other hand, I found no
cases on the other side, either, of Entities ceasing to exist when
they could have been changed instead.  So on balance (b) still seems
the heavy favorite.

Having determined, so far, that (b) seems correct, and that
the Rules and Game Custom (not to speak of common sense)
favor the truth of the dependant clause in the Statement,
what shall we make of the Statement as a whole?  Does the
truth of the dependant clause in fact rest on interpretation
of Rule 1011?

The Argument presented by the Caller deals mainly with the
application of the Statement to a particular issue that
is currently before the Agoran Public.  Since the statement
itself does not mention that issue, however, no Judgement
on the issue itself is required.  The Argument does,
however, illustrate how Rule 1011 comes into consideration.
It would be possible to interpret 1011 so as to prohibit
(b) above (that interpretation would also, as far as I
can tell, prohibit (c), and we'd be in a fine mess).  If
the correct interpretation of 1011 does prohibit (b),
then, the Statement should be judged FALSE.  Otherwise,
it is TRUE.

Under what circumstances would 1011 prohibit the changes
to Game Entities suggested in (b)?  1011 prohibits any
changes to certain types of Entity, if those changes are
caused "by any action other than those specified by the
Rules".  Could the changes suggested in (b) be a change
of the type thus prohibited?  The changes in (b) are
caused by a change to the Rules.  That isn't an action,
though, so since causation is transitive we continue to
follow the chain.  Changes to the Rules are caused by
various actions, and (by Rule 116) the only actions
which can cause changes to the Rules are actions that are
permitted by (which will do as a synonym for "specified
by" in this context) the Rules.  So: the actions which
cause the changes suggested in (b) are actions specified
by the Rules; therefore, Rule 1011 does not prohibit those
changes.  This, along with the considerations of Game
Custom and so on outlined above, lead us to conclude that
the Statement in this CFJ is TRUE.

   JUDGEMENT CFJ 816

   The Rules, generally, should be interpreted such that all Groups,

   Proposal 1760 ceased to exist upon the adoption of that Proposal.

  Assigned to Chuck, 26 Oct 1995, as of this message
  Judged FALSE by Chuck, 27 Oct 1995, 22:04 CDT

======================================================================

Arguments:

Prior to the adoption of Proposal 1760, Groups, Contests, and
Contracts existed by the virtue of their own empowering Rules (766,
1446, and 1455, respectively).  None of the existing entities was, in
any way, an Organization (since such things only came into being with
Proposal 1760).

Proposal 1760 amended Rules 766, 1446, and 1455 creating classes of
Organizations known as Groups, Contests, and Contracts.  However, no
part of Proposal 1760 in any way makes those entities which existed
prior to its adoption become Organizations.  The only method by which
an Organization can come into existence is that method specified in
the new Rule 1533/0.  None of the Groups, Contests, or Contracts in
existence prior to the adoption of Proposal 1760 comply with these
requirements, and therefore are not Organizations.  Since the
authorizing legislation for the existence of these Entities no longer
permits them to exist, they all cease to exist at the time of the
adoption of Proposal 1760.

Rule 1011 forbids the old Groups, etc., from becoming Organizations
except as specified by the Rules; they can't just do this magically.
So either they cease to exist, or at the very least they cease to be
be Groups/Contests/Contracts, because they lack status as
Organizations, and thus lose their Treasuries, and any right to cast a
Vote.

It is long-established Game Custom that when an Entity created by the
Rules ceases to have authority to exist under the Rules, then it
ceases to exist.  (Recall the Office of the Sweepstakes Officer.)

Prior Judgements also support this view.  CFJ 803 held that Rule 1488
(created by Proposal 1647) created a new entity ("The Nomic Potato")
regardless of the fact that Zefram had created a Contest called "The
Nomic Potato" during the Voting Period for the Proposal.

======================================================================

Reasons and Arguments Judge:

I question the value of presenting reasons and arguments, as
this Judgement is almost certain to be appealed, but I will
present them nonetheless.

Prior to the passage of Proposal 1760, Rules 766, 1446, and 1455
defined Groups, Contests, and Contracts, respectively.  After
the passage of Proposal 1760, Rules 766, 1446, and 1455
defined Groups, Contests, and Contracts, respectively.
The central question here is whether the Groups, Contests,
and Contracts after 1760 were continuous with those
before; or if there is no continuity, in which case
the Groups, Contests, and Contracts which existed
before 1760 ceased to exist with the adoption of 1760.

Let us first examine the general question: when an
Entity is redefined by an amendment, does the Entity
exist continuously, or is the Entity destroyed, and
a new Entity with the same name Created?  The Rules
provide no answer.  Game Custom?  Entities tend to be
considered continuous in most cases, but this is not always
the case.  In short, there is no general answer to this
question--it is a matter of magnitude of the redefinition
of the Entity.  Most redefinitions are insignificant enough
that there can be a continuity, but some are so major that
there can be no continuity.  It is correct, as some have
pointed out, that the fact that the name remains the same
does not automatically mean that the Entity is continuous.
However, it seems to me that there is a strong game
custom that if an Entity, being redefined, retains the
same name, then the Entity *is* continuous if a continuity
is at all possible.  After all, normally when an Entity
is redefined, we do not ask if it ceased to exist then
came into existence again; we naturally assume that it
did not.  So why is it questioned here?  Because it
seems as if the change to Groups, Contests, and Contracts
may have been so drastic so as to allow no continuity.  So
the question then becomes, can there be a continuity?

Let us first address the argument, which has been advanced,
that under the new Rules there can be only one each Group, Contest,
and Contract.  If correct, then I would agree that the nature of
Group(s), Contest(s), and Contract(s) has changed so radically as to
allow no continuity.

This argument rests on the first sentences of Rules 766, 1446,
and 1455.  The first sentence of Rule 766 reads, "Let there be a
Class of Organization known as a Group."  (The first sentences
of 1446 and 1455 are similar.)  Taken on its own, I *might*
agree that it implies there is only a single Group.  However,
the rest of the Rule *clearly* implies that there can be more
than one Group.  Thus, in that light, the natural interpretation
of that sentence is "Let there be a Class of Organization, the
members of which are known as Groups."  True, it could have been
worded more clearly, but even given this ambiguous wording, I
believe this is the proper interpretation.

The other argument advanced is that regarding the identity of
the "new" Groups as Organizations.  (In fact, it can be the only
argument advanced, as in all other respects "old" Groups are
essentially the same as "new" Groups.)  "Old" Groups were not
Organizations. "New" Groups are.  Thus, either the "old" Groups ceased
to exist, or the "old" Groups suddenly became Organizations.  Could
the "old" Groups suddenly become Organizations?

First, let us note that *if* "old" Groups suddenly became
Organizations, then Groups are continuous, as there is no
other obstacle to their continuity.  As I noted above,
given that the Entities share the same name, we must assume
they are continuous unless we can demonstrate otherwise.
Thus, to suggest that suddenly becoming Organizations prevents
any possible continuity is a circular argument at best, and
if we are to accept this argument, we must have some outside
reason why Groups cannot suddenly become Organizations.

Thus, we are presented with Rule 1011, which some allege prevents this
from taking place.  Does it?

Rule 1011/0 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname. (*Was: 450*)

"...may *not* be changed by any action other than those specified by
the Rules."

Is the action of Groups suddenly becoming Organizations specified by
the Rules?  Yes!  It is specified by the new Rule 766, which states
that Groups are Organizations.  It does not *explicitly* state that
Groups become Organizations, but this must be the case for Groups to
exist; as I noted above, given that the names are the same, we must
assume a continuity if at *all* possible within the Rules; that leads
us to this conclusion, i.e. that existing Groups do suddenly become
Organizations upon the adoption of 1760.

It has been suggested that the word "specified" necessarily means
"explicitly specified."  This argument is absurd; it can just as well
mean "implicitly specified."  There are numerous changes which occur
every day which are not explicitly specified; and thus there is a
strong Game Custom that 1011 does not mean that changes must be
*eplicitly* specified.  I will give just one example: let's look at
Rule 790, specifying the method of filling vacant Offices:

Rule 790/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      If, for any reason, an Office is vacant, that fact shall be
      announced by the Electioneer.  The Electioneer shall be the
      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      rule applies to Offices in general, and thus defers to Rules for
      specific Offices. (*Was: 689*)


Note it says, "that Player shall become that Officer."  It does
not explicitly say the Office is filled.  Naturally, it does *imply*
the Office is filled--and very clearly so--but it does not state so
explicitly.  Here is an example of an implicit change--the change in
the Office from a vacant state to a filled state--but no one would
suggest that the change does not take place because it is not
explicitly stated, even given Rule 1011.  Innumerable implicit changes
take place like this every day.  They are usually so obviously
*implicit* in the Rules that we do not even consider to question them.
 To interpret 1011 in the manner suggested by some would be absurd,
chaotic, and most importantly, against Game Custom.

In conclusion, there can be a continuity between "old" Groups
and "new" Groups; since there can be a continuity, and the
Entities have the same name, we must conclude that there *is*
a continuity; thus, Groups suddenly became Organizations upon
the adoption of 1760, as implied by Rule 766.  (Similar
arguments apply to Contests and Contracts.)

True! I don't think that'll be necessary in this case though. We've
passed only 3 (?) Proposals since P3533 passed? The Assessor and
Herald will have a heap of work to do. If it's just too much to even
think about, then we might try a high AI solution.

That issue was subtly different to the one we're dealing with here,
though. In Rishon, rule changes like "change every number in the Ruleset
to the phrase 'A Suffusion of Yellow'" are legal. In Agora, you'd
have to be more specific than that about precisely which Rules are
being changed. In being more specific, you'd have to provide a list,
and this list could be used as the basis of a non-arbitrary ordering,
if it were thought that an ordering were required.

So we shouldn't seek to write laws which make it more difficult 
for people to suffer from their own stupidity? Nonsense! Complete
protection from our stupidity is, as you say, impossible, but attempts
can and should still be made.

Isn't R1698 just such a law?

We don't need to imagine crazy Proposals being adopted - we know it
can happen. 'A Suffusion of Yellow' was adopted by Rishonomic. Now
I suppose some of you are sitting back smugly and thinking "but *we'd*
never do anything as crazy as *that*". Yeah, right. Black Repeals,
anyone?

I like the second one, myself. There's a third possibility, which is 
to hunt down and change all rules which trigger on some condition to 
only trigger on a *finite* time, but that also causes work for 
proposal authors (on a different subset of proposals).

I read the new version of Rule 1561 that's in the Proposal 2628.  I
will admit that I did not read the version of Rule 1561 that prevailed
prior to the adoption of Proposal 2628.  Do you contend that this
matters?

Not in the least.  The indivisibility of the adoption of a Proposal is
unrelated to the ordering of the application of the provisions in the
Proposal.

It is clear that you do not understand what Michael and I mean by
atomicity.  The ability to sever inapplicable provisions does not
impair the atomicity of the Proposal.

Ah.  You are confusing the question atomicity with the question of
ordering.  Please reread what Michael and myself have had to say about
atomicity; it is a totally distinct matter from ordering.  

There are only two Rule Changes in Proposal 2628; this makes the
discussion of whether atomicity makes a difference in this case quite
simple.  It does not.  The only ways that it could make a difference
is if the application of the first Rule Change in Proposal 2628 would
trigger some chain of events which would interfere with the
application of the second Rule Change.  There is clearly no such
possible chain of events consequent to the enactment of the first Rule
Change that would interfere the second.  Therefore, the determination
that Proposal 2628 was fully adopted lends no support either for or
against the theory of atomic Proposals.

Proposal 2628. On the view that the adoption of a Proposal is an atomic
event that cannot be broken down further into the adoption of its
provisions in some order or other, the amendment to R1561 would have
blocked the bribe offered earlier in the Proposal from taking effect.
Actually it's worse than that. The atomic view leads straight to paraodox:
the amendment to R1561 is effective if and only if it is not effective.

In any case, the atomic view of Proposals is unsustainable in light
of Rules like 114 and 1698. These can block individual provisions
within a Proposal. Therefore, we have to think of them as testing
each provision in the Proposal as it attempts to take effect. This
demolishes the atomic view. In fact, I remember quite clearly a
conversation I had with Scott during the last big debate we had about
Rule 114 (the debate which led me to write R1698), and he elaborated
to me precisely this view of the operation of Rule 114, and of the
proposed R1698. His position now flatly contradicts that earlier and
much more sensible view.

CFJ 920 is of interest here. In his Judgement, Antimatter Judged
TRUE on the grounds that waiting a determinate amount of time is
a Player action. But in his final remarks, he did defend the atomic
view:

      It is my opinion that this Statement should be Judged TRUE. 
      Not only is waiting for a definite time interval quite clearly
      an action, but it is also in the best interests of the game for
      it to be possible to make extensive Rule Changes in one
      Proposal without having to check that each intermediate state
      satisfies 114. 

I think the examples adduced in the current discussion show that this
conclusion was premature. Simultaneity can get you into trouble just
as easily as total ordering of events.

Hey! Sure, they may spend a lot of the day cleaning the stables, and
those home-stitched clothes are a bit goofy looking, but... oh.

I don't think that analogy really captures the point that Kolja A. is
trying to make. A better one for the current problem might be trying
to cook in a situation where all one's ingredients have the small but
discrete possibility of reacting to each other and exploding.

You know what they (Douglas Adams, to be specific) say: (paraphrased)
Those who attempt to make something completely idiot-proof underestimate
the ingenuity of complete idiots.

R1698 seems, to me, to be more for protection from accidents or 
sloppiness -- not actual stupidity, although it might help curb
that somewhat as well.

Steve> Right. Eg: R114, R1698, R1561, R1003.

These Rules determine whether a provision may be applied.  In my
opinion, the Proposal is "screened" by Rules such as 114 and 1698
prior to the implementation of any of the provisions therein, and
provisions which are found infringing are disregarded (or, if the
Proposal opts for inseverability, the Proposal itself is disregarded)
as being unpermitted by the Rules.  Rules 1561 and 1003 deal with
Proposals as a whole, and if the Proposal infringes either of these
Rules, it is disregarded before it even gets a chance to be applied.

I don't see why the examination cannot be made prior to all of the
provisions being applied, and then the provisions which survive the
screening are then applied.  Either interpretation, in my opinion, is
compatible with the Rules.

To the extent that they can individually be severed from the Proposal,
this is true.  This does not relate to the issue of the timing of
collateral effects of the application of those provisions, however.

Steve> End of story.

Not in the least.

This is not what I mean by atomic.  The Proposal is clearly separable
into its constitutent provisions; Rule 594 as much as says so.  What
is atomic is the implementation of those provisions not severed.

Not at all.  Not that this should surprise me; those who have known me
for a long enough time know that I have changed my views on several
matters regarding Nomic, some almost diametrically.

I recall that way back when we had the Walrus scam, the argument
was made (and, even stranger, rendered as a Judgment) that the
Walrus Marks couldn't have had their effects as they existed for
only an infinitesimal amount of time, resulting in certain quantum
mechanical effects. I believe Oerjan was one of the authors of this
line of reasoning. Since this is now judicial precedent, I invite
Oerjan to expound on the quantum mechanical effects of not having
a Mintor for an infinitesimal amount of time, in order to make
things even more silly.

Hm, Thinking about it some more, it's not the atomic view which leads
to paradox. You can get the same paradox on my view, too. Even if we
think of the bribe as taking effect strictly before the amendment,
the amendment is still part of the Proposal's taking effect, and
we can't have the Proposal taking effect before the Proposal takes
effect. My conclusion is that P2628 is another example of the paradox
of self-amendment. Which is interesting, but shows nothing either way
in the current discussion.

Well, I'm not so sure about that, but I'll let it pass for now.

Right. For decisive cases, we need to look at the operation of Rules
like 114 and 1698.

There is still another kind of atomicity that can be in effect which has the
effect Scott envisions and is not disproved by Steve's example.  Let me try to
explain by giving two different algorithms I see as possible here:

1)  While list of provisions is not empty
        If rules allow first provision in list to be enacted
            Calculate new game state as result of direct changes
            Calculate new game state caused by indirect changes.
        end-if
        Loop on rest of list.
    end-while

2)  While list of provisions is not empty
        If rules allow first provision in list to be enacted
            Calculate new game state as result of direct changes.
        end-if
        Loop on rest of list.
    end-while
    Calculate new game state caused by indirect changes.

I think 2) is what Scott probably has in mind.  Direct changes are those
explicitly stated in the provision (a rule change, the effects described by the
rule in the provision's rule change, any direct manipulation of properties in
the provision).  Indirect changes are those caused by the firing of other rules
as a result of the direct changes.  In Steve's example, the direct changes
(creating a rule that pays out bribes on enactment) would have occurred prior
to the direct change of the last provision (preventing proposals with bribes
from taking effect).

To me, it seems that 2) may be prevented by R101, if we interpret it to mean
"obey all Rules at all [logical] times".  By that I mean that we must obey all
the Rules even while enacting a logical ordering of simultaneous events.  Other
than this consideration, I haven't seen any example yet that forces one
interpretation over the other.  Glad I'm not on the appeals court.  8)

Firstly, I'll concede that R1561 and R1003 aren't relevant here for
the reasons you give. It's the operation of R114 and R1698 (and rules
like them which speak to the effectiveness of individual provisions)
which are the crucial ones to this discussion.

So: you claim that Proposals are screened by such Rules, and then any
surviving provisions are implemented atomically, as you put it.  I
have two objections. Firstly, what justifies the claim that this is
how these Rules operate, rather than the counter-claim that each
provision is tested in turn, then applied in turn? More seriously
though, is this reading actually consistent with the language
employed by Rules 114 and 1698?  Both Rules say that 

      Any change to the game state which would result in this
      condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take place...

This suggests to me that the test is applied *at the moment of
effectiveness*, ie, each provision is tested in turn just as it is
about to 'take place'. 

Actually, the wording is a little in tension with itself. The sentence
beings with a hypothetical construction ('would result') but ends
with an indicative construction ('is cancelled'). Weird. I wrote R1698,
but I just copied Zefram's construction in R114. I never noticed this
tension before.

There are two different ways we could resolve this tension:

Counterfactual reading:

      Any change to the game state which would, if it were applied,
      result in this condition becoming false, is not applied and
      does not take place.

Factual reading:

      Any change to the game state which, when applied, results in
      this condition becoming false, is cancelled and does not take
      place.

Where this leaves us, I don't know. It's beginning to look like a
stalemate. Fortunately, there are odd number of Justices.
