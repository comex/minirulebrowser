The above sentence is implicitly multiple POs, each specifying exactly
one source entity.

As far as I can see, since no Referendum has been held, the Ambassador
is permitted (reading R116 broadly as we Agorans are wont to do) to 
vote howsoever he pleases.

I's like to see him vote FOR.

I'm not sure that a different wording of R116 is needed to get out what
you call the exclusive meaning. It seems reasonable to me to read the
requirement that "changing the rules...is permitted only when a rule or
set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it." as meaning that
changing the rules is permitted only by means explicitly or implicitly
permitted by the rules. According the hypothesis under discussion, 
changing the rules of the Initial Set is permitted only by means of
adopting Proposals, so your Rule 301 *would* be prevented from taking
effect by Rule 103.

But again, that is exactly the point I am going toward.  Any attempt to say
"Mark gains X Blots" is an order to issue a PO would be the equivalent of
saying that anytime the judge says "John is sentenced to 10 years in
prison", the poor guy gets another 10 years.  Obviously, there must be more
to make that statement an order.  However, there were several posts to the
effect that "Mark gains X Blots" is in fact an order without any mention of
the context in which that statement would be regarded as such.  "Mark gains
X Blots" is at best ambiguous.  The best that can be said of it is that it
might be an order.  Obviously, in the right context the statement can be
seen as an order but note that it is the context that makes it so not
anything in the statement itself.  It is therefore the context of such a
statement that must be examined not the statement itself.

This is something that could still be challenged - some of the issues
with P/C that are currently being adressed date back right to the
time when P/C was adopted. 

I am beginning to be annoyed, in fact, with your and Crito's recent 
insistence that just because some act went unchallenged for a few 
days, or a few weeks, that act has the force of game custom.

Agora has been particularly lively in recent times, and I would
wager that most of us have no time to focus closely on more than two
or three of the dozen-odd interesting issues that are being
discussed in a-d. Of these, something like five or six arose from
P/C alone; I'll grant unchallenged acts the force of game custom
when we have had sufficient time to thoroughly examine recent
activity, but doing it now is premature.

I still consider myself to be under 1738's provision for stay of
execution as far as Blob and Elde are concerned. Most of the POs
that I have had to consider have been and are disputed.

Insofar as I am not opposed to the use of legal deeming, I naturally
think it possible for any kind of message to be legally equivalent
to any other kind of message.

For what it's worth, I, like Oerjan, think that Indulgences should
behave as a closed system, as originally proposed.  Your Friar
occupation might be viable as someone who simply gets a better chance
of receiving the Indulgences through the random redistribution. 

(This is just like the Church building feature in the much-touted Plots
 proto.  Incidentally, is someone going to propose this thing ever?  If
 it doesn't happen sometime soon, or if someone doesn't explain to me
 why it shouldn't, I'll propose the last Proto that was posted.  In
 other words, get a move on!)

Michael.

The above sentence is implicitly multiple POs, each specifying exactly
one source entity.

As far as I can see, since no Referendum has been held, the Ambassador
is permitted (reading R116 broadly as we Agorans are wont to do) to 
vote howsoever he pleases.

I's like to see him vote FOR.

I'm not sure that a different wording of R116 is needed to get out what
you call the exclusive meaning. It seems reasonable to me to read the
requirement that "changing the rules...is permitted only when a rule or
set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it." as meaning that
changing the rules is permitted only by means explicitly or implicitly
permitted by the rules. According the hypothesis under discussion, 
changing the rules of the Initial Set is permitted only by means of
adopting Proposals, so your Rule 301 *would* be prevented from taking
effect by Rule 103.

But again, that is exactly the point I am going toward.  Any attempt to say
"Mark gains X Blots" is an order to issue a PO would be the equivalent of
saying that anytime the judge says "John is sentenced to 10 years in
prison", the poor guy gets another 10 years.  Obviously, there must be more
to make that statement an order.  However, there were several posts to the
effect that "Mark gains X Blots" is in fact an order without any mention of
the context in which that statement would be regarded as such.  "Mark gains
X Blots" is at best ambiguous.  The best that can be said of it is that it
might be an order.  Obviously, in the right context the statement can be
seen as an order but note that it is the context that makes it so not
anything in the statement itself.  It is therefore the context of such a
statement that must be examined not the statement itself.

This is something that could still be challenged - some of the issues
with P/C that are currently being adressed date back right to the
time when P/C was adopted. 

I am beginning to be annoyed, in fact, with your and Crito's recent 
insistence that just because some act went unchallenged for a few 
days, or a few weeks, that act has the force of game custom.

Agora has been particularly lively in recent times, and I would
wager that most of us have no time to focus closely on more than two
or three of the dozen-odd interesting issues that are being
discussed in a-d. Of these, something like five or six arose from
P/C alone; I'll grant unchallenged acts the force of game custom
when we have had sufficient time to thoroughly examine recent
activity, but doing it now is premature.

I still consider myself to be under 1738's provision for stay of
execution as far as Blob and Elde are concerned. Most of the POs
that I have had to consider have been and are disputed.

Insofar as I am not opposed to the use of legal deeming, I naturally
think it possible for any kind of message to be legally equivalent
to any other kind of message.

For what it's worth, I, like Oerjan, think that Indulgences should
behave as a closed system, as originally proposed.  Your Friar
occupation might be viable as someone who simply gets a better chance
of receiving the Indulgences through the random redistribution. 

(This is just like the Church building feature in the much-touted Plots
 proto.  Incidentally, is someone going to propose this thing ever?  If
 it doesn't happen sometime soon, or if someone doesn't explain to me
 why it shouldn't, I'll propose the last Proto that was posted.  In
 other words, get a move on!)

Michael.

But the rules still allow new VTs to be created, and require their 
distribution, right?  Chris should have received a few for registering as a 
new player; e could vote for a proposal and if sufficient other players 
declare presence, it would pass.

I had done that before after asking my roommate, but I only now realize

I don't see why these two things should not be separate. I think
it would be better to give the possibility to Appeal Judgements
to Lawyers, or maybe Justices. Furthermore, the word 'Senator' already
has a meaning in the Ruleset.

I think it would be good to have the Speaker have 3 Occupations, but
obliged to be Huckster and Justice of the Peace. Likewise the CotC
and the Justiciar should be obliged to be JotP. Maybe we also should
have Officers be Hucksters, but in that case it seems reasonable to
give the CotC and the Justiciar a third one too. And while we're at
that, maybe we want even more...

What about 'Certain Players can be obliged to have certain Occupations.
A Player may have at most 2 Occupations, or 1 more than the number e
is obliged to have, whichever is more,' and then:

- Each Officer, and the Speaker, are obliged to be Hucksters
- The CotC, Justiciar and Speaker are obliged to be Justices of the Peace

and maybe:

- The Promotor is obliged to be Senator
- The Assessor is obliged to be Assemblyman
- I would like to make the CotC obliged to be Lawyer, but that might
  not be such a good idea as that gives em a third obliged Occupation.

I would think that Rule 114's concept of "some combination of Player
actions" is equally appropriate for this Rule, which means that limiting
our options in this way is not useful for deciding whether Rule 1698
"triggers".

I don't see your problem. Why can't we have both at the same time? There
is little in the Occupations proto that would conflict with the currency
ideas, IMO. A problem I see with Occupations is, that it might need a larger
community than Agora to really work.

Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

No VTs are created for the purpose of giving them to Chris.  The
Chancellor can elect to create VTs at any time, but is under no

I'm not playing any other Nomics, so, yes, I would consider it a bit
strange to see such Kudo transfers happen. Maybe if the Agora player
did something in another Nomic that is related to Agora - incite a
war, slander us... But for things completely unrelated to Agora, Kudo
transfers would be more appropriate at the InterNomic level, I'd say.

What, exactly, is an infinitesimal time for such game purposes,
aynway? My introductory maths lectures were long ago, but the feeling
I have is that, for the purposes of timing in a game like Agora,
"infinitesimal" should mean that the _extension_ of this time is
negligible (not small, but absolutely and totally negligible -
otherwise it wouldn't be infinitesimally small, but only "very" small
or something), while events that are separated by infinitesimal times
still happen in a clearly defined _order_. And this ordering effect is
all the infinitesimal times are needed for.

In that sense I would argue that VTs only ceased to exist because the
PC rules forgot to define a mintor for them. Had PC defined one, the
VTs would have survived - there would have been no (finite) time when
they were without a mintor.

I think that if you consider a rule as that proposed by Steve
necessary then you don't agree with my idea of infinitesimal; but then
I think there is something seriously wrong in the timing rules -
"ininitesimal" is then yet another word that is not used in our rules
in its RL meaning, and in addition its use in the rules fails to do
what it is supposed to do.

I would rather solve such a problem by using infinitesimal in a proper
way, not by adding patches to the rules.

As far as I can see the Rules are silent about the
current situation; R1632 certainly doesn't say that the Ambassador
shall vote FOR an INP if *and only if* there is a Referendum result
in its favour.
<<

This is exactly what I was suggesting as a solution to the
problem. However, from several responses to my suggestion I am now
convinced that, while clearly the referendum is not FOR or AGAINST INP
347, so the Ambassador is not forced to vote for or against by 1632,
it is still correct to describe the referendum (which never happened)
as undecided, so e _is_ forced to abstain by the very last sentence of
1632.

Don't tell me I have to change my mind again, now it's too late to
vote on IN 347!

Um, PC defined the Bank as Mintor for VTs.

I am in complete concurrence with this opinion.  When Elde's Judgement
is published, I intend to appeal it.  (Has it been published already?)

To be honest, I have expected complications like these since I first
read the bit about delayed TOs. I'm glad Crito is taking it so well,
but I'm still not sure whether this possibility to have stacks of
delayed TOs that wait for each other, cntradict or preempt each other
is a bug or a feature. It would be fun to start a circular series of

I'd say that there is a lot of _dealing_ indulgences going on - which

I wouldn't say so - the original judgement of the CFJ avoided awarding
a win by pitchfork due to the presence of the sentence      

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

It would have been nice to leave the sentence you deleted until the
one quoted above disappeared - then we might have had a real win by
pitchfork. 

Oh well, it was fun, anyway.

In my opinion this should be answered 'yes'. As long as there is some way
to adopt Proposals, 1698 does not fire, whether or not that method is
used.

Furthermore, the Players still have the possibility to Impeach the
Chancellor, to name just one possibility.

However, I'd like to urge you to mint some new VTs soon, so they get
in circulation quickly. We've had many complaints about the low number
of proposals recently; now I guess there will be quite a large bunch
coming up as soon as the Voting Period rule is disinfected - provided
we have valid VTs to vote with. I'd rather not propose anything just
to see the vote made invalid because the VTs used didn't really exist.

So I would like to repeat my suggestion to try this plots thing out
first in the context of an Agoraverse subgame (a contest) - make it as
much of a simulation of "All of Agora plus plots" as possible, e.g. by
using the general rules as far as possible (for proposing changes to
the contest regulations etc), replacing items like VT notes by
Agoraverse VT notes etc that work only within the contest and don't
interfere with the rest of Agora, and in general having lots of fun
with it there.

I guess that would be the best way to persuade sceptics that it works,
after all (or a way to find out that it doesn't).

I don't think anyone's disputing that it is important to consider the 
context of the statement. In fact, I kind of thought that was what *I*

In my opinion this should be answered 'yes'. As long as there is some way
to adopt Proposals, 1698 does not fire, whether or not that method is
used.
<<

In addition, the refusal of the Chancellor to do what is necessary to
make the adoption of proposals happen is not conceptually different
from the refusal of a majority of players to vote on proposals,
killing proposals by quorum. In both cases it's not the rules that
make adopting proposals impossible, but the way people play.

The potential problem I see is this.  To me, Occupations would not be very
interesting if everyone settled down into their two or three occupations and
just stayed there.  The kind of currency scarcity that we want to establish to
make Currencies interesting might make it harder to change jobs.  Not that
there aren't ways to make both work and be interesting at the same time, just
that I expect it to be harder to work out the kinks of both at the same time
rather than one at a time.

I haven't seen it yet. OTOH I remember quite well adressing the issue
of infinitesimal durations on a-d a few days ago when I posted my query
for arguments regarding 933; my position is that an 'event' such as VTs
becoming Mintor-less can have zero duration and still trigger a Rule
calling for something to happen as a result of that event.

I respectfully disagree. This is something that came up a while back
and I think I remember the flavor of the arugment. So let's try to
get back to the basics; Rule 1527 reads :

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

What does this say ? IIRC, this : if, in the same message,
sentence A has a given effect (e.g., amending one Rule) and sentence
B has a given effect (say, amending a different Rule), and sentence B
appears just after sentence A in the message, then, for any small period
of time, t, that you care to name, we can claim that the time tA (when
A 'was sent', or took effect) and the time tB (when B took effect) are
such that t > tB-tA > 0. That is, B occurs later than A, but no later
than a period t after A occurs, *however small* we choose t. (Anyway,
that is how I understand infinitesimals work - somebody correct me if
I am in error, I'm not a mathematician...)

In non-mathematical terms, I take this to mean that nothing can occur
*in between* A and B; but it certainly does not prevent things from
happening *at* tA or *at* tB, and by the above inequalities, anything
that occurs at tA occurs before anything that occurs at tB.

Let us take A to be "The Mintor of VTs shall cease to exist" and B
to be "The Mintor of VTs shall be the Bank". The actual 'communications
in Proposal 3533 were slightly different but are demonstrably equivalent
to these formulations; also IIRC a few other 'communications' were
interleaved between 3533's equivalent of A and B, but if my reasoning
holds when A and B are immediate neighbors it holds when they are more
widely separated.

Rule 1579 states :

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.  All Players have Mint Authority.

This does not specify when the destruction occurs, but I currently
conceive of no argument that it could occur *later* than the earliest
possible time at which the condition is satsified. That earliest
possible time is, in the above notation, tA, which is earlier than
tB.

Therefore, the Bank became Mintor of VTs *after* VTs were destroyed -
QED.

Since we do have that nasty "standard mathematics" Rule, it might be an
idea to tell what "infinitesimals" actually means in standard mathematics.

Like so many other terms, it can mean different things dependent on which
subpart of mathematics you are working.

Now for an ironic (and possibly ominous) fact: the part of mathematics
that will usually come to mind is called "NON-standard analysis".

Briefly: You start with your standard real numbers, and then you use some
heavy logic techniques to build a new, larger model of the real numbers
which contains the old one as a proper subset. The numbers that weren't
there to begin with are called non-standard.

The new model fulfils in a sense every theorem about the real numbers that
can be formulated without using set theory. So you have addition,
multiplication, trigonometry, etc. etc. The "without set theory" part is
important, otherwise the new model could not be larger than the old one.

What are the infinitesimals? These are the non-standard real numbers with
the property that they are closer to zero than all the standard ones
(except 0 itself.)

Unlike Morendil's intuition, there will be other such numbers between any
two of them, even if they are infinitesimally close. After all, there is a
(standard) theorem that between any two real numbers there is a third one,
and this has to carry over.

Greetings,
rjan.

What I mean by "plenary" is that one Indulgence is enough to wipe

I haven't seen it yet. OTOH I remember quite well
adressing the issue
of infinitesimal durations on a-d a few days ago
when I posted my query
for arguments regarding 933; my position is that
an 'event' such as VTs
becoming Mintor-less can have zero duration and
still trigger a Rule
calling for something to happen as a result of
that event.

If I had said "all are commanded" you would probably be right, since that would
be ambiguous whether it meant all as a group or all individually.  However,
since I said "each is commanded", it is clear, IMO, that this is shorthand for
six individual commands, each with one source, one destination, one Currency
and an exact number of units.  Feel free to CFJ this.  I don't consider the
above statement to actually put anything in dispute.  It does not look like a
COE to me.

Looks like it.  8)  I never understood why Players voted down the proposal to

BUS: COE: Re: OFF: Herald's Report as of 22 September 1997

First I also note that the current set of POs in the Heralds Report of Sept 22
are misnumbered, in that there are two POI105's.  This is a COE.  I hereby
admit this claim.  The relevant part of the message should have read:

POI101  09/22/97 as of this msg     1     Bank         Harlequin    Herald
POI102  09/22/97 as of this msg     1     Bank         G. Chaos     Herald

Yes, but in this case I don't think we really have to worry about what numbers
are "next" to or between any other numbers.  If we establish that the Mintor of
VT's ceased to exist at any point in time (point in the mathematical sense),
which I think we have, and we establish that R1579's "If the Mintor of a
Currency ceases to exist..." describes an instantaneous event (this may be
arguable) that causes VTs to be destroyed, then there would be no question as
to whether VTs were destroyed, whatever definition of "infinitessimal" we use.

This situation revolves around standard mathematics concept of continuity of
functions, it seems to me.  It is certainly possible for a function to be
discontinuous at a single point.  Let t1 be the instant in time where the Mint
was destroyed and t2 be the instant in time that the Bank was established as
the Mintor of VTs.  If we accept that game custom establishes infinitessimal,
by whatever definition, amounts of time separating the actions required to
implement a proposal (I find nothing in the Rules to require this), then t2 is
strictly greater than t1.  Using standard mathematics, as Oerjan points out
above, you can then find a time t3 such that t1 < t3 < t2.  So the function
which describes VTs Mintor is discontinuous at t3, no matter how close t1 and
t2 are to each other and VTs are destroyed at t3 since they have no Mintor at
t3.

The claimed destruction of VTs during the PC reform supposedly
occurred because the various rule changes included in the PC proposal
became effective at different times, separated by infinitesimal times.

However, after rereading the relevant rules (1527 and 376) I tend to
think that all rule changes in one proposal take place at the same
time. Probably many of you will disagree, but I'm not sure why.

1527, the rule that introduces the concept of events just separated by
infinitesimal intervals, talks of different items in one
message. Then, the above VT destruction argument implicitly supposes
that the document is the proposal, and the various items are the
various rule changes in the proposal.

However, really the message that is relevant to cause rules to change
because a proposal is adopted is the "first message sent by the
Assessor to reach the Public Forum announcing the results of the
voting on that Proposal" (376). This message does not necessarily
contain the full text of the proposal; if it does have several items,
these items will be the results of the votes on different proposals,
not the different rue changes that may form oneproposal. And in this
latter case, all "such Proposals shall take effect at the same time,
but in order by increasing Proposal Number" - this is a timing
provision that differs from (and due to lower rule number takes
precedence over) the one in 1527.

So all proposals whose vote results are announced in one message take
effect simultaneously. Why should 1527 then split each of these
proposals into several slices (one for every rule change)? What is the
"message" 1527 is referring to in this case? The Assessor's
publication of the voting results? No, that may not even include the
text of the proposal. Or the original proposal? But in which sense is
it a "message" that takes effect as the proposal's adoption is
published?

In fact, I strongly suspect (anyone of the veterans want to give me a
history lesson here?) that the wording of 376, "take effect at the
same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number" is what the
"infinitesimal time difference" concept in 1527 intended to implement
for all messages with several items. Ok, 1527 may not actually do so
(I found Morendil's careful argumentation a good support for this),
and in Agora rules the wording counts rather than the intention. But
in the particular case of rule changes caused by the adoption of a
proposal the timing is governed by 376 where the words and the
intention are in accord. So we may be left with some VTs after all.

When I reread the Rules, I noticed the same thing.  "Infinitessimals" only seem
to apply to actions within a single message, not necessarily to actions that
happen while a proposal is taking effect.  I seem to recall in a previous
argument, however, that there is case law someplace that has established the
use of infinitessimal time separations for actions during proposal enactment as
well.  I'm sure the veterans will be able to supply us with the exact
references.

With the possible exception of your underpaid CFJ, you mean Mils. There is

I don't think Rule 897 recognises non-Players' barring, by the way.

Provided the judges consider the statements to be relevant to the 
Rules, which I think they are. Anyone who disagrees can dismiss and 
recieve 3 Mil instead of 1 VT, of course :-)

I do think there's other game custom about the way Proposal and CFJ
distributions have been handled which shows that reposts of moves don't
have the effect making the move twice.

Still? I obviously haven't been following closely enough. Not surprising:
there's a lot going on! Could you please tell me exactly which POs
are the relevant ones, and which CFJs are disputing their legality?

Having thought about it a bit, I agree with you. In any case, if it
were only the Chancellor's decision not to mint any new VTs which was
preventing Proposals from being adopted, then it's hard to see which
change to the game state could be cancelled in order to correct this
state of affairs.  Neither the Chancellor's state of mind or eir
decision are part of the game state.

Whether or not there are any VTs in the Bank, Registrar Zefram is still 
required by R1677 to issue a Payment Order from the Bank to you for 5 VTs.
Satisfying the PO then becomes the Chancellor's problem.

Registrar Zefram?

I've done some more thinking, and I think I'd like to liberalize
Annotations even more than I just protoed, by allowing Judges of
*all* CFJs (not just Rule interpretation CFJs) to issue Injunctions
to Annotate a Rule or Rules, and not necessarily (just) with the
Statement of the CFJs they are Judging, but with some kind of summary
of the important interpretative points of the Judgement. I'd probably
want limit the length of such Annotations (say, to 20 lines at 70
characters per line), and give the Rulekeepor the power to remove
Annotations Without Objection. This would probably go a lot further
toward keeping us up to date regarding our own precedents.

Even more radical idea: allow any Player to issue an Injunction
to Annotate the Rules, Without Objection. That way, we could make
a start on incorporating the results of past CFJs into the Rules.

I'll get working on a proto.

Actually, I'd say that probably the main reasons the Plots proto
hasn't yet been proposed are:

1) Both main authors (Blob and Antimatter) deregistered recently,
2) We've been in the midst of about 1 1/2 crises recently, and
3) People want to get PC ironed out before messing with the
Currency rules even further.

Which is exactly my point! This problem is due entirely to PC, 
not to the Indulgence Rules, which were working perfectly well
beforehand.

Yes, for example on CFJ 943 some Rule annotations would have been helpful.

Maybe without objection except for the Player who made the annotations? 
Or maybe that's not necessary. If not, though, maybe allow a regular 
proposal to remove the annotations if passed?

That's fine, just make sure you hold those injunctions to the same 
standards as they would be in a CFJ; i.e. consistent with the Rules, etc.

Great!

In fact, if VTs were destroyed by P3533, then any Player who has
made 3 Proposals since then has Won by Proposals.

Here's a list of the 17 Proposals whose VPs have concluded since
Pragmatic Currencies was adopted:

   3534 Blob            1 Perpetual Offices
   3535 Blob            1 Make Rebellion more interesting
   3536 Steve           1 A Public Voting Experiment
   3537 Steve           1 Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed
   3538 Steve           1 Restore Game Balance II
   3539 Andre           1 Let (most) Attitudes be known
   3540 Andre           1 Secret and Open Friendliness
   3541 Crito           1 Paris Fashions
   3542 Swann           1 Frankenstein Activism
   3543 Harlequin       1 Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies
   3544 Morendil        1 (untitled)
   3545 Morendil        1 (untitled)
   3546 Morendil        1 (untitled)
   3547 Murphy          1 Clarify R880
   3548 Steve           2 A WIN BY INSANITY
   3549 G. Chaos        1 (untitled)
   3550 Andre           1.5 Viral Antidote

By this reckoning then, I Won By Proposal when the VP for P3538 concluded
on Mon, 21 Jul 1997 20:29:47 +0200 (MET DST), Morendil Won by Proposal
when the VP for P3546 concluded at Thu, 28 Aug 1997 10:24:40 -0400, I
Won again when the VP for P3548 concluded at Sat, 06 Sep 1997 02:10:05 UTC
(ironic, since P3548 was an attempted Win by Insanity), and Andre Won
when the VP for P3550 concluded at Thu, 18 Sep 1997 15:21:23 UTC.

It all hangs on the outcome of the Appeal of CFJ 933, if there is one.

Not quite.  The Chancellor created some of both since this crisis was
initiated.  And this assumes your Fix Currencies proposal failed due to lack of
VTs, I presume.

What do you mean? The loophole *was* plugged. See R1697.

I'm sorry that you are annoyed, but I think you misunderstand my position.  I
don't insist that a single, unchallenged act has the force of game custom but
that it can form the basis of game custom.  In my last post regarding Elde's
judgment, I did not say that you were *bound* by my previously unchallenged
action, but that you were free to use it as game custom in your judgement. 
This, of course, would begin to give it greater force as game custom, i.e.
beginning to establish a pattern.

I think you may have been focusing on my own, um, annoyance at the fact that I
solicited challenges to my actions at the time I made them but got no real
response at the time.  To be fair, some (I think you among them) expressed
reluctance to use a judges reasoning in a dismissed CFJ, but no one made a COE
or CFJ to force a reversal of my actions - and I still feel a judges reasoning,
in any official capacity, can form a basis for game custom (basis as described
above).

Well, the temptation of VTs notwithstanding, how exactly are these

R594 already allows Proposals to have whatever effects they specify
to the maximum allowable extent, and I can see no reason why this
wouldn't include adding or removing Annotations.

You're right to raise the issue of the Annotator Objecting. The
Rules actually say that Injunctions to Annotate shall guide the
application of the Rules, so we would want to be wary of scams
involving Annotations. It's a general problem, though: all that
a scam-happy Annotator has to do is find one other person to be
involved in the scam, and that person can prevent the Rulekeepor
from removing the Annotation by Objecting. Is this problem enough
to sink the proposal, or is there is some way out? Perhaps allowing
CFJ to challenge to validity of Annotations on the basis of their
content (ie CFJs of the form: "such and such an Annotation should
not be held to guide play".) If we're going to allow Judges much more
latitude on what they can include in Injunctions to Annotate, then
we're probably going to need such a mechanism anyway.

Elde's estate in a timely fashion.

I like the first idea, but not the second.  Past CFJs may no longer be
relevant, and any attempt to install old precedents formally should
be, IMO, Judged again.

You're quite right that lots of past CFJs are no longer relevant.
But remember that the Without Objection requirement is a pretty
strong one: if even one Player objects to your proposed Annotation
of a Rule based on a past CFJ, then the Rules won't get Annotated.

On the other hand, I can think of other objections to the second
suggestion: it amounts to a bypass of the Judicial system altogether
which may not be appropriate. It's probably best to leave Annotating
the Rules to Judges.

Given that a single Objector can prevent the scam Annotation from
being added in the first place, how serious does this problem become?
