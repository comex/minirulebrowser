Why must are people being so bitchy?  Not just Steve or Scott, could 
be to blame here, but the rest of us for sitting back and letting 
people annoy oneanother.  It was not so long ago that Andre left as 
well.  But before I start being a big hypocrite, WOULD EVERYBODY STOP 
ANNOYING ONEANOTHER, because it really pisses me off.

Protoposal  "Competitive Priority Changes"

Amend rule 1771 "Changing Priority" by appending it with the following 
paragraph.

A player may only increase the priority of a proposal once every week.  
If a player has already increased the priority of a proposal e shall 
not increase the priority of that proposal again for the duration of 
that week.

Is there much point to this? Don't we essentially raise it all at once
anyway?

If you have several people who both want to get proposals distributed 
the same week and say there are 4 proposals just above the bar height,  
when the batchsize is only 2.  One of the players would boost their 
proposal up a bit by raising its priority, and so another players 
proposal is knock out, and so they raise their priority....and so 
on...  If this proposal was adopted, several things would happen to 
replace the above scenario.  Players would spend more to deter other 
players from out bidding them, and also players would wait until the 
last moment to raise the priority of their proposals.  However, as the 
proto stands players could still lower the priority of other 
proposals, I wasn't sure if this was a good or a bad thing...  I think 
I'll change it next time round though.

I would Vote AGAINST this Proposal in its current form.

I don't want any rules lawyer to be able to interpret this as the *sole*
effect of adoption such a Proposal.  I would prefer "When a Proposal
containing Orders is adopted, those Orders are executed".
