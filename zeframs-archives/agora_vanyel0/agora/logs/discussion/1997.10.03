Did the re-assignment of CFJ 930 arrive in everyone's mailbox in an 
attached file, or just mine? If it's everyone's, I can't say I like that 
method of delivering official messages. Or maybe this is a quirk of my 
system?

Mine too. A 284K file seems a bit excessive. On a lighter note, it seems
we are well on the way to a record for the number of Justices on an
appeal. Let's keep this thing going!

"The initial owner of each Object is the Bank, unless otherwise specified."
or
"Whenever the owner of an individual Object is otherwise unspecified, its
Owner is the Bank."

But then the Rules (specifically this Rule) *do* specify a Recordkeepor
for the Class.  Throw in an "otherwise".

I hope you're going to place some restrictions on how Classes of Objects
may be created...

"If N Objects of one Class are Convertible into M Objects of a second
Class (where M and N are two non-zero integers), then any entity that
owns N Objects of the first Class may Convert them into M Objects of
the second Class."

How about making Convertibility transitive?  "If N Objects of Class X
are Convertible into M Objects of Class Y, and M Objects of Class Y are
Convertible into P Objects of Class Z, then N Objects of Class X are
Convertible into P Objects of Class Z."

"When the Rules specify that N Objects of Class X are Equivalent to M
Objects of Class Y, then N Objects of Class X are Convertible into M Objects
of Class Y, and vice versa."

This is redundant.

I feel there's a better way to word this, but I can't think of anything

That last bit seems a bit silly.  How about "The Speaker shall announce

It would invalidate any moves pertaining to the Objects in question.

Why Decimal?

Well, you *could* have asked *me*, you know.  My latest copy of the
Regs is posted below, just for the hell of it.

>I hereby dissolve the Democratic Movement.

So noted.


----- Last known Regulations of the Democratic Movement -----

 0. The name of the Organization is 'Democratic Movement'. It is of the Class
    Contest.

 1. The purpose of the Democratic Movement is to improve the democratic Content
    of Agora Nomic in general, and the adherence to the 'One man, one 
    vote'-principle in particular.

 2. The Democratic Movement tries to erect a Group to get closer to these
    goals. However, Contestants of the Democratic Movement are not forced
    by these Regulations to become Foundors or Members of this Group.

 3. The Contest Fee is 0 P-Notes.

 4. The Administrator can at any time resign, provided e appoints a willing
    Contestant as eir Replacement.

 5. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on changing the
    Regulations. This is done by sending a message to all other Contestants,
    which must clearly indicate an Internal Vote is started on changing the
    Regulations, as well as the change that is to be voted upon.

 6. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on replacing the
    Administrator. This is done by sending a message to all other Contestants,
    which must clearly indicate an Internal Vote is started on replacing the
    Administrator, as well as the person, who needs to be a Contestant, who
    is voted upon to replace em. If that person votes AGAINST, the vote
    automatically fails.

 7. Any Contestant can at any time call an Internal Vote on using or
    transferring any Currencies in the Contest's treasury in some way. This 
    is done by sending a message to all other Contestants, which must clearly 
    indicate an Internal Vote is started on using or transferring Currencies, 
    which Currencies and the amount of them are to be used or transferred, 
    and the way they are to be used or the Treasury they are to be transferred
    to. If such a vote succeeds, the Administrator shall be responsible for
    using or transferring the Currencies in the way specified with the vote, 
    unless there is not enough of the Currency in the Contest's Treasury, or
    the Rules do not allow such a transfer or usage.

 8. An internal vote has a voting period of 7 days, or until all Contestants
    have voted, whichever is shorter. All votes must be cast by sending a 
    message to all other Contestants indicating the Proposal voted upon and 
    the vote casted. Only Contestants can vote. Votes can be any of 'FOR', 
    'ABSTAIN' and 'AGAINST'. The vote succeeds if and only if it meets quorum 
    and there are more 'FOR' than 'AGAINST'-votes. This Regulation defers to 
    all other Regulations.

 9. A vote meets quorum if and only if at least 2 Contestants vote, or both
    1 Contestant votes and the total number of Contestants does not exceed 2.

10. Any Contestant may at any time leave the Contest. Any change in or repeal
    of this Regulation is delayed until 1 week after posting of a message to 
    the Agora Public Forum notifying that the Regulation has been changed or
    repealed.

Rather than using the term "Objects", perhaps you should call them
"Commodities" as it seems less ambiguous and more accurately captures the
meaning.

If we were playing ftf Nomic using poker chips as VTs, and the Rules
stated that VTs were destroyed, how would you interpret this? As calling
for the destruction of the actual poker chips? Or merely as calling
for the cessation of legal recognition of the chips as VTs? Myself,
I'd opt for the latter. Plastic makes a nasty smell when you burn it.

Hm. Is this correct? General Chaos is no longer the Speaker. On the
other hand, three Players appealed before the end of the Quarter.
Still, I tend to think that I should be serving on this Appeal.

Were you aware of your possible selection as Justice in the
important CFJ 933? The selection was disputed, but in any case
you've now defaulted.

I thought we'd setlled this already. R1586 is irrelevant; the Bank
and the Mint are not the same Entity and not continuous with each
other.

The Honourable thing to do would be to decline...maybe.

In my view, none at all. We have here a different case, since all
concede that P3533 destroyed the Bank and created the Mint, and these
two Entities are not the same and not continuous. There's no point
trying to claim that there is continuous Entity called "the Mintor of
VTs", since 'the' in that description is just ambiguous.

However, the Rules do not say I have to report the penalties at the same
time or before reassignment. I have made a special posting with all
Infractions, Penalties and Salaries.

                        JUDGEMENT CFJ 828
          The Rules generally should be interpreted such that
          the Mintor of the Group Coins of any given Group is
          the Mint, and that all Group Coins existing just prior
          to the adoption of Proposal 1760 still existed just
          after the adoption of Proposal 1760.

======================================================================

Arguments:

  The new Organization Rules are a bit wavy on Group Coins.
  766 clearly causes such things to exist, but it does not
  explicitly say what the Mintor is.  Neither it nor any
  other Rule seems to "specifically permit" a Group "to
  become the Mintor of a Currency", so by 1474 the Mintor
  of a Group's Coins cannot be the Group itself.  By 1467,
  if the Mintor of a Currency is otherwise undefined, it's
  the Mint, so the Mint is apparently the Mintor of Group
  Coins.

  Now on continuity: the Judgements in CFJs 815 and 816
  teach that when the Rules governing a type of entity change,
  and some plausible changes to the existing entities of
  that type will bring them into conformance with the Rules,
  those changes occur.  It seems correct, then, to say that
  the existing Group Coins, and the various Currencies of
  which they are instances, continue to exist, and just
  change as needed (their Mintors used to be the Groups,
  for instance, and now it's the Mint).

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgment: FALSE

Reasons and Arguments:

This judgement turns on a precise reading of Rule 1471.  I was strongly
inclined to say that the old Coins continue to exist but am now unable
to do so.

Rule 766 explicitly defines Coins to be a Currency.  As there is no
entity otherwise defined in the Rules to be their Mintor, (the title
of Rule 1474 is not part of the Rule) the second paragraph of Rule 1467
tells us that their Mintor is the Mint.

Rule 1474/0 clearly said that the Mintor for a Group's Coins was the
Group. That language was amended away by Proposal 1760, and the Group
issuing the Coins then ceased to have authority to be a Mintor, that
authority now going to the Mint.

Rule 1471/0 states that

   If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.


Therefore the old Coins ceased to exist upon adoption of Proposal 1760.

------

It may be objected that the intention of 1471 was not to destroy the
Coins in any transfer of Mintors.  I respond that it was not anyone's
"intention" to change the Group Coin Mintor at all, but it still
happened.

It may be objected that 1471 ought to be interpreted that when the
Mintor's authority is transferred from one Mintor to another, that the
Mintor has not "ceased to have authority to be a Mintor" since the new
Mintor still has that authority.

I reject this interpretation as counter-linguistic; it would interpret
the following statements as tautologically false:  "a Voter ceases to be
a Player", or "an Officer ceases to fill that Office", or "the Speaker-
elect ceases to be Speaker-elect" or "a Contestant ceases to be a
Contestant".  Statements like these may be found in Rules 1043, 880,
402, and 1539.

Even though a conclusion is inconvenient, the temptation of avoiding it
by misinterpreting the Rules, or language, must be resisted.  The change
of Mintor means that one entity ceased to have the authority and another
one began having it.

It may be objected that CFJ 815 should be interpreted as keeping the
Coins in existence.  Judge |favor|'s excellent judgement should be read
carefully; it states in favored conclusion (b.),

                    For some Entities and some Rule changes,
      of course, the only change to the Entity that would
      bring it (or the Game state as a whole) into conformance
      with the Rules would be for it to cease to exist.

In any case, CFJ 815 is an interpretation of Rule 1011.  Rule 1011 only
has something to say if the Rules do not specify an action.  In this
case Rule 1471 clearly specifies the action of destroying all Coins and
the old Currency.

------

Recommendation:

I recommend that legislation be passed curing the defects in Rules 1471
and 766.

FIRST: That Rule 1471 be amended to delete the above language and instead
say

      If at any time, a Currency ceases to have a valid Mintor, then
      all units of that Currency are immediately destroyed, and Currency
      ceases to exist.

This is like the wording for the requirement of having a Recordkeepor.


SECOND: That Rule 766 be amended to add language saying

      The Mintor for each variety of Group Coin is the associated Group.

Rule 766/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Groups

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Group.

      A Group's Compact consists only of Statutes, and are known
      collectively as its Ordinances, an individual Statute of its
      Compact is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as
      the Group's Ordinancekeepor.  A Group has one Treasury, and its
      Executor is known as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group has an associated form of Currency.  The generic name of
      all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific name of a Group's
      Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      Players within the Ordinances' Jurisdiction are known as the
      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of
      the Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must
      be a Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.

Rule 1467/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Definition of a Currency

      A Currency is a type of Nomic Entity.  Only those Nomic Entities
      which are specifically defined by the Rules as being Currencies
      are Currencies.

      A Currency must have a Name (which must not be the name of any
      other Currency), a minimum unit quantity, a Recordkeepor, and a
      Mintor.  The Mintor of a Currency is the Mint if it is not
      otherwise defined.

      The minimum unit quantity (MUQ) of a Currency is the smallest
      amount of that Currency which may be transferred.  All
      transfers, holdings, and calculations involving a given Currency
      shall be rounded off to the nearest multiple of its MUQ.  The
      MUQ of a given Currency is 1, unless another Rule specifies a
      different MUQ for that Currency.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency is the Player who is required to
      maintain a record of the amount of that Currency held in the
      various Treasuries which exist.  If a Currency ceases to have a
      valid Recordkeepor, the Banker (or, in eir absence, the Speaker)
      shall fulfill that responsibility until a new Recordkeepor is
      selected according to the appropriate procedures.  If no
      procedure exists to select a new recordkeepor, all units of the
      Currency are instead destroyed, and the Currency ceases to
      exist.

      The Mintor of a Currency is the Nomic Entity which is authorized
      to create and destroy units of that Currency.  If the Mintor of
      a Currency ceases to exist, all units of the Currency are
      immediately destroyed, and the Currency also ceases to exist.

      The Banker shall maintain a record of all existing Currencies
      and their MUQs, Recordkeepors, and Mintors.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1471/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, create new units of
      that Currency, so long as this creation is permitted by the
      Rules.  These newly-created units of Currency are placed in the
      Treasury of the Mintor.  Units of Currency may not otherwise be
      created except as specifically authorized by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are immediately destroyed, and Currency ceases to exist.

      The Mintor of the Currency shall notify the Recordkeepor of the
      Currency as soon as possible after it creates or destroys Units
      of Currency.

      A Mintor must have a Treasury.

Rule 1474/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Coins

      Each Group shall have an associated Currency, the name of which
      shall be formed by appending the word "Coins" to the name of the
      Group.  The MUQ of all Group Coins is 1.  The Recordkeepor for
      each variety of Group Coin is the Vizier of the associated
      Group.  The Mintor for each variety of Group Coin is the
      associated Group.

Rule 1474/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Coins

      An Organization is permitted to be the Mintor of a Currency
      _only_ if that Organization possesses a Treasury, _and_ if the
      Rules defining that Organization's Class specifically permit it
      to become the Mintor of a Currency.

      Each Rule that permits an Organization of a specific Class to be
      a Mintor must define a unique generic name for every type of
      Currency associated with that Class of Organization.

      The name of any Currency associated with a specific Organization
      shall be the Name of the Organization followed by the unique
      generic name defined by the Class of that Organization.

      The Recordkeepor of any Organization's Currency is the Executor
      of the associated Organization.  The MUQ of all such Currencies
      is 1.

======================================================================

This was the Judgement as issued too late by Coco:

Judgement: FALSE
Reasoning:
Since the previous rules governing Groups specified that each Group was
the mintor of it's own Coins, the caller's arguement for continuity
would be contradicted by tranferring the authority to mint Coins from
Groups to the Mint.

No they didn't.  Chuck's appeal was three and a half hours after the
Quarter change.

I generally like this Object idea.  But there are a couple of problems.
Your "Legal State" and "Actual State" don't seem to achieve anything,
except for the doubling of paperwork.  The Rule defining them:

...
>     There is also the "Legal State" of those Objects, which is the 
>     record of ownership and number that reflects what the Recordkeepor
>     would have recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect
>     knowledge, and absence of error.
...
>     Whenever a CFJ (or an admitted COE) finds that at some point the 
>     Actual State of an Object (or set of Objects) was not also the 
>     Legal State of that Object (or set of Objects) the Recordkeepor for 
>     that Object (or set of Objects) must adjust eir records so that the 
>     Actual State of those Objects conforms to the Legal State of those 
>     Objects as specified in the CFJ (or admitted COE).
>
>     Object Records can be Ratified. The effect of such Ratification is 
>     to change the Legal State of the recorded Objects to conform to the 
>     Actual State of those Objects.

achieves nothing -- if there is only one state of Objects, the
Recordkeepor would still be required to record changes in the same way,
and COEs and Ratifications would have the same effect.  Drop the Actual
State business, and just state that Transfers only occur when they
are reported.

You also have Blots acting as a negative version of all Objects.  I think
it would probably be better to state that all Classes of Transferrable
Object have a non-Transferrable counterpart, and the two are mutually
Negatively Convertible.  Maybe also make persistent ownership of
anti-Objects an Infraction, like the current system.

I think the Decimal Objects won't work as well as you expect.  Equivalence
doesn't seem to work perfectly.  It would be better to make deci-VTs
the real Objects, and establish VT as a legal synonym for 10 deci-VTs,
without having two Classes of Object.

This seems to be a retreat to the old "transfers happen" paradigm that
was eliminated previously.  I won't tolerate that.

Actually, the third appeal was made on Oct 1; Chuck's timezone puts
his appeal in the wee hours of Oct 1, UTC.

No it doesn't (at least it shouldn't) the only actual transfers that should

Mine came in the normal portion of the message.  But then I have Groupwise,

Note that if all Players are presently subscribed to agora-discussion,
Calabresi's post satisfied the requirements for a PF discussion.
Would the Distributor care to comment on whether all Players are

Yes, but it appears to put Recordkeepors under an obligation to
discover transfers that arise spontaneously, and then make the
transfers.  In short, it transfers the burden of discovery back onto
Recordkeepors.  One of the main points of Pragmatic Currencies was to
remove this burden from Recordkeepors, who have enough other things to

Doesn't it only count if the message specifically says it is intended
for the PF?  I originally thought this one did, but as elJefe points out,
there is an alternative interpretation.  In any case, I doubt that Elde

I'll agree with 1563 and 1565(vi), but on reflection, I'm not
so sure about 1565(iii).  After all, isn't 998 relevant to the
Rules inasmuch as its judgement could have bearing on the
proper judgement of CFJ 998?

Argument:

There has been made an argument that since the Rules Governing Groups
have been amended substantially, that any Groups formed under the old
Rules cease to exist-- or at least cease to have any effect vis-a-vis
the Game of Agora.  It is my contention that there is nothing to support
this view, and in fact, the oft-referenced 1011 actually forbids such an
interpretation.

Before the adoption of 1760, there was a class of Entities known as Groups
the contention is that, since 1760 made wholesale changes to the Entitie
known as Groups, that the incompatibly-formed prior Groups ceased to exist.

This is in direct contradiction with 1011!

>From 1011:

     Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

What Rule specifies the destruction of the old Groups?  None.  Certainly
the amendments in 1760 say nothing about repealing the legal authority of
prior Groups.  Any such diminishment of prior Groups is an arbitrary change,
wholly outside the authority of the Ruleset, and therefore void.

And, since Groups themselves are still a defined Entity in the Ruleset, and
there was no period of time where Groups were not defined, any alleged
discontinuity is addressed by 1011.  The Rules changed the way Groups
were defined, therefore the Entities known as Groups changed their properties,
because that is the only option specified by the Rules.

======================================================================

Arguments Judge:

I approach this CFJ with some trepidation, as it touches on
deep and largely unvisited areas of Agora metaphysics and
ontology.  The fact that it is a CFJ on the interpretation
of a specific Rule, though, limits its scope enough that I
have some hope of dealing adequately with the questions raised,
in this limited context.

The issues underlying the truth or falsehood of the Statement
concern the nature of the relationship between the Rules
of Agora and the rest of the Game state; in particular,
between the Rules that define and govern Game Entities and
instances of the Entities themselves, especially as the
Rules change over time.  The fact that the Rules do in
fact change over time complicates the relationship
enormously.

So what does in fact happen to an existing Game Entity when
the Rules that govern its properties (its nature, its
description, its relationship to the rest of the Game)
change?  The Statement requires us, in particular, to
consider whether or not the Entity changes to conform to
the amendment; that is, whether or not the Entity changes
in such a way that the new version of the Rules correctly
describes it.  There seem to be three possiblities here,
for any particular Entity and any particular Rule change:

 a) The Entity might remain unchanged, despite the change
    to the Rules.  This seems unlikely, though, as the
    Entity would then be in violation of the Rules; for
    a Platonist, this is flatly impossible, whereas for
    a Pragmatist it is at least a mistake.  While there is
    no Rule that explictly says that all Entities must
    conform to the Rules, such a Rule seems unnecessary:
    it is essential to the Rules being Rules that the
    Entities they create must at all times conform to them.
    So this possibility is not to be taken seriously.

 b) The Entity might change, so as to be in conformance
    with the new state of the Rules.  This seems relatively
    unproblematic.  For some Entities and some Rule changes,
    of course, the only change to the Entity that would
    bring it (or the Game state as a whole) into conformance
    with the Rules would be for it to cease to exist.  If,
    for instance, the Rules governing a particular Entity
    were to be amended so as to be completely different,
    and describe some other Entities with no properties in
    common with the Entities they previously defined (or
    to define no Entities at all), it would be foolish to
    place great weight on the simple fact of an unchanging
    Rule number.  Similarly, if all the Rules that provide
    for an Entity to exist at all are repealed without
    simultaneous replacement, the only permissible change
    would seem to be destruction. But in general, there will be
    some lesser change to the existing Entities that will bring
    them into conformance with the Rules while still
    allowing them to exist.

    Ideal Rule Changes will of course specify exactly
    what changes should occur to existing Entities to bring
    them into conformance with the new Rules for that
    type of Entity.  But where the Rules are silent on
    the issue, for whatever reason, the issue must be
    settled in some other way; by, for instance, the
    Courts (per Rule 217 and family), or simply the
    rational consensus of the Players.

 c) The Entity might simply cease to exist, or cease to
    be an Entity of the type that it formerly was, by
    virtue of the change to its governing Rules, despite
    the fact that a less-drastic change could have brought
    it into conformance with the new Rules.  There seems
    to be little reason to adopt this strategy, however,
    and a Judge called upon to decide on the fate of some
    pre-existing Entities in a case where the new Rules
    are silent on the issue of conformance-chanes would be
    well-advised to consider it only as a last resort, as
    suggested in the previous paragraph.

What light is thrown on the above musings by Game Custom and previous
Judgements?  Surprisingly little.  The Potato CFJ, for instance,
which at first seems relevant at least to the issue that led to
this CFJ, is in fact not relevant to the present Statement, since
that case did not involve a change to Rules that governed the
properties of a pre-existing Game Entity.  It was, in particular,
the finding of the Judge that there was no pre-existing Game
Entity of the type governed by the new Rule.  That case also
involved a newly-created Rule, not an amendment as the current
Statement specifies.  The Judgement held that a previously-
existing Entity which had been given a particular name by a
Player acting within the Rules did not simply by virtue of
this name take on the properties of a similarly-named Entity
later created by a new Rule; this raises issues in the same
general area as the current question, but not close enough to
shed any light on the current Statement itself.

Game Custom clearly teaches that at least *some* of the properties
of an Entity are implicitly changed when the Rules governing those
properties are changed.  There are countless examples; Rules on
Kudos, Points, Marks, Contests, and so on have all been changed,
without any suggestion that the pre-existing Entities of that
class should therefore cease to exist.  At first glance, this
might seem to give us our answer without further effort, but
while I think it is extremely suggestive and helpful, it is not
entirely final.  I have been unable to find a very strong example
of a deep and fundamental change to the nature of a pre-existing
Entity being caused by a change to the governing Rule in the
absence of a "grandfather" clause.  Such a finding would have
been conclusive that (b) above is the correct consequence of
even such deep changes.  On the other hand, I found no cases
on the other side, either, of Entities ceasing to exist when
they could have been changed instead.  So on balance (b)
still seems the heavy favorite.

Having determined, so far, that (b) seems correct, and that
the Rules and Game Custom (not to speak of common sense)
favor the truth of the dependant clause in the Statement,
what shall we make of the Statement as a whole?  Does the
truth of the dependant clause in fact rest on interpretation
of Rule 1011?

The Argument presented by the Caller deals mainly with the
application of the Statement to a particular issue that
is currently before the Agoran Public.  Since the statement
itself does not mention that issue, however, no Judgement
on the issue itself is required.  The Argument does,
however, illustrate how Rule 1011 comes into consideration.
It would be possible to interpret 1011 so as to prohibit
(b) above (that interpretation would also, as far as I
can tell, prohibit (c), and we'd be in a fine mess).  If
the correct interpretation of 1011 does prohibit (b),
then, the Statement should be judged FALSE.  Otherwise,
it is TRUE.

Under what circumstances would 1011 prohibit the changes
to Game Entities suggested in (b)?  1011 prohibits any
changes to certain types of Entity, if those changes are
caused "by any action other than those specified by the
Rules".  Could the changes suggested in (b) be a change
of the type thus prohibited?  The changes in (b) are
caused by a change to the Rules.  That isn't an action,
though, so since causation is transitive we continue to
follow the chain.  Changes to the Rules are caused by
various actions, and (by Rule 116) the only actions
which can cause changes to the Rules are actions that are
permitted by (which will do as a synonym for "specified
by" in this context) the Rules.  So: the actions which
cause the changes suggested in (b) are actions specified
by the Rules; therefore, Rule 1011 does not prohibit those
changes.  This, along with the considerations of Game
Custom and so on outlined above, lead us to conclude that
the Statement in this CFJ is TRUE.

  Judged FALSE by Chuck, 27 Oct 1995, 22:04 CDT

======================================================================

Arguments:

Prior to the adoption of Proposal 1760, Groups, Contests, and Contracts 
existed by the virtue of their own empowering Rules (766, 1446, and 1455, 
respectively).  None of the existing entities was, in any way, an 
Organization (since such things only came into being with Proposal 1760).

Proposal 1760 amended Rules 766, 1446, and 1455 creating classes of 
Organizations known as Groups, Contests, and Contracts.  However, no 
part of Proposal 1760 in any way makes those entities which existed 
prior to its adoption become Organizations.  The only method by which 
an Organization can come into existence is that method specified in the 
new Rule 1533/0.  None of the Groups, Contests, or Contracts in existence 
prior to the adoption of Proposal 1760 comply with these requirements, 
and therefore are not Organizations.  Since the authorizing legislation
for the existence of these Entities no longer permits them to exist,
they all cease to exist at the time of the adoption of Proposal 1760.

Rule 1011 forbids the old Groups, etc., from becoming Organizations 
except as specified by the Rules; they can't just do this magically.
So either they cease to exist, or at the very least they cease to be 
be Groups/Contests/Contracts, because they lack status as Organizations, 
and thus lose their Treasuries, and any right to cast a Vote.

It is long-established Game Custom that when an Entity created by the 
Rules ceases to have authority to exist under the Rules, then it ceases
to exist.  (Recall the Office of the Sweepstakes Officer.)

Prior Judgements also support this view.  CFJ 803 held that Rule 1488 
(created by Proposal 1647) created a new entity ("The Nomic Potato") 
regardless of the fact that Zefram had created a Contest called "The 
Nomic Potato" during the Voting Period for the Proposal.

======================================================================

Reasons and Arguments Judge:

I question the value of presenting reasons and arguments, as
this Judgement is almost certain to be appealed, but I will
present them nonetheless.

Prior to the passage of Proposal 1760, Rules 766, 1446, and 1455
defined Groups, Contests, and Contracts, respectively.  After
the passage of Proposal 1760, Rules 766, 1446, and 1455
defined Groups, Contests, and Contracts, respectively.
The central question here is whether the Groups, Contests,
and Contracts after 1760 were continuous with those
before; or if there is no continuity, in which case
the Groups, Contests, and Contracts which existed
before 1760 ceased to exist with the adoption of 1760.

Let us first examine the general question: when an
Entity is redefined by an amendment, does the Entity
exist continuously, or is the Entity destroyed, and
a new Entity with the same name Created?  The Rules
provide no answer.  Game Custom?  Entities tend to be
considered continuous in most cases, but this is not always
the case.  In short, there is no general answer to this
question--it is a matter of magnitude of the redefinition
of the Entity.  Most redefinitions are insignificant enough
that there can be a continuity, but some are so major that
there can be no continuity.  It is correct, as some have
pointed out, that the fact that the name remains the same
does not automatically mean that the Entity is continuous.
However, it seems to me that there is a strong game
custom that if an Entity, being redefined, retains the
same name, then the Entity *is* continuous if a continuity
is at all possible.  After all, normally when an Entity
is redefined, we do not ask if it ceased to exist then
came into existence again; we naturally assume that it
did not.  So why is it questioned here?  Because it
seems as if the change to Groups, Contests, and Contracts
may have been so drastic so as to allow no continuity.  So
the question then becomes, can there be a continuity?

Let us first address the argument, which has been advanced,
that under the new Rules there can be only one each Group, Contest,
and Contract.  If correct, then I would agree that the nature
of Group(s), Contest(s), and Contract(s) has changed so radically
as to allow no continuity.

This argument rests on the first sentences of Rules 766, 1446,
and 1455.  The first sentence of Rule 766 reads, "Let there be a
Class of Organization known as a Group."  (The first sentences
of 1446 and 1455 are similar.)  Taken on its own, I *might*
agree that it implies there is only a single Group.  However,
the rest of the Rule *clearly* implies that there can be more
than one Group.  Thus, in that light, the natural interpretation
of that sentence is "Let there be a Class of Organization, the
members of which are known as Groups."  True, it could have been
worded more clearly, but even given this ambiguous wording, I
believe this is the proper interpretation.

The other argument advanced is that regarding the identity of
the "new" Groups as Organizations.  (In fact, it can be the only
argument advanced, as in all other respects "old" Groups are essentially
the same as "new" Groups.)  "Old" Groups were not Organizations.
"New" Groups are.  Thus, either the "old" Groups ceased to exist,
or the "old" Groups suddenly became Organizations.  Could
the "old" Groups suddenly become Organizations?

First, let us note that *if* "old" Groups suddenly became
Organizations, then Groups are continuous, as there is no
other obstacle to their continuity.  As I noted above,
given that the Entities share the same name, we must assume
they are continuous unless we can demonstrate otherwise.
Thus, to suggest that suddenly becoming Organizations prevents
any possible continuity is a circular argument at best, and
if we are to accept this argument, we must have some outside
reason why Groups cannot suddenly become Organizations.

Thus, we are presented with Rule 1011, which some allege prevents
this from taking place.  Does it?

Rule 1011/0 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.
      (*Was: 450*)

"...may *not* be changed by any action other than those specified
by the Rules."

Is the action of Groups suddenly becoming Organizations specified
by the Rules?  Yes!  It is specified by the new Rule 766, which
states that Groups are Organizations.  It does not *explicitly*
state that Groups become Organizations, but this must be the
case for Groups to exist; as I noted above, given that the
names are the same, we must assume a continuity if at *all*
possible within the Rules; that leads us to this conclusion, i.e.
that existing Groups do suddenly become Organizations upon the
adoption of 1760.

It has been suggested that the word "specified" necessarily means
"explicitly specified."  This argument is absurd; it can just
as well mean "implicitly specified."  There are numerous changes
which occur every day which are not explicitly specified; and
thus there is a strong Game Custom that 1011 does not mean
that changes must be *eplicitly* specified.  I will give just
one example: let's look at Rule 790, specifying the method of
filling vacant Offices:

Rule 790/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      If, for any reason, an Office is vacant, that fact shall be
      announced by the Electioneer.  The Electioneer shall be the
      Registrar; or in eir absence, the Speaker.  All Players willing
      to hold the Office shall notify the Electioneer of that fact
      within three days of eir announcement of the vacancy.  At the
      end of the three day period, the Electioneer shall randomly
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.  This
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      rule applies to Offices in general, and thus defers to Rules for
      specific Offices.
      (*Was: 689*)


Note it says, "that Player shall become that Officer."  It does
not explicitly say the Office is filled.  Naturally, it does *imply*
the Office is filled--and very clearly so--but it does not state
so explicitly.  Here is an example of an implicit change--the
change in the Office from a vacant state to a filled state--but
no one would suggest that the change does not take place because
it is not explicitly stated, even given Rule 1011.  Innumerable
implicit changes take place like this every day.  They
are usually so obviously *implicit* in the Rules that we do
not even consider to question them.  To interpret 1011 in the
manner suggested by some would be absurd, chaotic, and most
importantly, against Game Custom.

In conclusion, there can be a continuity between "old" Groups
and "new" Groups; since there can be a continuity, and the
Entities have the same name, we must conclude that there *is*
a continuity; thus, Groups suddenly became Organizations upon
the adoption of 1760, as implied by Rule 766.  (Similar
arguments apply to Contests and Contracts.)

PROPOSAL 1760 (Swann) AI=1, protoed
Group, Contract and Contest Consolidation

Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Organizations"
(it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      Let there be a set of Nomic Entities known as Organizations.  Every 
      individual Organization has associated with it a body of text known as
      its Compact, a Player known as the Organization's Administrator, a set
      of Players who are within the Jurisdiction of the Organization's
      Compact, and a unique specific Name.

      In addition, any Organization which possesses Treasuries has a Player
      who is Executor of the Organization.  An Organization only possess
      Treasuries if the Rules governing that Orginization specify so.

{Comment: Orginizations are collective Entities, consisting of a Compact.
          (Regulations/Ordinances/Bylaws/Terms &c.)  Generically they have
          an Administrator (Ordinancekeepor/Contestmaster/High Wazoo &c.)
          a set of Associated Players (Members/Contestants/Parties) and a
          Name.  If it possesses one or more Treasuries, it also has an
          Executor (Vizier/Contestmaster/Moneylender &c.) but this Rule
          itself doesn't grant Treasuries to Orginizations.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Compacts: Statutes, and
Warranties" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      The Compact of an Organization consists of either or both of the
      following elements:

         i) Statutes; defined as that collective text which is legally
            binding under the Rules, and must be obeyed by Players within
            the Compact's Jurisdiction as if it was a part of the Ruleset.

        ii) Warranties; defined as that collective text which requires
            Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction to either obey it or
            suffer penalties defined within the Rules or the Compact.

      A Compact may only possess those elements allowed it by the Rules
      defining its Class of Organization.  If these Rules do not specify,
      the Compact may only consist of Statutes.

{Comment: This is obviously drafted to segragate out the legal differences
          between the enforcement mechaanisim between Contracts and
          Compacts.  As Vanyel's pointes out, Warranties are strictly
          pragmatic, you act in violation of them, the only effect to the
          Game State is the punisment mandated by the Rules or the Compact.
          Such Warranty violations aren't illegal, or retractable.  Statutes
          are like the Ruleset, and violations (if they're possible, which
          Kelly will debate) are certianly Rule violations as well-- and
          thus are Platonic.  I think this is at least as clear, if not
          clearer, than the current distinctions (which are carried out
          under multiple Rules, possibbly diluting their interpretation.)}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Compacts: Jurisdiction"
(it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's Compact is a subset of the set
      of all Players. A Compact has no force to require, or oblige, anything
      of Players who are not within its Jurisdiction.  (This does not absolve
      any Players of duties required of them by the Rules.)

      Within its Jurisdiction, a Compact's ability to dictate Players'
      activity is limited to the extent permitted by the Rules.

      A Compact can only have Jurisdiction over Players permitted to it
      by the Rules governing its Class of Organization.

      No Compact may have effect prior to its Creation, nor may it have
      effect subsequent to its dissolution.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule governing 
      Compacts.

{Comment: Essentially this sets the basic limits of Orginzational power
          thus the precidence clause.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Administrators and Their
Duties" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      The Administrator of an Organization must keep an accurate copy
      of its Compact and an accurate list of the Players within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction.

      E must record any and all changes to the Compact, and must, As
      Soon As Possible after such changes, distribute an up-to-date copy
      of the Compact to every Player within the Compact's Jurisdiction.

      E must also notify the Notary whenever the Executor (if any) of eir
      Organization Changes.  When the Administrator of an Organization
      changes, the new Administrator must inform the Notary of this
      change.  These notifications must be made As Soon As Possible.

      The Administrator of an Organization must come from within the
      Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact unless otherwise specified
      by the Rules governing its Class.

{Comment: The Administrator is the strict Recordkeepor of eir
          Orginization.  This language alters the duties of a Group's
          Vizier somewhat as far as reporting changes in leadership
          go.  This was doine in the interest of consistency.  It
          makes more sense for the Admistrator to report such Changes.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Organizations' Executors and
Their Duties" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      The Executor of an Organization is the person legally responsible
      for reporting, to the appropriate Recordkeepors, any and all
      transfers out of the Organization's Treasury.  The Executor may
      only transfer funds as permitted by the Rules governing the Class
      of the Organization e is Executor of, and e may be further bound by
      the Compact of eir Organization.   The Executor of an Organization
      must come from within the Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact
      unless otherwise specified by the Rules governing its Class.

{Comment: The Executor is strictly in charge of the Treasury.  Via the
          definiton of Executor elsewhere, e should govern all the
          Player-like actions of Orginizations, where the Administrator
          conducts the broad Recordkeeping duties.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Creation of Organizations, and
Their Compacts" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if such
Category exists.)

      Organizations (and, simultaneously, their initial Compacts) are
      created in the following manner:

      A set of Players, known as the Foundors, sends a message to the 
      Notary containing the following information:

         i) The Class of the created Organization.
        ii) The Unique Name of the particular Organization being created.
       iii) The inital Compact for the proposed Orginization.
        iv) Any information required by Rules governing that specific
            Class of Organization.

      The Organization is created and is in force once the Notary
      receives the above information from all required Foundors.

      The set of required Foundors is specified within the Rules defining
      the particular Class of Organization, but they must be from within
      the Jurisdiction of the new Organization's Compact. Additional
      restrictions on the set of Foundors can be made by those Rules.

      This Rule defers when other Rules specifically claim precedence over
      its requirements. Otherwise, these requirements take precedence.


Let Rule 1474 be amended to read as follows:

      An Organization is permitted to be the Mintor of a Currency _only_ if
      that Organization possesses a Treasury, _and_ if the Rules defining
      that Organization's Class specifically permit it to become the Mintor
      of a Currency.

      Each Rule that permits an Organization of a specific Class to be a
      Mintor must define a unique generic name for every type of Currency
      associated with that Class of Organization.

      The name of any Currency associated with a specific Organization 
      shall be the Name of the Organization followed by the unique 
      generic name defined by the Class of that Organization.

      The Recordkeepor of any Organization's Currency is the Executor of 
      the associated Organization.  The MUQ of all such Currencies is 1.


{Comment: This allows multiple types of Currency, as long as they're defined
          explicitly in the Rules.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Compacts Can Require Some
Currency Transfers" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if
such Category exists.)

      An Organization's Compact may only require Currency transfers that are
      made from the Treasuries it possesses (if any such exist) or from a Player
      within the Jurisdiction of its Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would permit a 
      Compact to require a transfer prohibited by this Rule.

Rule 1514 and 1515 are hereby Repealed.

{Comment: Allows multiple treasuries.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Compact Defaults"
(it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if
such Category exists.)

      The Compact of an Organization can specify any or all of the
      following.

        i) How the Compact, and/or the Name of its Organization, can be
           Changed. If this is not specified, it may only be changed by
           unanimous consent of Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.
           Consent is shown by a Player by sending an identical copy of the
           change to the Notary.  The change takes effect when the last
           Player so consents.

           In all cases, when the Name of an Organization changes, the
           Administrator must inform the Notary of the new Name As Soon
           As Possible.

       ii) How the Organization can be dissolved.  If this is not 
           specified, the Organization cannot dissolve unless it is 
           required to do so by the Rules.
           
           As Soon As Possible after an Organization's dissolution, the
           Player who was the last Administrator of that Organization must
           inform the Notary of that Organization's dissolution 

      iii) How additional Players enter the Jurisdiction of the Compact.
           If this is not specified, the Compact cannot expand its
           Jurisdiction.

       iv) How individual Players leave the Jurisdiction of the Compact.
           If this is not specified, the Compact can only lose
           Jurisdiction over a Player when the Rules require it to do
           so.

           Whenever there is any change in a Compact's Jurisdiction, the
           Administrator of its Organization must inform the Notary of the
           change As Soon As Possible.

           These defaults defer to language applying to a specific
           Class of Organization.


Rule 1324 is hereby repealed.


{Comment:  I believe these default-type rules have some value, (so do the
           drafters of the original legislation, each of which contains such
           a default list) in that if someone passes a one line Rule: "There
           exists a Class of Organization known as [blah]" they actually
           give that anemic Organization something of a form.}

           NOTE: this will change the Vizier's responsibilities in the case
           of Groups.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Treasuries of Dissolving
Organizations" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if
such Category exists.)

      If an Organization is to dissolve, and if a provision exists within
      its Compact for dividing its Treasuries (if any) upon dissolution, the 
      Treasuries are divided in accordance with this provision before its
      dissolution.  Otherwise, the Treasuries are divided as evenly as
      possible among all Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction before
      its dissolution.

      The Executor of the Organization notifies all appropriate    
      Recordkeepors of the above Transfers.  If no Executor exists, and 
      there is no provision in the Rules or the Compact for someone to 
      act as Executor, all Treasuries' contents go to the Bank. (Detected 
      by the relevant Recordkeepors.)

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules demanding a different  
      distribution of such Treasuries' assets.

{Comment: This is a consolidation of the language in Groups and
          Contests.  Made timing explicit.  Possible multiple
          treasuries.}


Amend Rule 1397 to read as follows:

      An Organization ceases to exist when any of the following 
      conditions become true:

        i) Its Compact ceases to have Jurisdiction over any Players
           and no provision exists for the Jurisdiction to expand.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would result in 
           the absence of a Administrator (and/or the absence of an 
           Executor in the case of a Orginization with Treasuries) with no 
           provision for any Player to fulfill the role(s).
      iii) The Organization is required to dissolve in accordance with its 
           Compact or the Rules.

      At the moment an Organization dissolves, the following occurs, in 
      order.

        i) Any Currencies remaining in the Organization's Treasuries (if 
           such exist) are distributed as provided for by other Rules.  
       ii) All Players cease to be within the Jurisdiction of the
           Organization's Compact.
      iii) The Organization's Treasuries, Compact, and the Organization
           itself, cease to exist.
  
      Whenever a Public Organization dissolves, the Notary shall report 
      that event to the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after e is notified
      as required by other Rules.

      Other Rules may define additional causes of dissolution.


Amend 1501 to read as follows:

      An Organization is Public unless the Rules defining its Class
      permit (or require) it to be Private.

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an Organization
      is Public unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      The Compact of a Public Organization must be provided by the 
      Administrator of that Organization to any Player on demand. If,
      between the time of the demand and the time the Administrator
      fulfills the demand, the Compact has changed, the Administrator
      must provide the Compact as it existed at the time of the demand,
      and must additionally document every change made to the Compact
      between the demand and its fulfillment.

Amend 1459 to read as follows:

      An Organization can only be Private if the Rules defining its Class
      permit (or require) it to be Private. 

      If its Class permits Privacy, but does not require it, an Organization
      is not Private unless its Compact claims Privacy.

      The Compact of a Private Organization are privileged, and may only 
      be divulged by Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction.  
      (This defers to the Compact where it forbids such disclosure.)

      The following are the only legal exceptions:

        i) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Player 
           within its Jurisdiction.
       ii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to the current 
           Notary.
      iii) Disclosure of any part of the Compact to a Judge or
           Justice judging a CFJ, where the Caller of the CFJ is a Player 
           within the Compact's Jurisdiction, and the evidence 
           provided by the Caller of the CFJ contains text purported to 
           be part or all of the Compact.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would require any 
      Player to provide the Compact of a Private Organization upon
      request.


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Compacts as Evidence"
(it is placed in the Category "Organizations and Compacts" if
such Category exists.)

      If a Judge or Justice requires disclosure of part of any
      Organization's Compact to em for the purpose of Judging a CFJ, the
      Administrator of that Organization is required to provide a copy of
      that Compact to the Judge or Justice As Soon As Possible after the
      Judge's or Justice's request.

      If this involves a Compact from a Private Organization, the Judge or
      Justice receiving it is bound by the strictures governing the
      dissemination of the contents of that Compact, and is prohibited
      from attaching a copy of it to eir Judgement as evidence.
      
      This takes precedence over any Rule which would require a Judge or
      Justice to include the Compact of a Private Organization as part
      of the evidence justifying eir Ruling.

{Comment: I split one of the long Contract Rules in half (the 
          created Rule is the Judging half of the Confidential Contracts 
          Rule)  I stick, mostly, to a generalized version of the 
          original Rule's language.}


Amend Rule 1458 to read as follows:

      There shall exist an Officer called the Notary.  The Notary shall 
      generally be responsible for maintaining a Record of Organizations
      and the Players under the Jurisdiction of their Compacts.

      The Notary shall maintain an up-to-date list of the Names of all
      Organizations, and an up-to-date list of the Players under the
      Jurisdiction of the Compacts of those Organizations.

      E Shall also keep track of the Administrators of each
      Organization, and the Executors of those Organizations with
      Treasuries.

      The Notary's Salary shall be 5 Points per Nomic Week.

Rules 715 and 1516 are hereby Repealed


Amend Rule 717 to Read as follows:


      Not less than once each Nomic Week, the Notary must post a report 
      of all Public Organizations in the Public Forum.

      This report shall contain:
        i) The Name and Class of each Public Organization.
       ii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Public Organization's
           Compact.
      iii) The identity of the Administrator of each Public Organization.
       iv) The identity of the Executor of each Public Organization
           which has Treasuries.

{Comment: Generalized the Group report Rule to cover all Public
          Statutes, disposed of the redundant Statute-reporting
          language.  Allowed for possibility of multiple Treasuries.
          Changed Administrator of [Compact] to Administrator of
          the Organization.}


Amend the first paragraph of Rule 1500 to read as follows:

      When a CFJ alleging that a Statute or a Warranty (hereinafter the
      Target) should be interpreted in a certain way is Judged TRUE, the
      Judge may include with the Judgement an Injunction requiring the 
      Administrator of the Organization whose Compact contains the Target
      to annotate the Target with the Statement in the CFJ.

{Comment: Generalized the language to cover the new Statute/Warranty
          language, and also fixed it so individual Statutes can be
          interpreted and annotated, not just the entire Compact.}


Amend rule 1457 to read as follows:

      When any Player within the Jurisdiction of a Compact believes 
      the Compact to have been Violated by another Player, e shall 
      inform the Administrator of that Compact's Organization of that
      belief, along with the nature of the Violation, the Violated text of
      the Compact, and the identity of the Violating Player. The
      Administrator shall then, As Soon As Possible, distribute this
      information to all Players within the Jurisdiction of the Violated
      Compact.

      If, within seven days of this distribution, no Player within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Administrator 
      shall declare the Compact Violated.  The Administrator is then 
      allowed to initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the 
      Rules and eir Organization's Compact.

      If, however, any Player under the Compact's Jurisdiction 
      disputes the claim of Violation within seven days, then any Player 
      within the Compact's Jurisdiction may submit a Call for 
      Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has Violated the 
      Compact. Such a Call for Judgement cannot be made in any other 
      circumstance.

      All Players within the Compact's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      In the event that such a CFJ is found TRUE, the Compact has 
      been Violated and the Compact's Administrator shall perform the 
      same duties as when no Player contests the claim.  In the event 
      that such a CFJ is found FALSE, the Player which called the CFJ 
      shall lose 5 Marks to the Bank; this transfer shall be detected and 
      reported by the Administrator of the Compact's Organization, if the
      Organization does not possess a Treasury, by its Executor otherwise.


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Definition of Violation"
(it is placed in the Category "Definitions")

      Violation of a Compact means the failure to obey (insofar the Rules
      require) the text of a Compact by a Player within that Compact's
      Jurisdiction. Such a Violation is either Civil or Basic.

      Violations of a Statute are Basic Violations can also be Violations
      of the Rules empowering the Violated Statutes.

      Violations of a Warranty are Civil Violations are never, by
      themselves, Rule Violations.

      Any other Violation is Basic, unless the Rules define it otherwise.
     
{Comment: Since a Contract's Compact consists of Warranties, not
          Statutes, no one could now interpret a Contract violation as
          voided by these Rules.  Added the last sentence to keep from
          hijacking the term "violation" from Rules referring to Rules.}


========================================================================

The following is the new language specific to each defined Class of Organization.  Where the above rules now apply broadly to all Statutes, the following is the (only) Class-specific language left.

The obvious benefit is that an Organization can be defined with one or two Rules.

(Groups are spread into a lot of little Rules, but could be re-written into one or two were we proposing them after this reform.)

========================================================================

Contests.


Amend Rule 1446 to read as follows:

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Contest, also known as
      a subgame of Agora Nomic.

      A Contest's Compact is known as its Regulations, its Administrator is
      known as the Contestmaster, it has one Treasury known as the Contest
      Fund, and its Executor is the Contestmaster.

      Players, other than the Contestmaster, within the Regulation's
      Jurisdiction are known as its Contestants.  The Contestmaster is
      always within the Regulations' Jurisdiction.

      The Foundor of a Contest is its initial Contestmaster.  A 
      Contest is Public, and the Notary must publish the initial Contest 
      Name and Regulations in the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after 
      e receives them from the Contestmaster.

{Comment: In all deference to Kelly's complaint about changing the reporting
          procedures for Contests, IMHO, if an Officer must keep track of an
          entity, changes in the entity--especially creations of that
          entity-- should be required to be reported to the Officer.
          Especially true if the PF is being heavily used for other things,
          like Protos.}


Let the Following Rule be Created with the Title: "Regulations and Membership of
Contests" (it is placed in the Category "Organizations: Contests" if
such Category exists.)


      A Contest's Regulations consist only of Statutes, any one of which is
      referred to as a Regulation. No Player within Jurisdiction of a
      Contest's Regulations is bound by a Regulation or combination of
      Regulations that conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become 
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified, the 
           Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If 
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the Rules 
           require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be 
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and   
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A   
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the   
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting   
      a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e 
      ceases to be Contestmaster.

{Comment: This is similar to the existing Contest Rule, modified
          to fit the new framework, merely split in half.}

======================================================================

Groups.


Amend 766 to read as follows:

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Group.

      A Group's Compact consists only of Statutes, and are known
      collectively as its Ordinances, an individual Statute of its Compact
      is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as the Group's
      Ordinancekeepor.  A Group has one Treasury, and its Executor is known
      as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group has an associated form of Currency.  The generic name of 
      all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific name of a Group's 
      Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      Players within the Ordinances' Jurisdiction are known as the
      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of the
      Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must be a
      Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.


Amend 716 to read as follows:

      To form a Group, there must be three or more Foundors.  In 
      addition to what other Rules require them to provide to the Notary, 
      the Foundors must also specify the following information:

       i) A complete list of the initial Membership of the Group.  No 
          Player on this list may be a Member of any other Group.
      ii) The identity of the initial Ordinancekeepor and Vizier.

      A Group is Public, and as soon as possible after the Notary has 
      received the required information from the third Foundor e shall 
      then post in the Public Forum that the Group has been formed, along 
      with its Name, Membership, and the identity of the Vizier and
      Ordinancekeepor. 


Amend 719 to Read as follows:

      A Player not affiliated with any Group may become a Member of a  
      Group at any time after creation of the Group, subject to the
      following  restrictions:

        i) Membership procedures in the Ordinances are void if they 
           conflict with the Rules.
       ii) No Player shall become a Member of a Group without eir sending 
           a request for Membership to the Vizier of that Group.
      iii) A Player may never be a Member of more than one Group.

      Other Rules, and the Ordinances, may Provide additional 
      Restrictions on Membership.


Amend Rule 718 to read as follows:

      A Player may resign from a Group of which e is a Member, at any 
      time, by sending such a message to the Notary and the Group's 
      Vizier. This rule takes precedence over all other Rules concerning 
      Groups.


Amend Rule 721 to read as follows:

      No Member of any Group is bound to observe any Ordinance or set of 
      Ordinances that conflict with the Rules.

      The Ordinances of a Group may specify the following:

        i) The Vizier of the Group, so long as the Vizier is a Member of 
           that Group.  If the Ordinances of a Group do not so specify, 
           the Vizier shall be the Player whose Application for that 
           Group was received first by the Notary, if e is still a Member 
           of that Group.
       ii) The Ordinancekeepor of the Group, so long as the 
           Ordinancekeepor is a Member of that Group.  If the Ordinances 
           do not so specify, then the Vizier of that Group shall also be 
           its Ordinancekeepor.
      iii) How the Members of the Group shall determine the manner in 
           which the Group shall cast its Group votes. If the Ordinances 
           do not so specify, the Group is prohibited from casting Group 
           votes. The Group is also prohibited from casting any votes on 
           a Proposal if it was not in existence at the beginning of the 
           Voting Period of that Proposal, or if it has less than three 
           Members. The Group's Vizier is responsible for informing the 
           Assessor of how the Group votes on a Proposal.



========================================================================

Contracts.


Amend Rule 1455 to read as follows:

      Let there be a class of Organization known as a Contract, whose
      Compact can also be referred to as a Contract.

      A Contract consists only of Warranties, which are known as its Terms,
      the Players within its Jurisdiction are known as the Parties to the
      Contract, and the Administrator for all Contracts is the Notary.

      Contracts do not possess Treasuries, nor do they possess Executors.
      
      Contracts have the legal force to impose penalties upon Parties 
      that do not abide by the Terms of the Contract.  Parties that are 
      unwilling or unable to abide by the Terms are said to be in Breach 
      of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify the following:

        i) What actions the parties to the contract are required to     
           perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what     
           conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
       ii) What penalties are imposed upon a party who Breaches the     
           Contract.

      The Foundors of a Contract must be the set of all Parties to the 
      Contract. In addition to what other Rules require them to provide 
      to the Notary, the Foundors must also specify the following 
      information:

       i) The identity of each Party to the Contract, each of whom must 
           be named in the Terms of the Contract itself.

      Providing a unique Name for the Contract is optional, this takes
      precedence over the general requirements for information provided.  If
      no Name is provided, the Notary must provide a unique Name for the
      Contract and provide this Name to all Parties.  Parties can then
      change the Name as provided for in the Contract or in other Rules.

      A Contract is Private, and the Notary shall send a notification to 
      all  the Parties of a Contract As Soon As Possible after it has 
      been legally  entered into.  The Contract shall be in force no 
      sooner than the moment of that notification.  

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in 
      accordance with its Terms, or one or more of the Parties of the 
      Contract ceases to  be a Player, or the Contract is breached as 
      described elsewhere.

      When a Contract is changed (including any change in the Parties) a 
      current Party to the Contract must inform the Notary of the change 
      as soon as possible after it occurs.  If a Party is being added to, 
      or removed from, the Contract, the change only has effect if _that_ 
      Party sends the notification.  The Notary shall forward this 
      notification of change to all current Parties  of the Contract As 
      Soon As Possible thereafter.

{Comment: Added the paragraph to deal with names.  (There's, as yet, no set
          way to unambiguously identify individual Contracts.)}


Amend Rule 1456 to read as follows:


      A Contract is Breached if any party to the Contract fails, for any 
      reason, to perform any action required of em by the Contract, or 
      performs, for any reason, any action prohibited of em by the  
      Contract. A Breach is officially determined when the Notary finds a  
      Player in Violation of the Contract's Terms, as described in
      other Rules.

      If a Party cannot fulfill the Terms of the Contract because to do 
      so would  conflict with the Rules, e is required to Breach the 
      Contract and must suffer the penalties for a Breach. (This applies 
      even if other Rules absolve the Party from obeying the Terms.)

      The following shall take place in the event that a party of a   
      Contract breaches that contract:

        i) 20 Marks shall be immediately transferred from the breaching       
           Player to the Bank.
       ii) The breaching Player shall gain 3 Blots.
      iii) 30 Marks shall be divided as evenly as possible and       
           transferred from the breaching Player to each of the other       
           parties of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify additional penalties which are to be   
      imposed in the event of a breach; however, such penalties shall   
      be limited to the transfer of Currencies from the party who 
      breached the Contract to any or all of the other Parties of the 
      Contract.

      The Notary shall be responsible for reporting all Currency and 
      Blot changes which arise as a result of this Rule.

      In the event of a breach, the Notary shall have the authority to   
      order all specifically enumerated Currency transfers required by 
      the Rules pertaining to Contracts and by the Contract which has 
      been Breached. This authority is limited to ordering the transfer 
      of Currencies from the Party in breach to the Bank and/or to other 
      Parties of the Contract.

----------------------------------------

Rule 766/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Groups

      A Group is initially formed by a set of Players which has
      registered with the Registrar to form a Group; other Players may
      join later.  Each Group has a Name, a Membership, a Vizier,
      an Ordinancekeepor, a Treasury, an Initial Set of Ordinances,
      and an associated form of Currency, called the <name> Coins,
      where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      1.  The Name may not be the Name of another Group.

      2.  The Membership is a set of Players;  these Players are
      Members of the Group, and all other Players are not.

      3.  Synchronously with the registration of a Group, two
      positions are created known as the <name> Vizier and the <name>
      Ordinancekeepor, where <name> is the Name of the Group. These
      positions are not Offices, and they may only be held by members
      of the Group. These positions may never be vacant while the
      Group remains in existence.

      The Vizier shall inform the Registrar whenever the Membership
      of the Group or the Ordinancekeepor of the Group changes. When
      the Vizier of the Group changes, the new Vizier shall inform
      the Registrar of the change.

      The Ordinancekeepor shall keep an accurate and up to date
      record of the current Ordinances of the Group.

      4.  The Treasury is a repository for Points and Currencies and
      has the same capabilities for holding, trading, and spending
      Points and Currencies as does a Player.

      5.  The Ordinances are a description of the operation of the
      Group.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1446/4 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      A contest is a subgame of Agora Nomic, having its own Name,
      Entry Fee, Regulations, Contestmaster, and Contest Fund.

      It is created when a Player posts to the Public Forum an
      announcement of the contest, including the Name and Regulations.
      Participants in the subgame are called Contestants of that
      contest.  The player making the post becomes the Contestmaster.

      The Contestmaster for a given Contest is a Player who has
      responsibility for administering the subgame.  He reports all
      currency transfers taking place under the Regulations, is the
      Executor of the Contest Fund, and maintains the Regulations.

      The Contest Fund is a Treasury, as provided for in other Rules.
      The owner of this Treasury is the Contest, and the Executor of
      this Treasury is, at all times, the Contestmaster of the
      Contest.

      The Regulations specify the operation of the Contest.  All
      Contestants, and the Contestmaster, are bound by the Regulations
      except where these conflict with the Rules.  They may also
      specify:
        1. how a Contestmaster is replaced. However, no person may
           become Contestmaster without eir consent;
        2. how the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent, so
           long as this does not conflict with the Rules;
        3. the amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of one or more Currency;
        4. additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants, 
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants;
        5. how the Regulations may be changed.  If they do not so 
           specify, the Regulations may not be changed. Whenever the 
           Regulations are changed, the Contestmaster must post the 
           new Regulations to the Public Forum, and no such change is
           effective until it is so posted;
        and
        6. how the Contest may be dissolved.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster, or by so posting to the Public Forum.  A
      Contestmaster may resign at any time by posting a message to
      that effect to the Public Forum, at which time e ceases to be
      Contestmaster.

      A contest is dissolved when there is no Contestmaster and no
      provision for replacing em, or upon unanimous agreement of the
      Contestmaster and all Contestants, or as otherwise provided in
      the rules, or in the Regulations.  When this happens the Contest
      Fund is distributed as provided in the Regulations; if no
      provision is made the Fund is divided equally between the
      Contestants. 

      No Blots shall be assigned by this Rule.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      A Contract is a Nomic Entity which has the legal force to
      require one or more Players to perform any action, or
      face penalties for Breach of Contract.

      Only Players may be parties to a Contract.

      A Contract must specify the identities of all Players who
      are parties of the Contract.  A Contract may also specify any or
      all of the following:

      * How the Contract may be changed; if this is not specified, the
        Contract may not be changed after it has been enacted.
      * How the Contract may be dissolved; if this is not specified,
        the Contract may only be dissolved as specified in the Rules.
      * How additional parties may be joined to the Contract after it
        has been enacted; if this is not specified, additional parties
        may not be added to the Contract after it has been enacted.
      * How a party to the Contract may be released from the Contract;
        if this is not specified, no party of the Contract may be
        released from the Contract while the Contract continues to
        exist.
      * What actions the parties to the contract are required to
        perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what
        conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
      * What penalties are imposed upon a party who breaches the
        Contract.

      A new Contract is entered into only when the Notary has received
      identical copies of the Contract from every party named in the
      Contract.  The Notary shall send a notification to all parties
      of a contract as soon as possible after it has been legally
      entered into.  The Contract shall be in force no sooner than the
      moment of that notification.  

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in
      accordance with its own terms, or one or more of the parties of
      the Contract ceases to to be a Player, or the Contract is
      breached as described elsewhere.

      Whenever a Contract is changed in any way (including the
      addition of new parties to, or release of existing parties
      from), some party of the Contract must notify the Notary of the
      change as soon as possible after it occurs.  In the case of a
      party being added to Contract, the change only has effect if
      that new party sends the notification to the Notary.  The
      Notary shall forward this notification of change to all parties
      (including new parties and former parties, if appropriate) of
      the Contract as soon as possible thereafter.

      No Contract may be interpreted in such a way as to have any
      legal force on a Player who is not a party of the contract, or
      such that it requires a Player to be joined as a Party of the
      Contract.  No term of a Contract may have retroactive effect.

----------------------------------------

Rule 766/3 (Mutable, MI=1)
Groups

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Group.

      A Group's Compact consists only of Statutes, and are known
      collectively as its Ordinances, an individual Statute of its Compact
      is known as an Ordinance.  Its Administrator is known as the Group's
      Ordinancekeepor.  A Group has one Treasury, and its Executor is known
      as the Group's Vizier.

      A Group has an associated form of Currency.  The generic name of 
      all Group Currencies is "Coins."  The specific name of a Group's 
      Currency is <name> Coins, where <name> is the Name of the Group.

      Players within the Ordinances' Jurisdiction are known as the
      Group's Membership.  Both the Vizier and the Ordinancekeepor of the
      Group must be Members of the Group.  At all times there must be a
      Vizier and Ordinancekeepor for every Group.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1446/5 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contests

      Let there be a Class of Organization known as a Contest, also known as
      a subgame of Agora Nomic.

      A Contest's Compact is known as its Regulations, its Administrator is
      known as the Contestmaster, it has one Treasury known as the Contest
      Fund, and its Executor is the Contestmaster.

      Players, other than the Contestmaster, within the Regulation's
      Jurisdiction are known as its Contestants.  The Contestmaster is
      always within the Regulations' Jurisdiction.

      The Foundor of a Contest is its initial Contestmaster.  A 
      Contest is Public, and the Notary must publish the initial Contest 
      Name and Regulations in the Public Forum As Soon As Possible after 
      e receives them from the Contestmaster.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1455/1 (Mutable, MI=1)
Contracts

      Let there be a class of Organization known as a Contract, whose
      Compact can also be referred to as a Contract.

      A Contract consists only of Warranties, which are known as its Terms,
      the Players within its Jurisdiction are known as the Parties to the
      Contract, and the Administrator for all Contracts is the Notary.

      Contracts do not possess Treasuries, nor do they possess Executors.
      
      Contracts have the legal force to impose penalties upon Parties 
      that do not abide by the Terms of the Contract.  Parties that are 
      unwilling or unable to abide by the Terms are said to be in Breach 
      of the Contract.

      A Contract may specify the following:

        i) What actions the parties to the contract are required to     
           perform, or are prohibited from performing, and under what     
           conditions these requirements or prohibitions have force.
       ii) What penalties are imposed upon a party who Breaches the     
           Contract.

      The Foundors of a Contract must be the set of all Parties to the 
      Contract. In addition to what other Rules require them to provide 
      to the Notary, the Foundors must also specify the following 
      information:

       i) The identity of each Party to the Contract, each of whom must 
           be named in the Terms of the Contract itself.

      Providing a unique Name for the Contract is optional, this takes
      precedence over the general requirements for information provided.  If
      no Name is provided, the Notary must provide a unique Name for the
      Contract and provide this Name to all Parties.  Parties can then
      change the Name as provided for in the Contract or in other Rules.

      A Contract is Private, and the Notary shall send a notification to 
      all  the Parties of a Contract As Soon As Possible after it has 
      been legally  entered into.  The Contract shall be in force no 
      sooner than the moment of that notification.  

      A Contract ceases to have force at the moment it is dissolved in 
      accordance with its Terms, or one or more of the Parties of the 
      Contract ceases to  be a Player, or the Contract is breached as 
      described elsewhere.

      When a Contract is changed (including any change in the Parties) a 
      current Party to the Contract must inform the Notary of the change 
      as soon as possible after it occurs.  If a Party is being added to, 
      or removed from, the Contract, the change only has effect if _that_ 
      Party sends the notification.  The Notary shall forward this 
      notification of change to all current Parties  of the Contract As 
      Soon As Possible thereafter.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1533/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Creation of Organizations, and Their Compacts

      Organizations (and, simultaneously, their initial Compacts) are
      created in the following manner:

      A set of Players, known as the Foundors, sends a message to the 
      Notary containing the following information:

         i) The Class of the created Organization.
        ii) The Unique Name of the particular Organization being created.
       iii) The inital Compact for the proposed Orginization.
        iv) Any information required by Rules governing that specific
            Class of Organization.

      The Organization is created and is in force once the Notary
      receives the above information from all required Foundors.

      The set of required Foundors is specified within the Rules defining
      the particular Class of Organization, but they must be from within
      the Jurisdiction of the new Organization's Compact. Additional
      restrictions on the set of Foundors can be made by those Rules.

      This Rule defers when other Rules specifically claim precedence over
      its requirements. Otherwise, these requirements take precedence.

----------------------------------------

Rule 1011/0 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      Any Entity which is created by the Nomic Rules, and which exists
      only within the context of Agora Nomic (such as Points, Votes,
      Currencies and any Official Records) may *not* be changed by any
      action other than those specified by the Rules.

      No two Nomic Entities (including Players) shall have the same
      name or nickname.

I disagree. Morendil clearly wrote '... I issue Injunctions...' (plural).
He didn't specify the exact number, but one for each Officer seems most
logical.

I don't see anything specifying when I have to report the Infraction. I have
to execute the POs immediately upon report of the Infraction, but I don't
regard these statements to be report of Infractions. But I agree that that
can be disputed.

Rule 478 (Excerpt):

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

If every player is subscribed to agora-discussion, then sending something
to a-d implies sending it to every Active Player, and thus sending it to
the PF.

I disagree with this interpretation; Rule 663 allows an Injunction to
apply to multiple Players.

If it is is 44 appeals, then you need to assign it to the Appeals
Board 44 times.

I think that Calabresi's message can be reasonably considered to have
been captioned as being intended as a Public Forum message.

Yes, that is probably true.

As Vlad has already stated, there is no necessary inconsistency in that.
There are still 2 Amendments, there is just (in at least some philosophies
on this question), no time for any effects to 'fire' between they are
taking place. I understand this is the position argued by General Chaos and
Vlad. For myself, I too am inclined to take this approach, with the remark
that I do agree with elJefe's appelate Judgement that this doesn't
imply that CFJ 933 should be FALSE.

I have to own up to being the source of Andre's confusion. I thought
Elde was automatically deregistered for Lawlessness, but it appears
that this isn't automatic - someone has got to snitch to the PF for
this to happen - and I made my dismissal conditional on Elde being a
Player.

Technically, in one sense, they are, since I am. Any post that
reaches me has been read by the Executor of Blob and Elde, and in 
principle (read legal fiction) I am acting "as if I were" them.

I think that 663 allows you to lump them as one Injunction. But it 
doesn't really make a difference, does it ?

of required actions is empty.  For example, neither the Rulekeepor nor
the Archivist have, to the best of my knowledge, ever executed a
Payment Order in the context of their Officers.  Also, there are some
Payment Orders that may have been executed by Players who were
Officers at the time they were Executed, but were not Officers at the
time Morendil's Injunctions were proclaimed.

Not all Players are currently subscribed to a-d. Blob and Elde at 
least are not. 

I don't think Elde is subscribed to the Public Forum, either.
Would that put him in violation of some Rules?

R663 allows a single Injunction to name more than one Player. I therefore
concur with General Chaos that there were four Injunctions only.

..."provided that the message bears a clear indication that it is
intended to be a message to the Public Forum".

Calabresi's message does, in my opinion, bear such an indication
(Jeff's worries notwithstanding). However, not all Players are currently
s-bscribed to a-d, so the point is moot.

I think that *is* inconsistent. Why should we think that the
modification to a Rule caused by the first of two amendments lasts
long enough to have legal significance, but that the modification to
the game state caused by the first of two amendments does not? The
only attempt at an answer given so far is that "Rule Changes are
special", but we've seen nothing which justifies this blatantly ad
hoc maneouvre.

This is an interesting situation. Let's examine it in a little more
detail.

My current view is that there does not at present exist even a
legal fiction to the effect that Elde or Blob are s-bscribed
to agora-discussion. They uns-bscribed themselves, and you have
done nothing since, acting as their Executor, to alter this.

What would be the effect of your announcing in the PF "As Elde's
Executor, I hereby s-bscribe to agora-discussion." Well, it certainly
wouldn't have the effect of really s-bscribing Elde to a-d. But
you will rightly say that that is hardly the point, which is that you
are attempting to establish a legal fiction that Elde is s-bscribed.

But can you succeed in doing even that? Not, I think, by sending that
message to the PF. R1478 tells us that under certain circumstances,
we are to take messages from you as if they were from Elde. Very well.
But Elde also cannot subscribe to a-d by sending a message to the PF.
To do that, he would have to send a message to majordomo@gecko.

The next question should be obvious: what if you were to send a
message to majordomo@gecko, acting as Elde's Executor? Majordomo,
of course, knows nothing of your Executorship and would refuse
your request, since the address being subscribed would not match
the address of the subscriber, and bounce it to me, as list
administrator. My responsibilities in that case would be unclear.

One might argue that that I am required to honour the request,
since R1478 requires me to treat certain messages from you as if
they were from Elde. I have two objections to such an argument:
firstly, it's not at all clear that the Rules would require me to
honour such a request even if it genuinely came from Elde. Of course
other things being equal, it would be rude, uncooperative and
dishonourable of me not to honour a genuine request (and other things
are not equal), but it would not actually be illegal. Secondly, it's
worth noting that although R1478 might require me to treat certain
messages from you as if they were from Elde, this request for
approval of a subscription is not a message from you, but a message
from majordomo@gecko, and that therefore R1478 can impose no
obligations on me regarding it. 

So I conclude that the Rules don't require me to honour such
requests. Ordinarily, of course, I do honour such requests, but this
is not an ordinary case. I happen to know that neither Malcolm nor
Derek wish to be s-bscribed, and I would hesitate to annoy them by
subscribing them.

However, this is not the end of the story. You could, in my opinion,
send a message to the Registrar, acting on behalf of Elde as eir
Executor, changing his email address to yours. I think R1478 would
require the Registrar to treat this message as genuine. You would
then have reasonable grounds for claiming that you had established
a legal fiction to the effect that Elde is s-bscribed.

Well, then, is Elde in fact Lawless? Does it depend, as so much else
on the final outcome of CFJ 933?

If I remember Crito's hypothetical report correctly, if the Judgement
is sustained, then Elde will have 30 Blots. To be Lawless, you have to
have "more than 30" (R1714). Would Herald Crito care to comment on
these figures?

Rule 478, yes.  However, the wording of Rule 478 suggests that the
_permanent_ inability of a Player to receive a medium designated as a
the Public Forum might serve to deprive that medium of "legal
significance as a Public Forum".

The question is when they may have legal significance. The Rules can
clearly act on a proposal before it is enacted...to determine the legality
of the provisions. They can act on a Proposal after it is enacted...to 
trigger the Repeal bonus and count amendments. But can they act *as* it is
being enacted? This is the question at hand, although I must reiterate
there is no particular reason to think the answer is the same in all
circumstances. The argument "Rule Changes are special", is weak and ad
hoc, but since the Rules are silent, it is just as valid as any other.
