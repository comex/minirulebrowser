That reading is certainly permissible, but it's not forced. One
could argue that it is perfectly possible to apply the provision
"In Rule R, replace A with B" to R, even when A does not appear in R.
The result is simply no change to the text of the Rule, but the
provision has still been applied (since the zero occurrences of A
have been replaced). Indeed, it seems that this is how R594 has been
hitherto interpreted.

One might legitimately ask: if this is not an example of an 
inapplicable provision, what would be? If there were no answer
to that question, I think we'd have good grounds for thinking
that the Chuck's new interpretation is probably forced and not
just permissible. But I can think of an answer to the question.
A provision which awarded Currencies to an ex-Player (assuming
that the Rules at the time made this illegal), would, I think, be
an example of an inapplicable provision.

Personally, I can see no use in distinguishing between a provision
of a Rule which says "X is three." and one which says "This Rule
makes X three." This is a distinction without a difference, since
both have the identical result that X is given the value three by the
Rule. I can't see any principled reason to privilege one of these
provisions over the other. They speak with equal voices. Hence in my
view, the sequence of provisions "X is three. This Rules makes X
four." is in the first place directly self-contradictory, and in the
second place, exactly as self-contradictory as the sequences "This
Rule makes X four. X is three.", "X is three. X is four." and "X is
four. X is three.", and so on.

But "replace A with B" is not equivalent to "replace all occurrences
of A with B."  I can't recall if this has ever occurred, but
it has always been my interpretation that "replace A with B"
is ambiguous if A appears more than once in a Rule.  In other words,
I think the natural interpretation of "replace A with B" is "replace
the one single occurrence of A with B."

But the fact that 594 instructs that provisions are to be applied
to the maximal extent allowed by the Rules already prevents that.
I would ask: if this is not an example of an inapplicable provision,
what would be an inapplicable provision that is not already prevented
by other parts of 594?

I think there is a reasonable legal presumption, not yet overturned
by the courts, that P3710 has not yet passed.

I'm willing to take Assessor's reports as prima facie evidence
on the status of Proposals.  However, prima facie means that
the evidence is sufficent *if there is no evidence to the contrary*.
In the current case, there is evidence to the contrary.

I would agree; when I have intended for a replacement to be repeated,
I have written words to the effect of "Replace A with B whereever it
occurs".  Why would I find it necessary to use this additional
verbiage if it was not necessary?

Well, I'm glad you're taking it in such a friendly way. I wouldn't
complain too loudly if you did transfer the Kudo from me; on the other
hand I must say that it is not only tardiness (in the legal sense) of
the recordkeepor not to do their job, but also negligence (in a
non-rule defined way) of trustees not to nudge the recordkeepor to do
eir job. I don't think I'll start dekudoing trustees for their
inactivity, but I still don't like the attitude.

It was mostly this willingness of the trustees to ignore their task
(breaking rules in the process or not) instead of doing their job, or
at least resigning, that made me bring the issue up (and may I venture
to suggest that bringing this up more informally wouldn't have
provoked much of a response, at all? No offence intended, but...). I
didn't terribly enjoy being a trustee either, but I still did my job,
although I had other interesting things to do at the time, both in
Agora and in RL.

I'd be most willing to support a repeal of all trustee related
stuff. In fact, I think the job could be done by the notary much more
quickly and efficiently; maybe e can get a salary raise for that. But
then let's change the rules, and not just quietly ignore them.

But, like Scott, I think we
should distinguish failure to pay debts incurred before going On Hold
from failure to pay debts incurred after going On Hold (such as debts
due to commission of PI Infractions), and punish On Hold Players only
for the former.
<<

In that case, it would probably suffice to amend the second sentence
of 1713 to read

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a 
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order 
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.

The last sentence is needed so debtors cannot go on hold at the
beginnig of every week. There will also be a one-off PI penalty for
players who leave debts unpaid when they go on hold.

A question here, and please take this as lightly as I'm writing it:
I've seen you report InterNomic members' attempts to include new members and
make minor revisions to IN's ruleset.  But, pardon my ignorance here,
does InterNomic actually _do_ anything?

If you ask me, and I know you didn't, but I'll tell you anyway:
Internomic is a great idea still waiting to happen.

The major problem with Probate, IMHO, is that it allows the Notary
to dump unwanted duties on Players without even being required to
notify them in person; as it happened, I only found out I was Andre's
Trustee because of your Infraction Report - at least it did that much
good. The Trustee assignment was listed in the Notary's Report, but I
don't as a rule read those very carefully, because I don't have the
time, and I know that the Notary's Report cannot in principle trigger
any obligations as far as I'm concerned. If I'd had the time to find 
out that I had become a Trustee, I might have made a formal inquiry
of the various Recordkeepors.

On the other hand, I think your - commendable - desire to ensure
that the Rules are obeyed compels you to complete the process that
you started, as far as reporting Infractions is concerned.

I would rather think it would be both less efficient and more likely to be
forgotten.

I agree.  The last time the Notary assigned me as a trustee
without my consent--even though I resigned immediately--I
deKudoed em.  And I'd do it again.

That gives me an idea. At present, the Notary doesn't have much
power. We could give the Notary the power to dispose of the assets of
deregistered Players as e sees fit, or, less radically, the power to
dispose of the assets of the deregistered Player who have not
otherwise left instructions as to how their assets should be disposed
of. I kind of like the more radical idea myself, since it'll make the
Notary a genuinely attractive position in its own terms for the first
time since the Zombie scam, and it'd mean we could do away with the
whole apparatus of Wills, and simplify Probate enormously.

According to R1585, which takes precedence of R1686, you *do* have a
whole week to get your act together. So, if I were you, I'd be disputing
the Report of Infraction. On the other hand, it may now have been
more than a week, so maybe the Report is correct after all.

On the second point: Swann, I bounced you all the Scorekeeping messages
I had, and the latest Scorekeepor's Report, as soon as I saw you had
accepted my appointment of you, a week ago. They never bounced back
to me. Are you saying you didn't receive them?

I should have been clearer. You're right, of course, that "replace A
with B" is not equivalent to "replace every occurrence of A with B".
But I don't need to argue that. I think your natural interpretation
is pretty close to the mark. I'd amend it only as follows: "replace
the one single occurrence of A, if it occurs, with B." That is how
I claim R594 been interpreted in the past.

You understand I'm playing devil's advocate here, yes? I don't
really care if you want to adopt your new interpretation of R594.
I'm just interested to see if it's possible to defend our past
practice.

Hm. Interesting question...

There isn't, ordinarily. But, if you parse those sentences literaly, 
there is a difference; and if you take more complicated sentences of 
those varieties, there is a difference. For example: "Steve is 
awarded three goldfish. This rule does not award Steve more goldfish 
than would give Steve five goldfish." versus "Steve is awarded three 
goldfish. Steve is not awarded more goldfish than would give Steve 
five goldfish." In that case, the second phrasing is 
self-contradictory, and the first is not. The only visible 
difference, from my point of view, is the use of the "this rule" 
construction.

> This is a distinction without a difference, since
> both have the identical result that X is given the value three by the

This is a circular argument: Because they have no difference when no 
provision says something else, they mean the same thing, and 
therefore they must have no difference even if some other provision 
says something else.

> I can't see any principled reason to privilege one of these

Because one modifies X, and the other modifies the rule's effect?

> Hence in my

"Directly" self-contradictory? How so? It says one thing about X, and 
one thing about itself. The thing it says about itself says it 
contradicts what it says about X, but that's indirect 
self-contradiction, or in my view, self-modification.

> and in the
> second place, exactly as self-contradictory as the sequences "This

That one I'll agree on. Order doesn't matter. [Usually.]

> "X is three. X is four." and "X is four. X is three.", and so on.

Those, unlike your previous example, says two different things about 
X directly. Perhaps I should be less literal-minded; then again, if 
the construction "X is three. This rule makes X four.", presumably 
in two different sections and with at least one condition on the 
second part, was in an actual rule, I'm sure you would interpret it 
as non-contradictory. As an example, from Rule 452:

"During the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal, Election or 
Referendum [the Vote Collector] is prohibited from making use of any 
knowledge ... e would not have had e not served as Vote Collector, in 
any attempt to influence the result of the vote on the Proposal, 
Election or Referendum.... 

This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting 
... a list of Voting Entities which have already voted or declared 
that they are Present on a given Proposal, Election, or Referendum."

Absent the "This Rule" construction, Rule 452 would be flatly 
contradictory: first it would say that publishing secret knowledge to 
influence a vote is illegal, then it would say that publishing 
certain secret knowledge [presumably to encourage voting, which 
certainly influences the results] is not illegal.

How can you say that when there is an Assessor's Report claiming that
the Proposal passed which has not yet been shown by the Courts to be
in error? (Actually, as of this morning that may no longer be true.)

Indeed there is, and the significance of this evidence is in dispute,
and the dispute is being resolved by the Courts. In the meantime, I
would say that your duty as Rulekeepor lies not in pre-empting any
Judicial decision, but in accepting the prima facie evidence that
the Proposal has passed until the Courts deliver a decision to the

I don't think that an implicit "if it occurs" is part of natural
usage.

Imagine a supervisor telling an employee: "Replace CoolProgram 5.0
with CoolProgram 6.0 on my computer."  (Assume for the sake
of argument that there's no upgrade--5.0 has to be removed
completely, and then 6.0 installed.)  The employee goes to his
boss's computer, and finds that CoolProgram 5.0 is not on it.
Would he do nothing, and go tell his boss, "OK, I did it?"
Certainly not!

(OK, the analogy isn't perfect, since the employee is likely
to install 6.0 anyway.  And neither of us are suggesting that
should be done with the Rule amendment.  But I think it still holds.)

No, I only accept prima facie evidence without question when
there is no conflicting evidence.  That is the nature of
prima facie evidence.

I assume you would not object if I ignored an Assessor's Report
which was quite obviously in error?

The way I see it is that there is evidence in favor of 3710 having
been adopted, and evidence against 3710 having been adopted.
The matter will be settled by the courts.

In the interim, I feel it is my duty to record, as best as I
can determine, the Rule Changes which have been applied.  The
Assessor's Report should be taken into account when determining
what Rule Changes have taken place.  It is not the only evidence
which should be considered.  Nor do I see any reason why the Assessor's
report should be given primacy above all other evidence.

I do not believe it is my duty as Rulekeepor to blindly accept
all Assessor's reports unless they are overturned in the courts.

Rule 1754 does not, in any way, authorize the issuance of Payment
Orders.

I note that, since it is now possible to vacate a Transfer Order, Rule
1754 is probably unnecessary.  (The executor of an inadvertent
Transfer Order can simply vacate it.)

This won't work because R1754 is the one case where an obligation to pay out
from the Bank is imposed without a Payment Order - there will be nothing to
vacate and the obligation will remain.  I'd like to see 1754 amended instead to
limit it to the case where the stated purpose was the satisfaction of a PO, but
the PO could not be satisfied.  I had started to work up a proto.  If you want
I'll go ahead with that as a separate proposal, or you can include something of
the sort here.

My proto essentially causes such an attempted TO to fail, instead of moving
currency back and forth.  If people are interested, I'll put it in proposal
form.

Right you are. It simply requires the Chancellor to make a transfer.

So, should I just add the repeal of R1754 to the proto, then?

Proto-Proposal
Tabula Rasa

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, and with 12 Players
having just won the game courtesy of Chuck's counterscam, *definitely*
too many VTs. Time to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all obligations
      on the Chancellor to transfer Currency incurred under the
      authority of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are
      cancelled. Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any
      Player as Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank)
be repealed.

[Comment: As Scott points out, after Omnibus Reform, this Rule is
superfluous, since Players can vacate inadvertent transfers. So why
keep the reference to R1754 in the provision above if the Rule is
being repealed? Because I'm not sure that the repeal of the Rule
would result in the cancellation of obligations already incurred
under its authority before its repeal.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]

Not that simple.  Being able to vacate a TO leaves that loophole in place even
without R1754.  You'll have to add something that prevents any previously
executed TO from being vacated.

Not unless CFJ 1090 is overturned.  The creation of the Rule
which granted the wins was made conditional on the passage
of P3710.

I'm obviously not au fait with post-Omnibus Reform procedures. Would
someone like to explain to me what would happen if, say, Oerjan, were
to try to get around TR (v1.1) by transferring eir Currencies to the
Bank, and then vacating the transfer? R1802 says that vacating a TO
would permanently deny the vacated TO from having any effect, which
would mean that the Currencies never were transferred to the Bank
after all. Right?

That's a bit worrying, isn't it? What if I transfer 10 VTs to Blob,
he spends them, and then I vacate the transfer?

I agree.  I think it should not be possible to amend, stay, or
vacate a TO later than the earliest time it may be performed.  (Which
means most TOs could not be vacated, amended, or stayed at all, but delayed
TOs (allowed by R1795) could, before the earliest time at which they
could be performed.)

Even so, we're getting close to 400 VTs in circulation, which is
still too many. We are making progress: things aren't nearly as
wildly out of control as they used to be. The number of VTs in
circulation has grown pretty slowly since RGBII. But a moderate
input/output imbalance remains, and the growth, while slow, has been
fairly inexorable. I'm hoping 'Indelible Proposal voting' and
'Encourage VT spending' will both pass, and each should provide a
mild stimulus to expenditures (particularly the latter). That may
close the gap. If not, I'd want to look at two other possibilities:
firstly, getting rid of Presence (suggested by Oerjan). This would
raise the minimum expenditure required to pass a Proposal to Quorum.
Secondly, and I think more attractively, reducing Officer Salaries.
At present, these are putting about 20 VTs/week into circulation, the
major source of VT inputs, and that may be too high. I'd probably try
paring that down to 15 or even 10, and then see how things look.
