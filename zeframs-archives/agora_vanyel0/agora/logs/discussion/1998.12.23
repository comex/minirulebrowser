If you want to be consistent with what I am using, please follow the
following standards:

For text not set out with an indexed subdivision, indent six spaces on
the left margin.  Otherwise the indent is ten spaces plus two spaces
for each sublevel.  The indexing tag hangs into the margin.  Right
margin is always at column 70.

All indexing tags are enclosed in parenthesis.  Do not put two tags on
the same line; if you want a division with no non-subdivided text,
leave the line after the tag blank.

The first level of tags is lowercase letters; use "aa", "bb", etc
after "z".  The second level is digits.  The third level is uppercase
letters.  Fourth and subsequent levels repeat this pattern: hence,
(a)(1)(A)(a)(1).  (I hope that we never need more than three levels.)
I don't use roman numerals because they take up a lot of space.

Blank lines between paragraphs only for first-level and unindexed
paragraphs.  (This is more open to reasonable variation.)

I have a Perl script that takes a marked-up format and prettifies it,
if anyone is interested.

How about making that, say, Without 3 Objections ? Now that we have 
an intermediate between discretionary power and Vox Populi, are we 
going to use it or what ? ;)

Why are you sorry?  That is a good response. I asked because the cases
bear resemblances, and i wanted clarification. I find i am still
disappointed that Steve did not detail his own arguments; i enjoy
reading his point of view and style.  It was rather a shock to see his
argument limited to a paragraph that said basically see what Crito
said.  So my disappointment was personal, and not related to game
custom.

OTOH Crito's arguments on this whole topic have been thorough and well
expressed.  If one agrees with them, it is difficult to actually
contribute more than e did, or rephrase the arguments so that they
remain as clear as when e stated it.  I did not feel up to the task.

Here is a thought that I present only, maybe, half-seriously.  If the end of a
Nominating Period falls within a Holiday, then it is possible to nominate
for an Office by doing it *exacly* 24 hours after the end of the Holiday. 8)

OTOH, the more I read the Rule, it seems to me to grant an automatic
extension of the Nominating Period.  Although the Rules do not
require you to nominate, if you want to, they *do* require you to do it
before the end of the NP.

Excellent. My plan was to produce a default budget (something like 5 VTs
for everyone), which I know you would be unhappy with, in order to
prompt you to produce something better.

I can provide you with a list of POs I've issued as CotC, if that'll be
of any use.
