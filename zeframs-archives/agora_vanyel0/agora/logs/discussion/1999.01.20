I agree with Vlad on this. I also want to be see fairly stable
configurations of Legislators/Voters. So I think a 2 month commitment is
about right.

That will cause oscillations which will make it difficult for a natural
equilibrium to emerge.

I'll certainly be looking at these Rules while preparing the proto.

He probably wanted to sneak back in quietly, but I was so happy to see
his subscription message that I cannot help a little fanfare. I have
just been informed by majordomo@gecko that:

kunne@ipno.in2p3.fr has been added to agora-official.

and the other lists, too. It appears that after an absence of many
years, Ronald Kunne, aka Stella? aka Troublemaker At Large, legendary
Player and scamster of yore, has returned to us.

Welcome back, Ronald! May we expect your registration shortly? I hope
so!

(1) Perhaps there should be another group to which Players may belong, namely
    those eligible to judge CFJs.

(2) This would provide interesting situations when members of the
    non-Proposal-making groups are Required to Serve.

It's not a bad idea, but CFJs are probably too infrequent, and in most
cases, too inconsequential, for any one to be interested in giving up
their rights to vote *and* make Proposals in exchange for the right to
be a Judge.

A Duty to Propose would probably be repealed, or at least amended to
apply only to Legislators - who probably won't need the encouragement.

Talking about which, I cannot for the life of me work out how to use
the egroups interface to search the archives for particular articles.
Am I just being dense?

Well, what's the problem specifically? I used them this morning to find
Morendil's message which quoted his original submission of 'Ruleset Lite
II'. To do that, I went to the archive for the agora-business list
<http://www.egroups.com/list/agora-business/>, and clicked on Author to
sort posts by Author. I found it in a jiffy. You can also sort by Date
and by Subject. It's pretty cool.

I find "reasonably believed that eir actions were not a Crime" to be
somewhat ambiguous in meaning between "did not commit actions which e must
reasonably believe were a Crime" and "reasonably believed that e was not
performing actions which were a Crime".  Under the latter interpretation,
Andre is not guilty, under the former he probably is.

Proto-Proposal
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters. 

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall maintain a record of whether each Player is a
      Legislator or a Voter, and the date and time at which e last
      became either a Legislator or a Voter, and include it eir
      Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R1865 (A Duty to Propose) be repealed.

I believe R103 is the Rule which prevents the Speaker from deregistering
under R113.

The inducement is in the cost of Voting, not in the penalty - certainly
the inducement would be even greater if there was no penalty at all!

We seem to be approaching a system where penalties are the only Currency
amounts that are not set by Officers.  If we were to make those floating
as well (I guess that would mostly be the CotC's privilege...), there
would be no baseline for our Currency values. Of course, that need not be
a bad thing in itself, I did find the old Mil experiment interesting.

This part sparked an idea...

what about a system where Players are Voting Entities only and Groups are
Proposing Entities only?

I suspect that there would be too many people who would join a group
that promised to make a proposal for any of its members whenever a
member wanted a proposal made.

You could perhaps counter this by requiring that Players all vote FOR
proposals made by their Group, or pay some sort of penalty.   

Of course, the above idea could be something a group of people
consisting of a mix of Legislators and Voters could approximate using
the system as currently proposed and the Contract rule (1742).

Michael.

No, that's R1043, which begins "A Voter may deregister from Agora...".
As far as I can see, nothing in R103 prevents the Speaker from
deregistering, as long as other Rules ensure that another Player
immediately becomes Speaker if e does. I'm not sure off hand whether
they actually do or not.

True, but irrelevant. If your choices are to pay 1.2 VTs to vote, or pay
1 VT not to vote, then unless you care a lot about the Proposal, you'll
choose not to vote. In effect, this is precisely the situation which A
Duty to Vote was originally designed to ameliorate, except that "1 VT"
in the above was replaced by "0 VTs". 

I think that people accept the need to induce Players to vote, so I
can't understand why they want to make the Proposal such that in certain
situations it will have precisely the opposite effect.

I know. I didn't really like the feel of that proposal much. I'm not
quite sure why. I did wonder why it set the MUQ to 0.01, and not just 0.1,
however.

Looking further into this question, it appears that the Rules do not
ensure that another Player would immediately become Speaker if for some
reason the Speaker deregistered. So you are correct that R103 prevents
the Speaker from deregistering, though in an oddly indirect way.

Given that we think it desirable that the Speaker not be permitted to
deregister (which is a good idea), it would seem wise to add a provision
to that effect to amendment of R103 in the proto. I'll add such a
provision in the next revision.

The closest thing is R681, which I don't think is enough.

R1043 has only Power 1, and cannot possibly thwart R113 by its own.

Well, I've tried searching for old Assessor's Reports to no avail. 
Half the time it gives me the error "The remote server closed the 
connection before sending any data.", and the other half it presents me
with a list of posts that seem to have little or no relevance to my
query.

Also, I'm not sure what "sort by Subject" means - the results don't appear
to be sorted at all - grouped by subject, yes, but not sorted.

Proto-Proposal
Clearing the ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
May Not Deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Speaker. The Speaker may not
      deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

Because it then falls into the hands of the Assessor to decide how to set
the Voting Tariff, knowing that eir choice not only affects the absolute 
cost of voting, but also the relative cost of not voting. It makes it a 
more interesting trade-off. Do I set it above 1 VT, and risk that players 
would prefer not to vote, or below 1 VT, and lose income based on 
commissions?

Since the whole VT economy could otherwise scale up or down without really
changing relative magnitude, by scaling the Tariff and the BOS by the same
factor, a fixed penalty like this one gives us a peg on which to hang 
everything else. It should mean that, over time, the economy should 
slide towards a voting cost close to 1 VT, while still being allowed to
fluctuate around that value.

It might be an idea to mention that the Speaker is a Player.  :-)

If I were being asked to Judge this, I would ask myself the question:
was it reasonable for Andre to believe that eir actions were not a
Crime? I think the answer to that question would probably have to be
"no". For what happened was that Andre made a mistake, based either in
forgetfulness, or in imperfect knowledge of the Rules, or a combination
of both. In the circumstances, I think it would be perspicacious to
describe this mistake as a "momentary lapse of reason". Andre's belief
was not a reasonable one, because had his reasoning faculties been
operating well, he would not have that belief.

Proto-Proposal
Clearing the ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
may not deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any
      other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.


Be it further resolved that R113 (Players may always opt out) be amended
by replacing the phrase "A Player" with the phrase "A Player other than
the Speaker".

[Since the Proposal has an AI of 3 anyway, I've taken the opportunity to
iron out some of the wrinkles in the Rules about the Speaker and
deregistration. At present, the wise policy of preventing the Speaker
from deregistering is enforced indirectly by R103, and only then because
that Rule takes precedence over R113 in case of a conflict, which there
would be if the Speaker ever tried to claim eir right to deregister
under R113.]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

But you yourself know that this is not an accurate description of the
factors affecting your decision about where to set the Tariff. You've
left out the most important factor, which is the level of the BOS. If
that is set high, then you are virtually forced to set the Tariff
correspondingly high, or risk inflation. At any rate, that was your
reasoning last week.

But never mind. I shall pin my hopes on the Blot penalty being
sufficient inducement to vote.

You've probably forgotten to encase in double quotes keywords in the
search string which must appear next to each other. I tried searching
agora-official for the string

Assessor's Report for Proposals

and got 1002 matches, the first 20 of which were Ruleset posts by Chuck.
Then I tried

"Assessor's Report for Proposals"

and got 55 matches, nearly all of which were in fact posts by the
Assessor reporting the results of Proposals.

They appear to me to be threaded.

Not that that matters, since the Speaker can voluntarily Abandon at
any time and thereby cease to be Speaker.

Sigh... You said it so much more elegant than I did...

Actually the place to look is somewhere else in the Rule. R1575 says I
should have a reasonable belief that I "reasonably believed that my 
actions were not a Crime at the time e performed them..."

Now, there are two ways to read this, which happen to be identical in
most circumstances, but not in this one:

1. I reasonably believed that (my actions were not a crime). This is true.
2. I reasonably believed that (my actions) were not a crime. This is false.

That is, does "my actions" refer to my actual actions? In this case the
defense does not apply. At the time I did so I did believe that transferring
the VT to Steve would be a Crime. Or is the question whether I believed
that "my actions were not a crime"? In that case it does apply. At the time
I did it, I (IMO reasonably) believed that what I did was making a Transfer
Order. And that doing so was not a Crime. So at the time I did not believe
that my actions were a Crime.

Sounds complicated, doesn't it? Natural language is sometimes so
insufficient...

I don't see this - yes, it will cost you less not to vote, but that would
be the case without the duty to vote too. Sometimes committing an Infraction
and bearing the consequences of it may be more favorable than not committing
the Infraction. That does not mean that the Rule defining the Infraction
does induce you to commit it. It still does induce you not to commit it.
It's just that there might be other Rules, or things that are not Rules at
all, that induce one even stronger in another direction.

It doesn't have the opposite effect. So your question goes from a false

Protoproposal Chaos73 [rev. 1]

Standards of Proof

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended to read:

      (a) A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or
          committed a Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the
          evidence is sufficient to be certain of that Judgement
          beyond reasonable doubt.

      (b) In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with
          the preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      (c) Furthermore, it is a complete defense to any accusation of a
          Crime that the Player accused, at the time e performed or
          neglected to perform the actions which constitute the Crime
          accused, reasonably believed that the circumstances were
          such that e was legally permitted to perform or neglect to
          perform those acts.  No Player shall be convicted of a Crime
          if this defense applies.

Yes, I've been thinking about getting groups involved, too. As a first
simple step in this direction, maybe groups could be entities which
are able to be legislators or voters, just like players? When we
restrict voting rights, we'll have to do something about group votes,
anyway.

But what more is there to say than this? It was an innocent mistake,
and therefore not a crime. Of course it is fun to dive into the rules
and pick nits, but in the present case it seems to me there is little
point in a microscopic analysis of the rules texts, when the overall
statement and meaning of the rule is so clear.

What about the Pu? The Pu is an intergalactic currency divided into

There are eight ningis to a pu, if I recall correctly.

But it doesn't happen immediately. Such an announcement by the Speaker
triggers a Speaker Transition (see R681), and the change of Speaker does
not occur until the Registrar has announced it (R402).

I was thinking of leaving Group votes as they are, to encourage
Legislators to get involved with a Group.

Proto-Proposal
A Separation of Powers

This Proposal has an Adoption Index of 2.

[Comment: the basic framework is surprisingly easy to put in place,
because we already have the concepts of a Voting Entity and a Proposing
Entity defined. They seem, and probably were, made to prepare for this
kind of innovation.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule entitled "Legislators and Voters" be
created with the following text:

      Every Player is either a Legislator or a Voter. By default, every
      Player is a Voter. Newly registered Players are Voters. 

      A Legislator has the right to submit Proposals, but may not cast
      votes on Proposals (i.e., e is a Proposing Entity but not a Voting
      Entity). A Voter has the right to cast votes on Proposals, but not
      to submit Proposals (i.e., e is a Voting Entity but not a
      Proposing Entity).

      A Voter may become a Legislator, or a Legislator a Voter, by
      announcing that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that
      e has not changed from being a Legislator to being a Voter, or
      vice versa, during the previous two months.

      The Registrar shall maintain a record of whether each Player is a
      Legislator or a Voter, and the date and time at which e last
      became either a Legislator or a Voter, and include it in eir
      Registrar's Report.


Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended
by deleting the text:

      Players and Groups are Voting Entities.


Be it further resolved that R766 (Groups) be amended by appending to it
a new paragraph which reads:

      Each Group is a Voting Entity.


Be it further resolved that R1605 (Proposing Entities) be amended by
replacing the text:

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

with the text:

      A Player or other entity is a Proposing Entity only if defined to
      be so by the Rules.


Be it further resolved that R879 (Quorum) be amended by replacing the
phrase "Active Players" with the phrase "Active Voters".


Be it further resolved that R1865 (A Duty to Propose) be repealed.

I disagree. I don't think that this is the kind of case which R1575 was
supposed to cover, which is why it's difficult to decide how to apply
it. R1575 would more clearly apply to cases in which for some reason the
Rules were not what we thought they were (cf. the Pragmatic Currencies
crisis). I tend to doubt that simple ignorance of the Rules can
constitute a defence of "reasonable belief".

My take on this is that Andre is likely guilty of Misappropriation, but
that I'm highly disinclined to report him for it.

I'm with you, Scott. But if your proto 'Standards of Proof' is intended
to improve matters, I'm not sure it succeeds.

That is correct.

"Any people you may meet from time to time are clearly the products of a
deranged imagination."

(I think Agora provides good evidence for the truth of this assertion.)

And, by the way, a pu is a triangular rubber coin *6,800* miles to one
side. From this it follows that the Galactibank is also the product of a
deranged imagination.

I don't think this would have altered the debate about whether Andre is
guilty of Misappropriation had it been in force last week. But perhaps
that's not why you're protoing it.

This is a subtle, but possibly profound, change in our definitions. At
present we reserve the word "Proposal" for a collection of text with
official significance as a Proposal, ie something that the Promotor is
required to put in the Queue, etc. This will make a file sitting on my
local machine, clearly marked as a Proposal, which no-one else has ever
seen, a Proposal. Indded, it may make millions of such files all over
the world at any instant, which have nothing to with Agora, all
Proposals.

I don't believe that the difficulty in applying the Rule arises from any
ambiguity. I think it arises from trying to decide what "reasonable
belief" is. To be more precise, the difficult lies in determining what
your beliefs (reasonable or not), actually were. This is always
problematic in cases like this, if simple cognitive error.

Consider the case of someone, usually competent with numbers, who makes
a simple mistake in arithmetic: "5 + 7 = 13, right?". It's hard to say
what such a person really believes. Probably we can do no better than to
say that, for a brief moment, that person believed contradictory things.

Likewise yourself. You admit that you believe that transferring a VT to
me would be a Crime. Yet you also say that when you actually transferred
a VT to me, you believed that doing do was not a Crime. I think the best
we can say here is that for a brief moment, you believed contradictory
things.

However, belief in contradictions is not reasonable, which is why
reasonable people correct themselves when they catch themsleves doing
it. Ultimately, that is why I believe that you are technically guilty of
Misappropriation.

Okay, okay, but it is the ningi that is 6800 miles on a side. No one

It took me a while to find an example, but there is one (but only one, I
think): according to R1785, The Accountor's Salary "is 1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary." All other Officer Salaries are specified as
weekly Salaries.

The BOS is equal to a number of VTs, currently 1.0, so R1785 effectively
says that the Accountor's Salary is 1.5 VTs. If anything counts as the
Accountor's "designated Salary", in the sense of R1007, this must be it,
so I would say that the Accountor is currently earning 1.5 VTs per
month, while the other Officers eanr similar amounts every week. The
Registrar should tkae note.

The Registrar should also note that Unemployment Benefits are not
specified as being paid weekly, and that the unemployed should therefore
receive only 0.5 VTs at the beginning of February.

All in all, the Salary system is in a complete mess.

Could we go back to weekly payments for everyone please? I've heard
nothing from Crito to suggest that he can't cope with tracking weekly
POs for Salaries.

Indeed.  So?  Have you looked at the definition of a CFJ lately?  Not
much different.

Would you prefer "Agora Nomic hereby adopts Articles 1 through 5 of
the Model Penal Code (1985 Draft) by reference."?

Well, at least in part I'm doing it to get rid of the stupid double
insertion.  However, I do think the language I propose is at least
less unclear than the current language; for the defense to apply you
would have to say that Andre reasonably believed that the
circumstances were such that he was legally permitted to execute a
Transfer Order from the Bank.

True, I don't propose to answer the question as to whether a mistake of
law is reasonable belief.  I'm more than happy to let the judiciary
sort that out.

Yes, but that was, in my thinking, an unusual case, because I was working
against an uncooperative Chancellor, so I had other concerns which overrode
those discussed above. (And, of course, at the time there was no Duty to
Vote.)

Or you could limit the number of Proposals made.  Or else limit the
expenditure of P-Notes to change priorities to those who can propose
in the first place.

To those of you suggesting various versions of this division of labor
concept, I would suggest that if the number of Proposals which can
be proposed is not somehow limited, then the thing that is of value
is the ability to get Proposals distributed, not the ability to
Propose Proposals.

ProtoProposal Chuck121.2
Power to the Rulekeepor

Rule 947 is amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 1 P-Note
      to the Proposal's Proposer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comment on v.2: people seemed to think that v.1 gave the Rulekeepor
too much power.  This limits it by making the Rulekeepor's decision
not to give a P-Note award overturnable without 3 objections.  Also
I deleted the style-like VT award.

Question 1: should the Rulekeepor's decision to give a P-Note award
also be overturnable?

Question 2: does "reversing the Rulekeepor's decision" constitute
a change to a Nomic Poperty, as required by R1728?
