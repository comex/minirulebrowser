Proto-Proposal
Correcting errors in random selections

[Comment: perhaps it's time we laid down some formal guidelines for this
situation.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Correcting errors in random
selections", be created with the following text:

      In the case where it is discovered that in making a random
      selection from amongst several possible outcomes, some of the
      outcomes (call them the 'unfairly treated outcomes') were assigned
      by the selection process probabilities other than those which
      according to the Rules they should have been assigned, then the
      person responsible for correcting the error shall redo the
      selection, assigning to each of the unfairly treated outcomes the
      appropriate probability as defined by the Rules, and assigning to
      the original result of the selection process whatever probability
      remains. The outcome chosen by this process is then taken to be
      the outcome randomly selected.

This only produces the desired result if the unfairly treated
outcomes had probability 0 in the initial selection.

Proto-Proposal
A Duty to Vote

[Comment: effectively, compulsory voting for those can afford it - a real
'use it or lose it' scheme. This ought to increase the size of the
economy, and enable the BOS to be lifted, which I think we'd all like to
see, if it were consistent with maintaining balance. Perhaps this proto
will be controversial; I hope it will be supported. I would be prepared
to add a sunset clause to make this a trial, if enough people thought
that was a good idea.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      A Player's net assets of a Currency are defined to be the amount
      of that Currency possessed by that Player, less the total of the
      undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming that Player as
      payor.

      A Player whose net assets of Voting Tokens at the time a batch of
      Proposals is distributed are greater than three VTs, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, and who fails to cast a
      vote on any Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of
      Failing to Vote, to be detected and reported by the Assessor. The
      penalty for commission of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

Yes, I see that you're right. In the initial draft of the Rule I had
separated out those cases to be treated differently, but then I thought
I could make things simpler, as above. But apparently not. 

Actually, thinking about it more, it's worse than that. The method
proposed doesn't work the way we intuitively want it to (ie it doesn't
capture what I've been calling the 'standard method') even in cases
where the unfairly treated outcomes had probability zero in the initial
selection. Say the possible outcomes are A, B, C, D and E, with E being
unfairly treated and assigned probability zero. Using the initial
selection process, selecting from among A, B, C and D, C is selected.
The standard method will prescribe a new selection, with C assigned a
probability 4/5 and E 1/5. But according to the method described above,
all of A, B, C, D and E count as unfairly treated outcomes, since all of
them were assigned by the initial selection process probabilities other
than those which according to the Rules they should have been assigned:
1/4 for A, B C and D, and 0 for E. So the method proposed will in effect
require a new selection as if the initial selection had never taken
place, which is not what we want, since we want to minimize (while being
fair) the chance of having to actually change the outcome of the result.

Clearly, the proto has to be rethought from scratch.

[v1.1: added an activity test, and changed the On Hold Rule to prevent
Players from being On Hold for less than week. This change is long
overdue, in my opinion, and should help to eliminate all sorts of
opportunities for abuse of the On Hold system that are springing up
between the cracks of the order system.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      A Player's net assets of a Currency are defined to be the amount
      of that Currency possessed by that Player, less the total of the
      undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming that Player as
      payor.

      An Active Player whose net assets of Voting Tokens at the time a
      batch of Proposals is distributed are greater than three VTs, who
      is not denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is still Active
      at the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose
      Voting Period finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any
      Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote,
      to be detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for
      commission of this Infraction is 1 Blot and 1 VT.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

Proto-Proposal
Correcting errors in random selections

[Comment: perhaps it's time we laid down some formal guidelines for this
situation.]

[v2: the most common  - perhaps, in practice, the only - kind of mistake
that occurs is that of having what I call 'excluded outcomes', and these
are treated in the first paragrpah, which, I hope, captures what I have
been calling the standard method. In the cases in which outcomes are not
excluded, but probability is incorrectly distributed amongst the
outcomes, I can't see a simple and straightforward way to correct the
error so as to minimize the chance of having to change the result of the
selection process - the guiding principle behind all of these efforts.
Doubtless there is some way, but it would be very complex to describe.
So in those cases, I've gone for just redoing the selection from
scratch. It's worth stressing that such cases will be rare at worst, and
may never arise at all.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Correcting errors in random
selections", be created with the following text:

      In the case where it is discovered that in making a random
      selection from amongst several possible outcomes, some outcomes
      (call them the 'excluded outcomes') were incorrectly assigned a
      probability of zero by the selection process, then the person
      responsible for correcting the error shall redo the selection,
      assigning to each of the excluded outcomes the probability it
      should have been assigned by the initial selection process, as
      defined by the Rules, and assigning to the result of the initial
      selection process whatever probability remains. The outcome chosen
      by this process is then taken to be the outcome randomly selected.

      In the case where it is discovered that, although there were no
      excluded outcomes, some of the outcomes were assigned by the
      initial selection process probabilities other those which
      according to the Rules they should have been assigned, then the
      person responsible for correcting the error shall completely redo
      the selection process as if the initial selection had not
      occurred, assigning to each of the possible outcomes whatever
      probability the Rules say it should have.

Tricky.  First, we can focus on unfairly treated outcomes (UTOs) given too
low
a probability in the initial selection.  Let's consider the simplest case, a
single UTO:

Actual P(X) = A     P(!X) = 1-A
Proper P(X) = B     P(!X) = 1-B

Probability of changing the first outcome (whether X or !X) to X
  = 1 - [ (1-A) / (1-B) ]
  = (A-B) / (1-B)

Now how can this be extended to multiple UTOs?

Yeah, but of course in the case of CFJ 1101, I haven't performed any
reselections (nor do I intend to), so I don't understand what you're
criticising.

I disagree.  The fact that the roll of the dice came before the
insertion of Macross into the list doesn't alter the fact that he had
as much chance of being selected, precisely because he was always
going to be inserted into the list in the same place.  (The list has
always been sorted alphabetically.)  He would have been selected if
the initial roll had been a six. What's the chance of that being
rolled on a 12-sided die?  Seems like 1 in 12 to me. 

Michael.

Yeah, and I'll get back to this, because this is the same criticism as

I think you're muddled here.  Don't ask yourself what is the
probability of Macross being inserted at position five (which is
zero), ask rather what the probability is of the original roll having
been six.  That number is 1/12, and thus the selection is fair.  

Pretend the selection lists are two pieces of paper, each with 12
names on them.  You provide one of them, and I roll the dice.  I roll
a five, and say, "Kolja is to judge."  But then you say, "Oops, wrong
list," and give me a fresh list.  The fresh list was determined in
advance, the roll was not.  It is clearly fair to take name #5 from
the new list.

I claim that I could quite easily redo all of the selections for the
CFJs called while I was CotC.  Given, how recent they were, the Swann
Order Coup CFJs would be particularly easy.  Those CFJs at least, are
not practically non-retractable in themselves.  Of coure, calculating
different consequences if they are Judged differently might be a pain.

However, I don't see any value in appointing fresh Judges.  I intend
to stick with what we've got and I further believe that R1575 will
preclude anyone successfully calling a CFJ to the effect that I
violated a rule.

Michael.

I don't think there's much point to this.  Why be so nit-pickingly
precise about what has to be done?  (Particularly as it will be so
hard to get it right?) If the person making the (re-)selection does it
fairly, then where's the problem?  A much more pressing task would
surely be to pragmatise the selections so that we didn't have to
debate these issues so often.

It seems to me that we should "pragmatise" selection of Judges, so that
a judge, once selected, remains selected even if at a later date we 
discover that e was selected improperly.

Here's a suggestion:

Right now, we have greatly increased activity in barter (up to 
several transactions a week). This could increase even more, but 
nobody knows the relative value of the various commodities. These 
values are established by trade, but the low number of trades and the 
difficulty of keeping track of prices keeps standard values from 
being established. My suggestion is to create a new discussion list, 
agora-finance, for discussion of trades, auctions, and so on. This 
would (hopefully) encourage people to keep track of the market, and 
submit their own offers. By seperating this activity from discussion 
of proposals, rules questions, and so on, we would give it a status 
as a major part of Agora.

So, does this sound reasonable? Why will/won't it work? Is it too 
hard to implement? Too confusing for new players? Redundant and 
unneccessary? Please, give some feedback!

Yuck. I would love to see this F/Q.

BTW: Proposers, I would recommend waiting a day or three before 
paying the one P-Note on a new proposal, to allow people to point out 
any really obvious mistakes.

Uhm. I, uh, like this, but not quite 1 VT worth. I will vote for it

That's too easy for the CotC to abuse. E can just announce any Judge e

I have no intention of making such a CFJ, but I think you're quite
wrong about R1575. That Rule provides defenses against Crimes. But
violating a Rule is not a Crime. If I were to make CFJ alleging that
"Michael violated R1079" or some such thing, R1575 would provide you
with no defense at all.

My machine thinks it's hostname is

gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au.


Oh - sometime next month (not sure when yet), gecko will be
changing IP #s which will mean it'll be hard to access for a couple
of days while the DNS entry changes propogate.

Any theories about how the extra '.' got in there?

Can you give us a few days warning before it happens?

My own feeling is that such a list would have insufficient volume to
justify its existence on those grounds, and would do little to
establish stable trading values between commodities. In fact, I'm not
even sure that we should expect there to be stable trading values.
At the moment I don't think there's any such thing as "the value of
an Indulgence" tout court. Rather, there's "the value of an Indulgence
to a particular Player at a particular time."
