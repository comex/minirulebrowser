There are fewer Offices than Players.  The only other inputs apart
from Official salaries are Birthday bonuses (once a year), a bonus for
rebelling successfully (a gamble if ever there was one), rewards for
successful proposals and judicial salaries.  Even if we assume that
CFJs come around twice a week, this latter represents a weekly salary
of 2/15 VTs for Players.  A new Player arriving in Agora currently
gets 5 votes and is then stuck.  Say they vote on a reasonable number
of proposals in their first two weeks.  Then what do they do except
give up feeling that they are completely powerless?  (Well, perhaps
they can sell their initial P-Notes, or perhaps use them to make
successful Proposals, a difficult business for a novice, but a
lucrative one; I may be overstating the economic difficulties a novice
faces.)

While I agree that Officers should be rewarded for their contribution
to the game, I do want the sytem to reward other Players.  Would you
vote for the reinstatement of unemployment benefit, or is this also
too unbalancing?

Under Plots, I would also press for the Chancellor or Cartographor to
be given the ability to determine yield rates for the various
Plot-investments.  This should better allow for the pursuit of a
balanced economy.

Sure, I'm in favour of a balanced economy, but I also want to play
with the new ideas inherent in Plots.

I also suggest that our biggest priority at the moment should be to
fix the bugs in the Order rules.  One can currently vacate old TOs
without penalty.  Morendil has exploited the bug already.  Crito would
have fits if I attempted something like vacating all the TOs ever made
by the Bank.  Arbitrary Vacation of Transfer Orders should not be
allowed.

Although it is tempting to count the repeal of R1788 as a step toward
balancing the economy, I cannot but agree with you that the situation
for non-Officers is now unsatisfactory. I insisted that Murphy include
the repeal provision in Plots because I anticipated unemployment benefits
being replaced (more than replaced) by VTs generated by Plots. Of course,
I didn't anticipate Plots being passed in a crippled form. The right way
to go, I think, is probably to reinstate R1788 and let the Chancellor
take this extra income into account when making decisions about the
level of the BOS. Assuming that we do reinstate R1788, and do not adopt
Plots, I'd be pressing for the BOS to be set at about 0.5 VTs.

That idea had also occurred to me, and I think it's a good one. Personally,
I think the power should be vested in the Cartographor - spread the power
around, I say, and make as many of the Offices as possible attractive, and
distinctively interesting. But it means more tinkering with Plots before I'd
be prepared to support it.

>Sure, I'm in favour of a balanced economy, but I also want to play
>with the new ideas inherent in Plots.

The idea I find most interesting in Plots is its exploration of the idea
of specialization as a motive for trade. Naturally, in order to achieve
this, it uses rather artificial means to induce Players to specialize.
I suppose this was unavoidable, though. With the rather small number of
Players and limited number of goods we have here in Agora, specialization
seems unlikely to develop naturally. (_Settlers of Catan_ explores
similar territory in a creative way. I recommend it.)

It is true that representative democracy raises interesting questions
which we haven't really had to deal with here in Agora. But there's a
good reason for that: we don't have nearly enough Players to make a
representative democracy necessary. I don't need a representative in
Agora; looking after my own interests constitutes a fair amount of my
the activity in the game. You can't graft a representative democracy
onto Agora by brute force. It has to arise naturally, if it's going
to arise at all. So I'm not so impressed as you by The Ombudsman. Some
of the toys tacked on at the end might make the position interesting,
but only incidentally to its central motivation, and that motivation
I find lacking in substance.

I think you mean "nor be the Speaker".  As it reads, the Speaker can be the

This will upset the "Hot Blot" mechanism temporarily, but since that is now
self-correcting (to some extent) I don't see this as a show-stopper.

Same here, if the Ombudsman pays out an Indulgence.  It would be more
controversial and subject the Ombudsman to possible negative political
feedback, but it might be interesting in i) and iii) to allow the Ombudsman, in
the case of Indulgences, to issue Payment Orders from one Player to another
rather than let em vacate Blots or pay out from the Bank.

Interesting idea, with I lot of potential, I think.

No Blots, no Indulgences, thank you.

I would suggest reducing Blot penalties instead.  Or maybe waiving
Indulgence Debt during the Grace Period.
