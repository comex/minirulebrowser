This is a thing that made me wonder:

:Of course. That's how I would have done it. I would have sent it to one of
:the backup lists as well, to try to avoid the "BUS:" prefix on the Subject
:header.


If some 'real' spam had been sent to a-b, wouldn't it have received the
BUS:-prefix?
And, why didn't you stop and wonder when you got a message through a-b
_without_ the BUS:-prefix?

The reason, for those looking on, is that R106, which is a Power = 3
Rule, states: 

Rule 106/1 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall be
      voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it
      receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.

Note in particular the necessary and sufficient condition in the second
sentence. Voting on Proposals is deeply entrenched in the Rules, and is
not lightly to be stepped around.

Even if the mechanism were not scammable (and we knew this with
certainty, which would be unlikely), I'd still be against any SA
mechanism operating at Power=3. Scams are not the only problem. There
might be other undesirable consequences which we would not want
entrenched at Power=3, where they would be near-impossible to fix.

Erm, as much as it pains me to point this out: am I not guilty of
Failure to Vote?

H. Herald Crito,

I think that the net result of this week's transfers is that Blob loses
one Kudo and Peekee gains one.

Good point.  I had been thinking that the doubt over his repeal of SA
proposal extended to the adoption of SP as well.  However, this is not
the case as the whole "clear indication" bit is just about what must
be attached to a Proposal, not to an announcement of intention to
adopt without objection.

Real spam cannot easily be sent to the Agora lists, as they only accept
messages from subscribers.  (Although a few spammers have attempted to
actually subscribe to mailing lists before spamming them.)

I guess that as soon as I saw it was spam, I didn't bother checking
further what route it had taken.  I simply didn't notice the To: header.
Also, although it was not used in this case, it would be no problem
sending the mail as a Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc:) such that the To: header
would be empty or something like "Undisclosed Recipients : ;".  This is a
completely legitimate mail format, and is common enough in spam messages.
In that case only a careful check of the route taken would reveal that the
message had passed through an Agora list.

By the way your mailer (Microsoft Outlook Express) has a bug, it
nationalizes the "Re:" in your replies to "Sv:".  I think I saw a fix
somewhere, I cannot remember where.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Fair enough.  I would Vote FOR at this point, but I seem to have missed
the end of the Voting Period.  And it got Adopted anyway.

Perhaps you could require the person conducting the Election to re-post the
effective Protobudget for each Candidate, between the end of Nominations and
the beginning of Voting.

In my case:
1. The message was caught by my spam-filter, so it was stored in a separate
   folder, which I do not normally check
2. To see the difference between spam that is sent through a-b without the
   BUS:, I would need to check its headers. Which for spam I normally only
   do to change my spam-filter and/or to make a complaint. Often I do neither.

Actually, I suggested allowing Proposals to be declared trivial without
objection.  Since most seem to think that SA was a good mechanism for minor
rule changes I thought this would reflect that intent well.  Your mechanism
does accomplish pretty much the same thing so in the end it doesn't matter
much the term that is used.

Hmmm...  the body of this message seems to have disappeared.  I believe it
should have been the following:

The Proposal was presented with an indication that it was meant to be a
Proposal but can that indication be considered clear in light of the fact
that it was obscured by a large volume of unrelated material?  I would say
no.  In fact Steve used this technique precisely because it would be UNCLEAR
that he had submitted a Proposal until he pointed it out.

I do not find this interpretation unreasonable.  However, it fails to make the
distinction between a "clear indication" and an indication which is clearly
perceived - a "platonic" distinction that I would have thought Macross, of
all people, would appreciate.  8)   Yes, if you take the view that clarity is
a function of Players' actual perception and not just of the words themselves,
Macross is correct.  What I am waiting to hear is a convincing argument that
the wording of the SA Rule supports one interpretation over the other.

At this point, I see nothing in the wording of the Rule that brings Player
perception into it, directly.  Must a Player actually see the words "This is
intended to be a proposal" to make that a clear indication?  Sounds
like a "tree falling in the forest" argument.  8)  If someone had spotted
those words in Steve's post and pointed them out, would we still be
having this argument or would we all be assuming that Steve actually
submitted the Proposal?
