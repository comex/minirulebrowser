Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.

Protoproposal Chaos74 [rev. 3]

Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
            performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

> Would someone send me the Ordinances and Will?  I'm curious.

Here are the Regulations.  See 9 and 10 regarding the Will.


1.  The name of this Contest is "Chuck's Second Savings and Loan
    Contest".

2.  The Contestmaster is Chuck.  The Contestmaster shall not
    change.

3.  Changes to these Regulations may be made by unanimous consent of
    the Contestmaster and all Contestants.  However, such changes
    must be announced in the Public Forum to be effective, and
    only take effect 14 days after such changes are announced.
    These Regulations shall not be changed except as described
    here.

4.  When an entity transfers an amount of Currency to this
    Contest, the Contestmaster shall transfer the same amount
    of that Currency back to the entity as soon as possible
    after seven days have passed from the initial transfer,
    subject to the exceptions below.

5.  If this Contest is subject to a Tax on a given Currency,
    the amount to be distributed to entities which had transferred
    that Currency to this Contest, but had not yet been paid
    back, at the time at which the Tax was imposed, shall be
    reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage of the
    tax.  This regulation alters only the amount of Currency
    paid, not the timing.

6.  If an entity which had transferred Currency to this Contest
    ceases to exist before the Currency is transferred back, the
    Currency shall be transferred to the Bank instead.  This
    regulation alters only the recipient of the Currency, not
    the timing.

7.  If the entity transferring Currency to the Contest specifies,
    to the Contestmaster, a different amount of time than the
    seven days specified in Regulation 4, than the Currency
    shall be paid back to that entity as soon as possible after
    the specified length of time has passed after the initial
    transfer.  However, to be effective, such specification of
    time must take place no later than the transfer of Currency.

8.  Currency may not be disbursed from this Contest except as
    required by these Regulations or by the Rules.

9.  Should Chuck's Second Savings and Loan Contest be dissolved,
    the Currencies belonging to it shall be distributed to those
    entities to which they would eventually be paid as per the
    Contest's Regulations, with the exception that those which
    would be distributed to the Player who was Contestmaster
    immediately prior to the dissolution are transferred to
    the Bank instead.

10. As soon as possible after the creation of this Contest,
    the Contestmaster shall take those actions necessary to
    create a Will for this Contest, with the text of Regulation
    9 as the Will's text.  Once created, the Will shall not
    be changed.

Assuming the Will has been executed as required, I would conclude
that, as a matter of law, a participant in Chuck's scheme does not
have effective control of Currencies held by the contest described by
the Regulations Chuck has crafted.
