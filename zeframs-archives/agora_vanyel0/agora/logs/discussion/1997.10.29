This is pretty rough on Kolja. Because *you* took 5 days to announce
his Election by Acclamation - a whole day longer than General Chaos
took to announce your Election as Registrar, which earned him a totally
unmerited blast from you - he had no way of knowing that he even had
a duty to Report, and so cops an FtR.

I think I'll give you a couple of days to find some VTs and Indulgences
to send Kolja's way. Then the Kudos start flowing.

Whoo! Too late, I see. Zefram has left In A Huff. Now, Kolja, you see
what I mean, eh? A shame, but then it always is. I hope he will be back
one day.

True.  I had intended to announce it in a timely manner, but I stopped
spending free time on Agora after the proto fiasco.  Much the same
applies to you as Notary -- I had originally intended to remind you of
your upcoming duty, having a window of only a few hours before the end of
the week.  I'm sorry I caused these inadvertant Infractions.  But I think
with the upcoming Blot amnesty it fortunately won't be a serious problem.

Indulgences are pretty hard to come by.

I figured I'd cop an FtR when I became Notary. Short of logging in during
those few hours, there was little I could do to avoid it. I at least knew
in advance it was coming.

I'm sorry you regard our exchanges on R1042 as a fiasco. I found them
quite productive, as the acknowledgement of co-Authorship is intended to
indicate. It seemed to me that we agreed on so much of the essential
substance of the amendments we wanted to make, yet disagreed on
niggling little details that I mistakenly surmised you would not be
prepared to compromise on, that I thought it would be better if I
just proposed a version I was happy with, rather than trying to convince
you to see things my way on those niggling little details. Since the
result is, I think, a good Proposal, I can't regard the outcome as a
fiasco.

That was a deregistration message in a very traditional style. Well 
pulled off, Zefram. I've been writing drafts of my 'off-in-a-huff' 
parting shot to Agora for months now, possibly the reason why I'm 
still playing is that I can't get it right. :)

I think we should award a special Patent Title to ex-Players and
Players who have at one time or another Left In A Huff. Wes, Kelly,
Swann, and now Zefram are all deserving recipients. Who did I miss?

I wonder if *I'll* ever Leave In A Huff? It seems doubtful; I seem
to have developed a sort of philosophical detachment...

I'm not offended, I'm afraid, just a little saddened. There's much food
for thought in this deregistration message, but for the moment I'd just
like to comment on one part of the message which I thought was
unfair, namely the part having to do with me.

On the contrary: you have already made valuable suggestions which I
incorporated, with acknowledgement, into my Proposal. You remember
that my first reaction to your proto was a rather churlish claim of
priority. I disowned that reaction when I realized that, while there
were points of disagreement, in some respects your proto was clearly
superior to mine. It is simply not true that I refused to compromise
or enter into negotiations.

I must say that it never occurred to me that I should disown the
Proposal. There's nothing wrong with it, after all. You might have
convinced me to do so anyway if you had demonstrated convincingly -
by, say, posting it to the PF -  that you had a new proto that was
substantially different and superior to P3578. But even if you had
done that, I think I would still have supported my Proposal, because
I wanted R1042, which was clearly not working (a fact which, since
you wrote the current R1042, might cause you a moment's reflection on
your gifts for simplicity and elegance) to be fixed as soon as
possible.  Of course, I would then have supported your superior proto
as a further amendment after that. But the point is moot, since you
have never posted this alleged demonstrably superior and
substantially different proto to the PF so we can judge for
ourselves. Naturally, P3578 is gaining support in the absence of any
alternatives.

At any rate, I still think your first theory is the best one: your
contributions are valued, although of course only you can say if
they are valued to an extent great enough to satisfy you and in
proportion to what you feel to be their worth. I think if you look
back over my record of support for and opposition to your Proposals,
you will find that it is healthily mixed. I think the record will show
that I've judged your Proposals on what I took to be their merits.
I suppose at this point I should come clean and own up that I even
supported the current version of R1042 - so the blame for its current
state does not rest with you, or at least not with you alone. But that's
true of every Proposal: the Authors only write them. The voters adopt
them, and get what they deserve in consequence.

Indeed.  One can't afford to take games too seriously after all.
Nonetheless I can understand the way in which they can seem to become
important enough to warrant Huff-leaving.  Also I suppose it's
possible to imagine a situation wherein things became so hateful that
one felt forced to leave.  I hope this doesn't happen in Agora, though
Zefram did say that he felt people were bearing a grudge against him..

I think giving people Patent Titles is a good idea.

One unfamiliar with Agora might suppose that in such a large system,
growing so fast, there would be many Rules that do not function
properly, and that we'd spend all our time trying to fix what we have.
Yet amazingly we do not preoccupy ourselves with bugfixing, and find
time to add yet more complexity.  
[snip]
We have a much simpler solution: we ignore the problem.
<<

I tend to agree with this. This is also why I jumped at the chance to
shorten the ruleset somewhat with my abolish-P-notes-proto.

Especially during the recent VT destruction crisis I was getting a bit
nervous because the problem was addressed and solved so slowly (it's
not fully solved yet!). But I don't think this is only due to an
intentional unwillingness to solve problems: it also has to do with
the fact that we are playing this game as a spare time activity, and
many don't seem to be so eager to solve all problems as quickly,
efficiently and rigorously as real life problems simply because they
aren't RL problems, so they don't really hurt anyone (in general -
zefram was hurt, after all...). And this relaxed, playful attitude is
something I consider a good thing. In addition, spending all the time
with fixing old bugs instead of discussing new, higflying concepts is
a bit dreary and a lot like the everyday programming work many of us
are doing daily anyway, so it lacks the appeal a game should have (at
least to me). 

>>
The only viable theory that remains is that some Agorans bear a personal
grudge against me; I can see no other explanation for the recent events.
<<

I don't really want to defend myself from this accusation or try to
coax zefram back into playing. But as an interesting observation of
what can happen in games about politics and democracy (just like in RL
politics and democracy) I'd like to say two things about this,
anyway. 

One is that on a general level I don't feel I have played long enough
to develope pronounced likes or dislikes for particular players. I'm
beginning to develope some, but very slowly. And: I don't always let
them guide me in my decisions. In fact, this is one thing I like about
a democracy _game_ rather than RL democracy: that shifting alliances
are more easy to realize, and that I can (or at least hope I can)
cooperate with people in some points and yet oppose them or be annoyed
about eir behaviour in other respects.

Concerning the Absence proto affair, again zefram's interpretation
doesn't quite cover my case: I did vote for Steve's proposal because
it was ok for me. I ignored zefram's call for nonvotes because Steve
protoed something about absence first so I felt it was perfectly ok
for him to go ahead and propose it - zefram didn't have priority and
no right to demand that Steve's proposal be ignored. OTOH, had zefram
then proposed an even better version, I wouldn't have hesitated to
vote for that, too, and I wouldn't have seen my vote for Steve's
proposal as wasted (VTs aren't _that_ scarce, after all).

Enough of this now, this is meant more for the record or for those of
you who like to analyse voting patterns and the way opinions are
formed (one of the aspects I like about Nomic), not so much as a
personal reply to zefram or a refutation of what e wrote..

Kolja A.


P.S. Dear zefram, 

please excuse me for CCing this to you personally - I just wasn't sure
whether you are still subscribing to agora-discussion.

Not anymore.  Proposal 3564 amended Rule 1445 to eliminate this
problem.  You might even consider CFJing the appropriateness of the
penalty imposed, on the basis of that amendment.

This illuminates a minor sticky point.  Zefram has deregistered and
thus cannot vacate the aforementioned orders.  I believe the only
avenue for redress is a CFJ, which would then (if judged favorably)
allow the Judge to vacate the Orders in question.

I do not believe that you have the authority to vacate these Orders,
although I will consider arguments to the contrary.

Rule 1734/0 (Power=1)
Vacated Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is vacated when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts to the Public Forum a
      notice to the effect that a given Payment Order is being
      vacated.  This notice must clearly identify the Payment Order
      being vacated.

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency in that Payment Order shall execute a new Payment
      Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with the payor
      and payee interchanged.

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that
      Order.

I was in such a Huff that I was speecheless (typeless). I didn't even use the

Why the sudden urgency to fix this harmless bug, when much more serious
problems (such as the old Index definition loophole, or PttP's still
extant lack of protection against arbitrary changes of Power) go unfixed
for months?

Somehow I rather suspect that any further attempted refinement would
have been rejected by the electorate as unnecessary.  Of course, that's
just me being cynical.

Why don't you start a new nomic and play in the way you prefer? I
might be willing to join and try to play along. If you want to make
sure that such a new nomic is not Agora-ized soon, you might make it
an Imperial style nomic, at least to begin with and until such a

I'm not convinced.  I recall favor transferring it to someone else.
Where it went now is going to be tricky to determine -- it's probably
indeterminate -- but I suspect that it is more likely to exist than not.

What makes him ineligible to possess Currency?  Being dead?  Are you
saying that the fyshbowl is alive?  And what would happen if a human
died while in possession of Currency -- would it magically disappear in
a completely unpragmatic manner?

A British politician (of the Monster Raving Loony Party) and former

and usually loses his deposit, but a couple of years ago the MRLP did

1.3 VTs is just as much an entity as 1 P-Note, as Currencies are described

The Rules impose an obligation, and if I hadn't reported it then a CFJ

It imposes a requirement on the Office as a whle, not any individual
holder.  However, it imposes the penalty at the end of the week, so it
is the holder at that time that gets the penalty.  Most unfair.

That's not proper Huffishness; you have to let loose with a long 
inflamed diatribe to the PF explaining the reasons for the act in 
some detail. What you describe sounds more like ennui.

IIRC, it would actually only allow the Judge to Injoin the CotC to
vacate them.  What a mess.

Disagreed.  1 P-Note is indivisible; 1.3 VTs is not.  Since 1.3 VTs is
divisible, I consider it to be an agglomeration of its divisible
elements.

Never.  Plato lives on!  He is alive in our hearts and minds.  (Some

What about transfers to:

Still, as a matter of fact, Plato has no tangible existence, nor does
he exist as a matter of law under these Rules or under any other
cognizable body of law that I'm aware of.

Indeed.  I had considered attempting a transfer to a fictional character.
General Chaos seems to be deciding between valid and invalid recipients
in a completely arbitrary manner, Rishonomic style.

So all these US legal cases "the People vs. Joe Bloggs" actually have

I am not being in the least bit arbitrary.  Rather, I am using a very
simple, very obvious decision rule: the recipient must either be a
tangible entity existing as a matter of fact, or must exist as a
matter of law.

Frankly, I grow quite tired of your constant sniping.

I am not aware of an _Agoran_ case involving "The People".  You have
picked on me incessantly for allowing considerations from other legal
systems to creep in to play here, and now you criticize me for not
doing so?

In digression, the prosecution of criminals in the several States is
reflective of the principle that, in a constitutional democracy,
sovereign power arises from "the people".  In English law of the late
18th century, criminal charges were brought in the name of the
sovereign.  The obvious adaption of this custom to American
sensibilities was to bring such charges in the name of "the people",
our replacement for the sovereign.  In English jurisprudence, the
prosecutor presents charges on behalf of the king (or queen); in
American, he does so on behalf of the people.  Since every state in
the US except Louisiana rests its legal customs on some variation on
English common law, criminal charges under state law are generally
prosecuted as "People v. Doe".  (Not all states still use this form;
Indiana, for example, captions criminal cases as "State of Indiana
v. Defendant".)

I should also note that Andrew's statement is not wholly correct.
_US_ legal cases are never brought as "the People v. Joe Bloggs".  In
federal procedure, criminal charges are brought in the name of the
United States; thus, the caption would be "United States v. William
McVey" (to use a recent example).  It is only in _state_ jurisprudence
that the phrase, "The People", is found.  But it is quite common for
non-Americans unfamiliar with America's split system, especially those
from unitary nations such as England, to make this error.

If I wanted that, I'd take a cataloging class.  Oh, wait, I am.

AACR2R (Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, 2nd ed., Revised) (the
standard of cataloging used in most libraries in the English-speaking
world) makes the Agoran Ruleset look like a trifold pamphlet in
comparison.  OK, well, at least it's internally consistent (for
the most part), but its length makes up for that.

Not at all.  I just picked the US legal system as an example of an
instance where the people of the United States are regarded as a single
entity.  I see no reason why collective entities should not be just as
valid recipients of Currency transfers as individual entities.

You deny some of these transfers on good grounds, others on
questionable ones; yet you don't even question the validity of
this transfer?

Rule 1733/0 (Power=1)
Disputed Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is disputed if there is a COE regarding it which
      has not been denied, or a CFJ challenging the legality of its
      execution which is either presently assigned to a Judge or to a
      Board of Appeals for consideration.

      When a a COE regarding a Payment Order is accepted, the order
                                                          ^^^^^^^^^
      shall be vacated (and an new order issued, if appropriate).  The
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Judge of a CFJ which finds that a Payment Order was illegally or
      improperly executed shall make an Injunction requiring the Clerk
      of the Courts to vacate the illegal Payment Order.

The Rules do make it clear that Steve, as Registrar pro-tem, is required to
admit or deny my COE.  Since e has admitted the claim, it seems to me that
R1733 requires Steve to vacate the Orders involved in my COE, unless you read
this as an "automatic" vacation of the Orders by the Rules themselves.  Either
way, those Orders are now vacated.  Do we need a CFJ on this?

I agree with Zefram on this one--at least as far as Currenicies
being a mass quantity, and not a count quantity (am I using those terms
right?)  From Rule 1577:

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Minimum Unit
      Quantity (MUQ).  This quantity is the smallest amount of that
      Currency which is permitted to be transferred.  All transfers
      and holdings of a Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest
      multiple of its MUQ.

Nothing about *requiring* transfers to be multiples of the MUQ.
The fact that transfers and holdings are *rounded* to the nearest
multiple of the MUQ implies that it is possible for them not to
be, at least initially, multiples of the MUQ.

Because Rule 1598 speaks of "entities" and does not exclude
collective enitities.

R1598:

                          An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

It says "entity".  The same language is used everywhere of any relevance.
There is nothing limiting this to individual entities; collective entities
are entities, and as such are valid destinations of TOs.

I don't think a CFJ is needed; I am now satisfied that there is
sufficient statutory authority for Steve to vacate the Orders.

Then "the people of the United States" is also a constituted entity.

There are no Indulgences minted yet. The Debt Rule has been

Honestly, I agree with Zefram that we have more than enough holes in the

It is not dangerous, just boring work - we would have to read carefully
through every large message to the PF to see if it contained a Repeal
Declaration. Rule 754 would make it possible to avoid being found by
simple search patterns.
