I thought you had, too.  Unfortunately I no longer have a copy of the
relevant message, so I'm not certain why your actions failed to rid
Elde of all Currency - or else how e later came to possess Currency
once again.

H. Assessor, H. Herald, how far back do your Currency records for
Elde extend?

My records go back to the adoption of the Pragmatic Currencies
Proposal.  They show that Blob attempted to resolve Elde's probate on
25 November 1997, but missed because of an misapprehension as to the
number of VTs possessed by Elde (ordering 2 VTs transferred to the
Bank, instead of 8).

My NS4.04 preferences are set to wrap long lines at 72 chars. If this is
not happening I'd like to know why and how else I can make it happen.
(I'm not going to sit here counting chars all the time). While we're at
it, I have my outgoing messages set to send in both HTML and TXT, but
can't see what that does at the other end. Does everyone get the message
in their preferred format, or do they get two messages or what ? (I am
only getting one copy back from the a-d, etc. servers) I noticed that
I'm getting two copies of each of your messages, that's why I'm asking.

Sounds good to me. I'm just tossing ideas around. That's what a disc

Sending things to the PF is almost always acceptable as a substitute
for sending things to people directly (see the Insanity Rule for a
possibl exception), as it is a requirement that everyone be subscribed
to the PF.

Probate is a necessary part of a functioning economy.  Take, for
example, the Organizational Payment Orders that are now possible
(because, I note, of a Proposal you yourself authored).  Probate
ensures that the Organization gets what it is entitled to if the Payor
deregisters or is dissolved without having fulfilled that Order.
Under the regime you suggest, the Organization gets screwed in that
case.

My records go back as far as July 21 of last year.  I show all P-Note and
Indulgence debts, credits, and currency holdings as having been properly
eliminated for Elde.

[ This is posted to the business list because I am upholding my plan,
  but elaborating on the reasoning.  This is my way of re-formulating
  the Plan, per 1738.  I do not have to stop posting about this Plan
  until a CFJ is lodged. ]

I would ask you to look again at the rules of Probate (1601, 1637,
1738, 1739, 1757).  I do not believe your objections stand up on
examination.

First of all, I am arguing that, since there seems to be no definition
of "terminal" defined nor any apparent means for making an entity
"terminal", ChrisM cannot be considered so.  Thus the sections of the 
Probate rules relevant to "terminal" entities do not apply.

Now, let us examine the issue of creditors.  Rule 1739 states that the
_first_ action in a Probate plan will pay off the creditors of the
entity.  In this case, ChrisM has, apparantly, none, so we must move
on to the next stipulations.  All of the following text deals with
"terminal" entities, which I am arguing is irrelevant.

Thus, since no Probate rule determines what occurs to "non-terminal"
entities, and nowhere does it state that an entity in Probate must
leave eir currencies _solely_ to creditors, the recipients of eir 
Will and the Bank (except in "terminal" sections) I am opting for a
different path.

I therefore uphold my plan, to commence a week from this post.

So why does your Herald's Report of 19 Jan 98 list Elde's estate as
possessing 1 Indulgence?

I like it.  Lend at your own risk.  But how do Wills fit into this picture?
