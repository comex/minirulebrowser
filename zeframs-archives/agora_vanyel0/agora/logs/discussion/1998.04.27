And how exactly does rule 1738 require me to do that ;o)

Please CC any reply (not that it needs one :o) as I'm un-a-d'd.

Fellow Agorans,

The distributed version of my Electees proposal is fine as is, but it
doesn't address the Speaker-Elect problems raised by Michael and others.
I'm a bit busy this week, but by this weekend, I hope to write up a Proto
dealing with these issues. 

Thanks for your patience, everyone.
