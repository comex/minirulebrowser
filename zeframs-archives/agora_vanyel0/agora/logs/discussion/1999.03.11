For the Speaker to object to their own action would be strange, to
say the least. Unless he wants to be schizophrenic and make
the motion in his capacity as public servant and oppose it as a
private citizen.

Oh, I understand. We he said "they will ... not object", I thought he
was referring to all three players. Another case where the Spivak 
pronoun is superior.

Annotations are useful for another purpose, however, and that is for
directing players to relevant Judgements when trying to decide how a
Rule should be interpreted. I wish that every Judgement that has ever
been delivered and which still has relevance to interpreting some Rule
had an Annotation corresponding to it in the FLR.

Whether we need to have Orders to Annotate, however, is a different
question.

Well, why would the Speaker object to an action initiated by emself?

I was Assessor for a long time, and I doubt I would have appreciated
such a regime. Sorting out Payment Orders for month's voting would be a
nasty and complex task. And while Scott G. is sure to point out around
now that he has a perl script which would make the job pure simplicity,
I still prefer to avoid moves which increase our reliance on automation.

That's one objection. Another is that such a move would break Denial of
Voting Privileges.

Okay, so rather than "adopting" the Proposal, we just put into effect 
all the Rule changes described by the Proposal, and remove the proposal
from the queue.

effective are these so called checks and balances upon which Blob is so
keen to rely...

          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with

putting a proposal in effect this way: 4 days
impeaching the Justiciar and/or CotC: 7 days
removing the Speaker (through tainting): 7 days plus

A Rebellion is not as clear. It might be able to be done immediately, it
might also not be able for a period of one month. And in any case it is
not sure-hit, while the others are, provided enough players agree.

Also note, that a Rebellion will not be a problem for such a conspiracy at
all, provided that either one of the three conspiring players (Speaker,
Justiciar, CotC) is the Registrar or there is a fourth person in who holds
the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Why "plus"?

I can see how the Registrar could be of use, by what use is the S-E?

The Officers are not immediately replaced when the Rebellion succeeds, but
the Speaker possibly is. If the S-E is in the conspiracy, then a succeeded
Rebellion will not cause someone who is not in it to get the power to
object.

Protoproposal Chaos54 [rev. 4]

Zero Payment Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

Yes, but the proposal explicitly stated that the Speaker who posted the
intent to act must still be speaker at the time of acting. So the new
Speaker-Elect would have to go through it all over again from the beginning.

I agree that annotations are useful; what I question is the usefulness 
of Orders to Annotate, given the very limited circumstances in which
one can be issued.

Yes, except this time, free of any worries about Rebellion for another month. 

In any case, if there is ever a Rebellion for some unrelated reason, the
Rebellion-free period immediately after the new regime is installed would
be an extremely tempting time to use this power...

Two. If the Speaker were going to object, why would e have initiated the
action in the first place? Granted, all THREE need to agree, but once it
has been announced, only the Justiciar and the CotC would probably
object.

Blah. Fundamentally it's the same proposal with the same flaws. Sure,
you added a provision that the Speaker must be untainted and the 2
Supporters must actively -agree- as opposed to actively disagreeing, but
this still can be scammed too easily. First proposal I would try to cram
through if I had a chance and wanted to scam it:

Rule 1064 is hereby repealed
Rule 1486 is hereby repealed
Rule 1665 is hereby repealed
Rule 1664 is hereby repealed

Rule 1556 is amended to read:

The Term of Service for an Office shall never expire. This Rule takes
precedence over Rules which specify a different Term of Service.


etc.

Oh, and... um... you ended #2 with a preposition ;)

I apologize, I didn't realize it was ambiguous. For what you were
saying, you are completely correct.

Actually it crashes before the end of the file... so that doesn't work.

So order the Judge below to order the Accountor to vacate the
reversing Order.  (I actually prefer this to ordering the Clerk of the 
Courts.)

This does suggest a lacunae exists, however.

Shoot!  I used to have a similar problem with Groupwise (the old version),
except that it worked fine when I saved the message to disk - it 
refused to display the entire message within the e-mail system, but
once I issued the save command, I could see everything fine with
the text editors.  Sounds like your system is even crappier than
Groupwise.  8)

Okay, well I'm never going to vote for you for Speaker-Elect, now.

You people elect the Speaker, Justiciar and CotC, and yet you have so
little trust in them! You disgust me! :p

Arrgh.  Issue an order forcing the Judge to issue an order forcing
the Accountor to issue an order that will force the Accountor
to issue the penalty, rather than issue an order that will
force the CotC to issue the penalty.  I understand why you
prefer this, but it is rather convoluted.

>This does suggest a lacunae exists, however.

Yes, it is open to abuse by a Board of Appeals.  I was
tempted to include an order for the CotC to order
everyone to brush their teeth.  8)
