Let's see, I attempted to Nominate on     Wed, 10 Dec 1997 05:31:15 -0800
and Nominations began at                  Wed,  3 Dec 1997 11:45:58 +0000
meaning I missed the deadline by not quite 2 hours.  Sigh.

Protoproposal Chaos21 [rev. 1]

Kill the Damn Monster, Already

WHEREAS, it has been amply demonstrated that the Frankenstein Mutator,
while occasionally amusing, has the overall effect of making the Game
consistently unplayable,

and WHEREAS, at least some of the Players of this Nomic prefer to have
some semblance of stability,

and WHEREAS, the confusion and complexities that the Frankenstein
Mutator introduces makes performing the duties of the various Offices
of the Game so tedious and complicated as to not be worth the effort,
thereby threatening to render the Game unplayable through lack of
recordkeeping,

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that the following Rule be created with
Power 1.5 and the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, Rules 1671, 1672, 1673, and 1674
      shall be repealed.  Once this has occured, this Rule shall
      repeal itself.

That is OK, SON, I will try to get rid of that sentence LATER.

I also find your deeming strange, given that we have had a long history of
negative currencies and that Indulgences were strongly based on that
principle before Pragmatic Currencies arrived.

In this case I tend to agree with Scott;  I am of the opinion that
"Illegal X" may mean "Purported but not actual X" and this seems a similar
case.  This has nothing to do with Platonism/Pragmatism per se, just with
language.

I vaguely recall a CFJ on something like this, which way did it go?

This must have been in one of the very early versions of the Rule,
when it was numbered 805 or 907. That would have been before I
arrived.

That's obvious: the Contestants will have to recruit persons who are
not currently Players to become Players and then Contestants!

It would be nice to at least be sure what the Rules were...

I really suspect your latest problem with the Frankenstein Monster is more
a case of our general Endemic Game Uncertainty.

As for killing Platonism, some of us are _always_ going to interpret the
Rules Platonically, no matter what you do.  If you want Pragmatism you
must write Platonical meta-Rules that implement it.

IMO, that tradition was based on peculiar wordings of the Currency

In any case, it's not my concern anymore.  Address your complaints to

I know that.  I'm working on it.  It's actually not that hard, you

I merely note that this is not how things worked with the Powers,
whose distribution provisions were similarly worded. I still think
Crito should use the list as of the time he actually makes the
distributions.

I would not have done so. I think 1742 was the correct number to assign
at the time. The insistence that "Rules later determined to have been
incorrectly enacted" is meaningless seems to me unnecessarily hard-nosed.

I do disagree with this ruling. It seems to me that this case should
be treated analogously with the treatment of Andre's Proposal,
'General Organizations', the numbering of which was the subject of
CFJ 887. I argued there as follows:

      Now we come to my second point. It is my contention that
      Promotor Andre has still not assigned a Number to his Proposal
      "General Organizations" in accordance with Rule 109. In order
      to obey that Rule, he must therefore assign "General
      Organizations" a Number.  Which Number should he assign it?
      Obviously, he should assign it "the least integer greater than
      all other Numbers previously assigned". Since Promotor Andre
      has just distributed a new batch of Proposals Numbered
      2751-2758, the least integer greater than all other Numbers
      previously assigned is 2759. Therefore, "General Organizations"
      should be assigned that Number. Should Promotor Andre assign
      any further Numbers to submitted Proposals before Numbering
      "General Organizations", then, of course, the Number he should
      assign to "General Organizations" will be correspondingly
      altered. Unless and until this happens, however, 2759 remains
      the correct Number for that Proposal.  

In this case, I would argue similarly that you still have not assigned
'A Public Voting Experiment' a Number in accordance with R1349. Your
attempt to assign it the Number 1741 failed because that was not the
least integer greater than any other previously assigned to a Rule.
That Number is currently 1754 (I think), and that is the Number which
'A Public Voting Experiment' should be assigned. Yes, this will play
havoc with P3634, but we'll just have to live with that. Renumbering
the other Rules is not necessary, however.

I'm not sure what to do. I think Scott's method is mistaken, and that
you should use the list of Players at the time you make the distributions.
But I'm not sure I can be bothered dragging you through the Courts to
force you.

I think this is the proper interpretation of the Rules.  The
assignment of the same number to two Rules seems to me to be decidely
undesirable and clearly inappropriate.

Can someone confirm that 1754 is the least unused Rule Number? I've
deleted Chuck's last numbering message. When I have confirmation,
I'll make a CFJ.

  Judged TRUE by elJefe, Sat, 23 Nov 1996 17:04:17 +0000
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The caller's arguments are persuasive:

1.) Rule 109's provisions are not to be read as if they were unrelated
sentences of separate Rules, but as a whole.  In particular, the
Promotor shall give the Proposal a number, and that number shall be
the next unused proposal number.

2.) Since that had not yet happened at the time this CFJ was called,
no number was assigned to the Proposal in question.  His attempts to
assign already-used numbers could be called an instantly retractible
error, or simply not a game move.


Thus, when the CFJ was called, the only number that could be correctly
assigned, (and which was actually assigned shortly thereafter) was the
next unused number, namely 2759.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 109/2 (Semimutable, MI=2)
Proposal Numbers

      The Promotor shall give each submitted Proposal a Number for
      reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall be the least integer
      greater than all other Numbers previously assigned to a Proposal
      (including numbers assigned to Proposals later determined to
      have been incorrectly submitted), or 301, whichever is greater.


======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I rely on a particular reading of Rule 109, which I will explain and
defend. If this reading is correct, the truth of the Statement follows
as a consequence.

Here's Rule 109:

      The Promotor shall give each submitted Proposal a Number for
      reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall be the least integer
      greater than all other Numbers previously assigned to a Proposal
      (including numbers assigned to Proposals later determined to
      have been incorrectly submitted), or 301, whichever is greater.

My interpretation relies on what should be two simple and
uncontroversial points. The first point is that the second of the Rule
is an amplification of the first sentence. That is, the Number
referred to in the second sentence is the same Number as that referred
to in the first sentence as being assigned by the Promotor.  We should
understand the second sentence as instructing the Promotor on how to
choose the Number of a submitted Proposal. To deny this first point is
to claim that Rule 109 gives the Promotor no clue at all as to which
Number it is e is meant to assign to a submitted Proposal - and that
is absurd. So the first point establishes what should already be
obvious, that Rule 109 gives instructions to the Promotor about how to
assign Proposal Numbers.

What instructions does Rule 109 give? We are not here dealing with a
question concerning incorrectly submitted Proposals, so we can ignore
the qualification in parentheses. Nor need we worry about the
comparison with 301. Effectively, then, here's what Rule 109 says
about which Number the Promotor should assign to a Proposal:

      The Number of a Proposal shall be the least integer greater
      than all other Numbers previously assigned to a Proposal...

Now we come to my second point. It is my contention that Promotor
Andre has still not assigned a Number to his Proposal "General
Organizations" in accordance with Rule 109. In order to obey that
Rule, he must therefore assign "General Organizations" a Number.
Which Number should he assign it? Obviously, he should assign it "the
least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
assigned". Since Promotor Andre has just distributed a new batch of
Proposals Numbered 2751-2758, the least integer greater than all other
Numbers previously assigned is 2759. Therefore, "General
Organizations" should be assigned that Number. Should Promotor Andre
assign any further Numbers to submitted Proposals before Numbering
"General Organizations", then, of course, the Number he should assign
to "General Organizations" will be correspondingly altered. Unless and
until this happens, however, 2759 remains the correct Number for that
Proposal.

Relevant Rules: 109, 451.
