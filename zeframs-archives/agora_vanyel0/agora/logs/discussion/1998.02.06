Still, there are some positive reinforcement loops which could be 
interesting to simulate in Nomic. I am particularly fascinated by the
bank confidence paradox.

If a bank is going to lose a lot of money, people will take their money
out to avoid losing it. If a lot of people do this, the bank will collapse.
Thus, the belief that a bank is going to collapse is a self-fulfilling 
one, as long as it gains a certain critical threshhold. It would appear
that this is a positive feedback loop, but with more than one attractor.

I might re-propose my amendment to the Rebellion rules, to see what 
the current Nomic populace think of it. The idea behind them was to
make Rebellion a two-attractor positive feedback problem. 

Basically, the more people involved in a Rebellion, the more likely it
should be to succeed. And it should always profit players to be on the
winning side of a Rebellion. So there are two attractors. 

If no-one is rebelling, then a Rebellion is likely to fail, so players
are encouraged not to rebel.

If everyone is rebelling then a Rebellion is likely to succeed, so players
are encouraged to rebel.

If about half of the players are Rebelling, then we have a rather 
curious situation, where political influences will hold sway. If you 
can convince people the Rebellion is likely to succeed/fail, then you will
increase the chances of your prophecy being true.

I might dig out the old proto and re-post it.

"Amend Me If You Can" should repeal this rule at the same time as it

The Cabal (TINC) informs me that there once was a (not very active) Nomic

     Well, it's not really a reward, it's actually a penalty.  I just

the effect of making it somewhat more difficult for the Proposer to

Not necessarily.  I seem to recall seeing a potential reward for
voting against Proposals that fail.  Depending on the dynamics, this
may make it a net gain for one Player in a coalition to propose
several "Terrible Proposals" so that the others in the coalition can
benefit from voting it down.

I meant that people voting against a failed Proposal receive an award.

This is not unlike the original Terrible Proposals scam on Nomic World,
the MUD-based predecessor to Agora.  In Nomic World, Proposals had
to be seconded to be put up for vote.  If you were asked to second a
Proposal, you had three options: second it, privately refuse to second
it, or publically refuse to second it.  Now, the proposer of a proposal
received an F-A award or penalty.  Players who seconded a passing
proposal, or publically refused to second a failed proposal, received
two poitns each.

A group of about 6 people got together and proposed a series of
terrible proposals, with one person seconding each proposal, and
the rest publically refusing to second it.  Thus, they ended up with
a net gain of points.

Steve posted the text of the TPs not too long ago, and I think I
still have them--I'll repost for the benefit of the new players.

Arrgh!   I had just found it, too, and was so proud of myself
for finding out so quickly when I didn't know it before. :)

Well, Ganelon was a pseudonym used by King Oberon on Roger Zelazny's
"Nine Princes in Amber" books, but I'm not sure if that series
deserves the appelation of "fairly poor".

     Yay! ...I think...
     Actually, I'll probably need as many Indulgences as I can get
after the resolution of the Appeals of my CFJ.

The first novel, _Nine_Princes_Of_Amber_, was excellent, the next two
good, it all went downhill from there.  Thus my assessment of all ten 
books as a whole as "fairly poor".  In fact, I think Roger Zelazny 
could face competition from only Frank Herbert and Piers Anthony for 
the worst series overall in all of speculative fiction...

(I mean, by the end I was longing to return to the 25 book _Gor_
 series...)

I wouldn't be so sure. I mean, certainly both Dune and Xanth get boring
after the first few installments - in my case, two of each were quite enough
-
but they seemed to have been only the start of a trend. Looks like authors
these days think of writing a single novel - i.e. one you can read on its
own
without feeling bullied into buying a whole string of them - quite passé.
I'd
add Julian May to the above list, to mention but one name.
