Protoproposal Chaos22 [rev. 6]

The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
      Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
      penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
      a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
      that e did in fact commit that Crime.

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

      A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
      specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
      to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
      informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
      specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
      the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.

      No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
      the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
      be by Sentencing Order(s).  The Judge of a CFJ, the statement of
      which alleges that an entity has committed a Crime, shall
      execute Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty
      required by the Rules for that Crime, if and only if that CFJ is
      judged TRUE.

      The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
      shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
      executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
      also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
      by the Rules for that Infraction.

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:

      No entity shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
      single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
      Rule notwithstanding.

      Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through
      action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
      there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
      same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
      the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.

      This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
      for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
      inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
      any combination thereof.

[Rule 1505 is not changed.]
      
Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
      time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
      Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
      The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
      first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
      continues for the period specified.
 
      While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
      Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
      Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

      If an Order denying Voting Privilege is stayed during the period
      of denial, the period of denial is extended for the duration of
      such stay, but the Order is without effect.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:

      The Judge of a CFJ, the statement of which alleges that a Player
      has failed to perform a duty required of em by the Rules, shall
      execute an Order requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible, if and only if the CFJ is judged TRUE.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall bind that Office or position.
      If the Player holding that Office fails to perform the duty in
      question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that Player be
      removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

      The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
      so by a Judge according to this Rule constitutes being an
      Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.

      The failure of a Player to perform a duty required of em by
      virtue of being a Judge is not subject to review by the
      procedures established in this Rule.  Any CFJ alleging that a
      Judge has failed to perform a duty of a judicial nature shall be
      dismissed.

      A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
      perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
      filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
      of the Clerk of the Courts, with respect to that CFJ.

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.  An Order may be
      directed to the holder of an Office or other official position
      in eir capacity as that Office or other official position, and
      in this case if the Office or position changes hands before the
      Order is satisfied, the duty to abide by the Order automatically
      attaches to the new holder of that Office or position.  An
      Order, the purpose of which is to affect the operation of a
      prior Order, is as valid as any other Order, even if not
      directed at any particular entity.

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.  A Judicial Order is an Order executed
      by a Player while acting as a Judge.  An Appellate Order is an
      Order executed by a Board of Appeals.  An Administrative Order
      is an Order executed by the holder of an Office or other
      official position (such as the Speaker or the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency) other than that of a Judge or Justice, in the course
      of performing the duties of that Office or position.  A Private
      Order is any other sort of Order.

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  However, in order to be proven valid
      by CFJ, the Rules must permit the Player who executed the Order
      in question to execute such an Order, that the execution of the
      Order must have been required by or permitted in the
      circumstances which existed at the time it was executed, and
      that the Order has not been rendered invalid by the operation of
      any other Rule.  Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or
      hinder its own appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order
      which has this effect is void and without force.

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remediating
      such circumstances when they occur.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Generally, any Order may be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player who executed it; certain classes of Orders may be
      amended, stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when
      the Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.
      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.  Vacating an Order to Amend has the
      same effect as would an Order to Amend which reinstates the
      previous form of the Order.

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
      Order from having any effect.  A stay may be ordered for a fixed
      time, in which case the stay expires at the time specified; or
      for an indefinite time, in which case the stay will not expire.
      If no specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall
      be indefinite.  When the stay expires or is vacated, the
      previously stayed order again has effect as if it had been
      originally executed at the moment the stay ceases to be
      effective.  However, if the stayed Order is vacated while
      stayed, it does not regain effect when the stay expires or is
      lifted.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
      Call for Appeal.  The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a
      Judicial Order is improperly or invalidly executed, order that
      that Order be amended or vacated, as they deem appropriate.
      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
      stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
      the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
      stay.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  The Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as soon as possible
      after receiving it from the Board of Appeal which executed it.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial determination that the certification required by this
      Rule was falsely provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order
      which was accompanied by that false certification.

      The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
      serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
      the Justiciar otherwise.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
      is improperly or invalidly executed.  The Judge of a CFJ, the
      Statement of which alleges that an Administrative or Private
      Order was improperly or invalidly executed, shall vacate that
      Order if and only if the CFJ is judged TRUE.  When the Clerk of
      the Courts receives a properly executed Call for Judgement, the
      statement of which alleges that an Administrative or Private
      Order was improperly or invalidly executed, the Clerk of the
      Courts shall stay the Order in dispute.  If the Judge affirms
      the validity of the original Order, e shall then vacate this
      stay.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
own right.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
those procedures.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
      shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.

[Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
Rule 1598, above.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and does not take
      effect until the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied or has been vacated.
      However, the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of
      satisfied or vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been
      satisfied or vacated.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1733 be repealed.  [The automatic
stay of Orders under CFJ renders Rule 1733 effectively redundant.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be amended to read:

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of
      VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal).

      At the end of the Voting Period of a given Proposal, the
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of VTs equal to
      the cost of the Votes cast on that Proposal by that entity.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended, byreplacing the
characters "Assessor" with "Banker" throughout, and by inserting the
following paragraph at the beginning of the Rule:

      There shall exist the Office of Banker.  The Banker shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 663, 1571, and 1573 be repealed.
[Judicial Orders cover everything that Injunctions cover.]

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
      performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
      (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
      satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
      an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
      time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, a Class C Crime.

      Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
      the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
      satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
      the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
      performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
      Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
      Class C Crime.

You are correct--it was disinfected on Dec. 18.  The most recently
published SLR is in error in that it still includes the viral
sentence in R1670.

I just thought of another problem with Proposal 3645.  It conflicts
with Proposal 3629.  Unfortunately, both passed, which means that the
Rules pertaining to Judgement are now probably quite scrambled.  Whee.

More grist for the Omnibus Reform Act...

For Crimes which have their penalties determined by reference to this
Rule, probably not.

Hm. How would you say R1483 applies here?

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

Seems to me prima facie that these Proposals have been distributed - 
and that notwithstanding that the Repeal-O-Matic has only been in
effect since Dec. 9.

I agree that they've been proposed, but am not sure that they've been
distributed.  You may be correct, however.

Yes, I misspoke. I actually don't think they've been distributed. But
I do think they've been proposed. Probably the first four are Proposals
made by Crito himself, the last two are Proposals made by the ROM.
