We had this debate a couple of months ago. I believe the Oxford
dictionary allows "nominate" to be a transitive or intransitive verb.
I know that the intransitive form is common use in committee ordinances.

If Plots are un-resurrectable, may I suggest we go back to my original
Jobs & Wages proto? This provided a regular weekly income, like the
welfare proposal, but gave you a way of choosing whether you wanted
VTs or P-Notes.

The new rule "Distributing Proposals" requires the Promotor to
distribute a batch of Proposals in every week.  What if there are no
Proposals in the queue in a given week?  (For the sake of discussion,
let's ignore the Repeal-O-Matic, which poots out a Proposal every
week, making this situation factually impossible.)

Does anything rule out zero-size batches?

I think that all attempts to force member nomics to have certain kinds
of rules and structures will fail, due to the unwillingness, and
partly inability, of members to implement all the requirements.

If we want a IN currency and other things I think we must manage to do
all inter-nomic bookkeeping on the IN level (through records
maintained according to IN rules by someone elected in
IN). Interaction between IN and member nomics, and among nomics, must
be conducted via the liaisons. In the case of a currency, e.g., the IN
records just say which nomic holds which amount of coins; all
transfers of coins between nomics must be conducted by the liaisons;
IN only accepts the liaisons' actions and reports of actions. It is
then up to individual nomics to either let their liaison do what e
wants, or limit eir coin related actions, introduce ways to assign
their nomics' coins to individual players etc.

I agree with Blob.  If we implement this solely at the level of IN,
then the result will not affect the component games enough.  Because
the Coin programme would require members nomics to alter their
rulesets, we'd get interesting situations where IN got its teeth.

On the other hand, some degree of book-keeping does have to be done at
the level of IN.  I think this is unavoidable.  

But do require the games of IN to change their rulesets.  What other
form of compulsion over its Players does IN have?  Then, as Blob
speculates in his message, you would get into interesting situations
where people would have to Judge whether or not component games' law
was up to scratch.

Michael.

Of course I understand that this is an interesting program. And I
won't oppose it or try to stop you. But I must admit I don't give it
much chances of success. Most nomics barely manage to cast a vote now
and then - the process of communicating current IN proposals to
players, making up their minds about them and then responding within
two weeks is something they are unable or unwilling to do.

So you may end up with a situation where the IN rules require a lot of
member nomics' rule changes, one or two nomics slowly begin to
implement these changes, and the others don't do anything. Except,
possibly, bother to tell us officially that they don't like it.

Oh well, I'm sorry to be sounding so negative. I guess the best thing
is for you to go ahead and give it a try. I'll certainly try hard to
help this succeed. Just try to keep it simple, so it does not
overwhelm IN's weak overall framework.

I can understand your concerns, and no, I don't think they're overly
negative.  I'm not expecting miracles, and would be appreciative of
even the most "softly softly" of approaches.  My view is that simply
having a long-term agenda might be fun in itself.  (Let's give Agora
the reputation of being the game with style and a long-term view of
IN. :-)

Well, then I don't see why 1-size batches should count either.

Perhaps, but I'd like to give it a try before giving up. Internomic would
certainly be more interesting if it was able to pose some form of sanctions
on Nomics that do not comply to certain agreed ideals. Of course, we can't
force them to do so, but we can make it so that failure to comply
adversely affects their Internomic standing. Maybe we could have more 
than two levels of membership status, with various conditions required
for each level.

I think I might work up a proto for this. It would probably be best 
to start out with just the framework, without any strong requirements,
so as to be non-contraversial (and not introduce any Agora-bias). Then
we can lobby for more specific requirements at a later date.

I think the solution might be, as I have suggested, not to force anybody
to comply, but to reward those who do comply with extra influence in
the game. Then those nomics who care about their IN standing are also the
ones who are likely to be willing to attempt to comply.

> Would probably lower the traffic on the mailing list quite a bit, too, which
> might be a Good Thing. :)

1.)    I don't think it would lower the traffic. I just got somewhere between
150 and 200 messages from Agora. Of these only about 10 were reports. I could
see it adding to the mail load. What with subscriptions and unsubscriptions,
associated TOs & POs, & additional mistakes and fixes arising from players not
knowing stuff from the reports. It would also add a whole new bulk of
paperwork. I don't like the idea. If we really want to lower traffic, then
abolish the TO/PO double handling paper shuffle. Make one transaction do the
job.

Don't get me wrong, I'd pay for these reports if I had the available currency.

Which raises another issue:
2.)    If we are busy paying for all sorts of reports and services and
proposal queues and such. How are we supposed to find any VTs to use
for.....um.......oh yeah......VOTING !  After all they are _voting_ tokens. It
seems as though we are being encouraged to spend all our VTs on everything
else but voting. If we have any VTs left over we'd best hold onto them for
next week's round of VT expenditure (after making 1 vote in order to get the
VT allotment for voting). I should think that the one thing we should be able
to do easily is vote on proposals. I would like to see a certain number of
'free' votes per player per week.

3.)    Incidentally, it would make it easier to follow threads if they didn't
have the group servers appended in front. When I get a message header like
"Re: DIS: Re: BUS: Re: OFF: ........Report" I have to look in three entirely
separate parts of the mail list to find the previous messages. I can't sort
the list by thread, date, alphabetic, or any other way to bring the messages
into close proximity. If the group server name was on the end of the header
then an alphabetic sort would bring them to adjacency.

Well that's my rant from the soapbox for the week.

Bye for Now

Well, I for one think its not a bug, but a feature. I didn't intend it
to work this way, but if I had have thought about it, I think this is 
what I would have wanted.

It's a neat compromise between two extremes. I don't think that an
Office held in perpetuity should be immune to Rebellions, but I also
think that it would be unfortunate if the perpetuity of an Office was
automatically cancelled by a Rebellion. The current situation is quite
elegant I think - an Election is held as a results of the rebellion,
but as long as Chuck wins the election, he gets to keep his perpetual
status.

I regard perpetuity as an infinite term of service. No election should
be held in the normal course of events, but Rebellions are about 
throwing the normal world on its head, and not even perpetual officers
should be immune to this.

Of course, as we have shown, some Officers can escape the revolution,
which is a bug that needs to be fixed. One of my fellow Threats should
be proposing such a fix sometime soon. Steve?

I think you'll find that the Office of Justiciar is not up for election
just yet.

I don't think it is a bug.

There is at least one bug in the perpetuity Rule though: it doesn't work
with Delegation.
