Protoproposal Chaos13 [rev. 3]

No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Recordkeepor may elect to reject any Transfer Order or Payment
      Order, the amount of which is not specified by its Executor as a
      fixed numeral.

      The actual numerical value of the amount of a Transfer or
      Payment Order whose amount was not specified by its Executor as
      a fixed numeral is whatever the Recordkeepor, in good faith,
      determines it to be at the time the Order was submitted.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a "fixed numeral" is a numerical
      constant specified in a manner that the Recordkeepor may
      determine its value with definite certainty without referring to
      any information in the Game State other than the message
      itself.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]

Here are my thoughts so far; I welcome comments.

The name "Plato", as mentioned in the Transfer Order that is at the
source of this debate, does not refer to a person whom any legal
system currently in existence would recognize as having any rights
or obligations.

Were the same kind of dispute to arise in an RL court, the case
would probably be dismissed on the grounds of "no controversy". No
descendants of the deceased Greek philosopher, and more generally no
legal or physical persons are currently charged with protecting any 
rights of morality or possession attaching to the estate of Plato. 
Therefore, in any dispute about Plato's supposed ownership of any 
conceivable kind of fictitious or actual possessions, nobody's rights 
are being violated, and there is nobody who might be said to have 
failed to perform any kind of obligation.

Now, Agora is not RL, and things that might seem absurd in RL can be
done in Agora for the sheer fun of it, that much is granted. However,
even for the purposes of Agora, the above line of reasoning should
alert us to the fact that Plato is, in all relevant respects, a
fictitious rather than a real person. Transferring some amount of a
Currency to, say, Homer rather than Plato would achieve identical
results; the names "Homer" and "Plato" in such cases serve as mere
labels used by a Player attempting to, jocularly as it were, divest
emself of some of eir possessions without specifying a beneficiary.

Transferring Currencies, on the other hand, to living persons such
as Larry Wall or William Gates might conceivably have different
effects. One may be more likely than the other to develop an
interest for Agora, register to play, and affect game play based on
the amount of Currencies transferred to em while not a Player.

With this distinction firmly in mind, I conclude that attempting to
transfer Currencies to a fictitious person should not be a legal Game
Move, on the grounds that except as stipulated in the Rules,
arbitrary legal fictions should not be allowed to be created to
affect game play. 

Couching this in terms of Rule 1011, which seems to be the only Rule
that could, or should, allow us to invalidate such attempts, is
unfortunately a more difficult exercise. It is possible that the
recently adopted term of "Nomic Property", as opposed to the older
"Nomic Entity", does not adequately safeguard against precisely that
kind of abuse of Rule 1598. 

I am therefore inclined to let Crito's Judgement stand.

D&R isn't a paradigm, is a useful phrase. All P.O.s are is a more
complex way of D&Ring Transfers that require a two or three way

I am also bothered, in that this was not the way I wanted to judge, but
I felt I would be remiss if I didn't actually judge the case based on
what information I had.  I guess I felt it would be better overall to
Judge and let the appeals court deal with any controversy, than it
would have been to dismiss the case.  (Which would have probably resulted
in either an appeal of the dismissal or a re-issue of the CFJ, both of which
would have bogged us down with the question for much longer.)

NO!  A Payment Order is _not_ a Transfer in any way, shape, or form.
Payment Orders are obligations.  

One of the major reasons for the Payment Order system is to allow for
Players to decide whether or not they will meet their obligations.
This makes disputing improper penalties more rational, and
significantly reduces the need to backtrack when penalties are
improperly applied.  

I assume that your Objects Proposal loses this important feature,
since you appear to fail to recognize its significance.  Yet another
reason for me to oppose it.

It seems to me Kudos do just fine with a "coined" term.  (With the execption
of one of favors that may still be buzzing.)  The term is supposed to
be vague because labeling them something like "Currencies" puts a
straightjacket on future iterations of the concept.  Suppose we want to 
invent a non-fungibile "Currency" like the powers?  The current structure
is so turgid, murky and filled with RL connotations of "Money" that I doubt
such an idea can even be incorperated into the current Currency framework.
If we wanted "powers" or my old proto "deeds" the only real way they could
be effective is if they bypassed the current system entirely. . .

I have a number of technical problems with this Proposal, which I will
detail later.  However, I believe Swann errs in eliminating the
Payment Order mechanism, and I believe his handling of Debt is wholly
unsatisfactory.  

First, Swann's Proposal loses the disputation protections that Payment
Orders create.  If this is adopted, I see NOTHING that would prevent
me from transferring, say, ten thousand VTs from everyone to myself,
and then alleging all of your Lawlessnesses (because you would each
receieve roughly 5000 Blots for doing so under Swann's revised Debt
rule).  My action would be a Crime, but the potential benefit of this
Crime exceeds its meager punishment.  This Proposal gives far too much
power to Recordkeepors, without adequate checks.

As far as Debt goes, basically, Swann has reintroduced the notion of
the Bank as universal lender, a notion I find appalling.  (It charges
Blots for this privilege, but it is still thus obliged.)  The Bank
should not be under any obligation to lend funds to Players.

Swann has also abrogated the notion of owner's control; control over
all Objects is assigned solely to "players designated by the Rules"
instead to owners.  This means that possessions are potentially
subject to "raiding" in the manner I mention above.

In short, this Proposal, while making potentially useful ground in
pragmatization of recordkeeping, is a giant step backwards in other
areas, and clearly needs serious reconsideration.  I urge its defeat.

I agree, an interesting experiment.  Of course a normal Power 1 proposal could
do away with it, too.  So it doesn't *really* require unanimous consensus, it's
more like unanimous consensus will create a really fast acting "Guillotine".

I also note that I believe that the PC system can be made nearly as
pragmatic as Swann's system by the addition of a single paragraph to
Rule 1598.  Proto to follow.

Protoproposal Chaos17 [rev. 1]

Pragmatization of Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended by appending the
following paragraph:

      The determination, for the purpose of this Rule, of whether an
      entity has sufficient Currency to execute a transfer shall be
      made based on the Recordkeepor's records at the time the
      transfer is executed.  A Recordkeepor's good faith determination
      that a transfer has succeeded or failed is definitive, even if
      it is based on erroneous information.

[Believe it or not, this single change is sufficient to eliminate
 almost all indeterminancy regarding the interplay of Currency
 Holdings upon other events.]

The attempt to destroy Currencies in Part 0will fail because it would
require the Proposal to contravene the Rules which presently cause
them to exist.  They will be destroyed eventually, but not as a result
of this provision.

The assignment of duties to Players will fail because a Proposal lacks
the power to bind Players to perform duties.  Reliance on provisions
which come later in the Proposal to grant meaning to such a provision
is unfounded, and will fail based on prior precedent.

In addition, no attempt is made to preserve or translate outstanding
Payment Orders.

The term "Object" is overbroad.

In the amendment to Rule 1467:
* What does it mean for an entity to "conform to a stricture"?
  Players must comform to the Rules; nothing requires an entity other
  than a Player to do so.  What happens to an Object or Class of
  Object which fails to conform?
* I consider The use of "X" as a language placeholder extremely
  nonstylish.  (This Proposal will get a -3 for Style when it is
  Promoted.)
* The assignment of the Chancellor as default Recordkeepor is
  inconsistent with other proposed Rules that make the Speaker default
  Recordkeepor.
* A number of the things in the list of strictures which Objects and
  Classes of Object must conform to are not strictures on either
  Objects or Classes of Objects; this is confusing.  Also, there is
  not a one-to-one correspondance between strictures and the list
  indices; list index "iii" specifies two strictures, one on Objects,
  and one on entities generally.

Generally, I believe the Legal State/Actual State dichotomy is
overcomplicated.  The same effect can be accomplished (as my recent
proto demonstrates) without having to rewrite 1/5 of the Ruleset.

In the new rule "Legal State and Actual State of Objects":
* When the actual state and legal state of an object disagree, the
  Recordkeepor is only empowered to change the state of that one
  object, but, contrarily, is also empowered to create, destroy, or
  transfer other objects as needed.  This is internally contradictory.

In the amendment to Rule 1578:
* Granting a Player permission to make a Claim of Error is redundant
  in light of Rule 113.
* The change provisions in this proposed Rule are redundant with those
  in the previous proposed Rule.

I disagree that Mintors and Mint Authority should be repealed.  This
proposal would grant far too many people the power to create and
destroy objects for my liking.  Obviously, its Proposer has never been
Assessor.

Regarding the creation and destrucution of objects: How can an object
have a legal state before it is actually created?  Contrariwise, how
can it have an actual state after it is legally destroyed?

I have already exercised my objection to making the Bank a universal
lender. 

In the amendment to Rule 1713, a reference to Convertibility lingers,
despite the comment that it was removed.

There are, needless to say, numerous typos in this Proposal.

I have my doubts that Personal Objects will work as you intend.

In the amendment to Rule 1601, what happens if an entity is destroyed
when it Legally posseses Objects, but not Actually possesses Objects?
Actually but not Legally?

The proposed Rule 1738 is ugly.  I feel I must respond to the comment
about "allowing debt in such a small economy": this attitude condemns
us to always having a small economy.  This proposal will hamper,
rather than encourage, the development of a viable private economy.

Why not do away with the Bank altogether, and just create and destroy
Objects as needed?  You've made the Bank, in effect, an infinite sink
and source.  By the way, there's a spin condition in this Proposal: if
the Bank gets a Blot, it will be forever transferred to itself.

I disagree that the Chancellor is a needless complication.  In fact,
the Chancellor helps to protects the Bank from Recordkeepor error; the
public handshake makes it easier for errors to be detected.  I don't
think anyone except the owner of an object should be allowed to do
anything with it.  The use of "owner" in this Proposal is disingenous
because "owners" don't actually own their objects.  Quite clearly, all
objects are owned by their respective Recordkeepors.

Well there are birth dates that some people think of as such points.  8)

True.  Certainly good faith is rather like a heap of sand.  But I note
that Swann's Proposal relies on equally shifty language in Rule 1665.
