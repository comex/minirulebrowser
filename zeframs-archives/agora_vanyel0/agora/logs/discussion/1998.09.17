I'm not really sure about this. The last sentence could also describe
the order the TOs appear in the Report, and not the order they were
placed there.

Then again, I don't find the argument in the CFJ very convincing 
either. Does anyone have any ideas?

I don't see what that has to do with it. Rule 1819 defines the effect of
noting a transfer, which is to transfer Currency from the source to the
destination. R1817 constrains the RK to note the transfers in the order
e receives them. Therefore the RK cannot note a transfer out of order,
which is what the truth of Kolja's Statement would require the RK to do.

Aha. I didn't realise that "noting a transfer" was a technical term.

Agora is not a maze. Ackanomic is a maze. Agora is a house that has

I think the crucial question you have to answer is "what is the status
of a TO if the condition (that its execution would leave the payor
with a negative amount of currency) is fulfilled?". 

The recordkeepor may, IMHO, still choose to execute the order in this
case. But if e doesn't, what then? Is the TO vacated, made invalid,
suspended until it can be satisfied without running into debt (my
opinion), to be ignored forever (Steve)?

I think that at least partly your judgement will have to be a creative
one, because all the above questions are not explicitly answered in
the rules (AFAICT, of course).

I'm not saying that the judgement must by all means be TRUE. It's just
thet I _would_ judge true, but I think Steve's position, based on the
requirement for the order in which TOs are to be satisfied has some
merits, too. It doesn't answer my questions, though.

Re: DIS: Re: OFF: CFJ 1107 (assigned to Blob) 

Actually, I think Steve's argument holds, because R1819 forces the time of the
actual transfer to be the time the Recordkeepor makes the notation in eir
records.  Therefore, the last sentence in R1817 is not simply a reference to
how TOs appear in the report, but a reference to the actual timing of the
transfer.

Rule 1819/0 (Power=1)
Effect of Transfer Orders

      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

I'm not really sure about this. The last sentence could also describe
the order the TOs appear in the Report, and not the order they were
placed there.

Then again, I don't find the argument in the CFJ very convincing 
either. Does anyone have any ideas?

I can see no inconsistency in the Rules on this question at all, only a
little unclarity about what 'ignoring a TO' amounts to. What I am quite
certain about is that 'ignoring a TO' does *not* mean 'waiting for the
payor to acquire sufficient funds to cover the amount of the TO, and
then executing the TO.' That directly contradicts R1817.

Given that this is the case, I give to 'ignoring a TO' the only sensible
interpretation there is left: the TO is ignored forever; it's treated
exactly like an invalid TO.

Er, right. Sending votes to me is not, of course, Public Voting. But it
also isn't voting.

OK, you're right about the language in R1817: it says that the RK is
not required to abide by a TO which would result in the payor possessing
a negative amount of Currency. But since that's what it says, how do you
get to the conclusion that R1817 requires the RK to abide by such a TO?
What R1817 says is that the RK is not required to abide by such a TO,
and that no TO can be noted out of order. The conclusion is clear: such
a TO cannot be noted at all.

Where this reference to "ignoring a TO" that we are debating? It's not 
in my copy. R1817 merely says that a RK is not required to abide by a TO
which would result in an entity posessing a negative quanitity of 
Currency.

There is no positive command to "ignore" such TOs, just a negative "is
not required to abide by". More importantly, e is required to abide
by TOs which do not result in negative holdings. So any TO which (at any
time) does not result in negative holdings, is required to be obeyed.

I think this Kolja is right. R1817 is inconsistent. Such a TO is required 
to be obeyed, but cannot be noted out of order. How do we resolve this?
