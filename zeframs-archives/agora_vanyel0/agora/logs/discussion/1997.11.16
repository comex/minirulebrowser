Zefram had a good proto which dealt with this more comprehensively (eg
it also made 'Inactive' and 'On Hold' synonymous).

I seem to recall that Swann's 'Objects' proto does away with Probate
altogther, and in a reasonably clear way. I'm interested in looking
into that.

The former address is the correct one. The latter is, I believe, defunct.

Send email to <majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au> with no Subject and 

subscribe <list-name> <your address>

in the body, where <list-name> is one of 'agora-official', etc.

I'll send you a copy of our Ruleset, although I warn you, it's very long.

Depends what you mean by 'compatible'. Your Initial Set below is quite
different to other Initial Sets I've seen (esp. the Rule limit, the Random
Events Rule, the game board), so naturally, Players of your game may
as a result have quite different views about what certain what
certain key words, like 'Proposal' or 'Rule' or 'Judgement', might
mean.  Nevertheless, Bluesmobile Nomic (if I may so call your game)
could participate in Internomic as easily as any of the other Nomics
do, since the Internomic Rules are designed to be more or less blind
to the Rules of its member Nomics. All you have to do is provide a Liaison.

I don't see that. Lowering Quorum will not increase complexity or
red tape in any way. Nor will it result in the same situation as
before. Had Quorum for Proposal 3585 been 5 or 6 instead of 9,
I doubt that opponents of the Proposal could have risked removing
their votes. Their only viable strategy would have been to defeat
the Proposal on the numbers. As to whether this is dull, see below.

One third of Players is not very low, in my opinion.

How? Calabresi and Vanyel are no more likely to declare Absence than
they are to declare Presence. Evidently they are not paying much
attention to the game at the moment. Nor do I see how declarations of
Absence are going to prevent the use of tactics such as those used to
defeat P3585.

It simply hands a tremendous advantage to the Promotor and anyone who is
lucky enough to live in a similar time zone.

Nevertheless, I wouldn't necessarily be against experimenting with such
a system in a temporary way. Explore the territory, as you say. But
I should point out that in your eagerness to explore the territory
available to us without lowering Quorum, you might have failed to notice
the snow-capped moutains and lush valleys just over the lowered-Quorum
horizon. It is a much under-appreciated fact that Quorum ultimately
defines the minimum size of any conspiracy which relies on making a
Proposal and getting it passed in some way. For a long, long time, 
we've set Quorum around here very high - and by so doing discouraged 
such conspiracies. If we lower Quorum to 1/3 of Active Players, who
knows what may be possible? *Lots* of new territory to explore.

In my opinion, it was this single stroke alone that ensured the
defeat of the Zombiemaster conspiracy. Had Morendil instead chosen to
side with us, we could have relied not only on his three votes, but
also on double votes from Swann, Zefram, Elde, Blob, and Antimatter
- potentially 13 more votes. I doubt you could have defeated us. I
daresay that Morendil is now rueing his decision. I certainly am.

I note that the Appeal Judgement of CFJ 1053 is inconsistent with the
Judgement of CFJ 1054, in which Harlequin ruled that Elde could not
be Blob's Executor because Elde is not a Player.

It would appear that someone, such as myself, who is extremely skeptical
of the correctness of the Board's decision in CFJ 1053, can appeal to
the Judgement of CFJ 1054 in support of their view.

Who is Blob's Executor and who is responsible for executing eir
Probate? Me or Morendil? I don't think I'm prepared to accept the
status quo. Harlequin's Judgement is just as good as the Board's,
precedes it by several weeks, was entirely ignored by the Board
(dissenting Justice elJefe excepted) - who are supposed to at least
consider past Judgements - and has never been contested. On what
basis is it being ignored now?

How should we resolve this situation?

Slight correction: Vlad's 'Judgement' was not a Judgement, since it
was sent late.

Nevertheless, this Judgement is in conflict with the quite sensible
principles eludicated by Judge Michael in his Judgement of CFJ 1063,
from which I quote:

      The rules do not mandate what it is for entities to own or
      possess Currencies.  Yet it is precisely this ability which is
      presupposed in the rules and practice involved with Transfer
      Orders.  Therefore, we use common sense in order to resolve
      this question, and conclude that VTs can not possess VTs.

      To reiterate: it is patently not common-sensical to allow units
      of currency to own other units of currency.  Given the absence
      of legislation specifying that this should be possible, there
      seems little reason to suppose that it should be possible.

It seems just as obvious to me that Greek philosophers dead for millenia
are no more capable of possessing VTs than other VTs are.

My proposal would be thus:

Count Quorum not for Proposals, but for batches. If a Player takes an
action on ANY Proposal of a batch, e counts as present for ALL Proposals
in that batch. To avoid too much influence of the Promotor in this, we could
specify that no batches may be promoted within, say, 4 days of one another.

I don't see any inconsistency here. There is a Rule that says that an
Entity's Executor must be a Player. There is no Rule that says that an
Entity's Executor in Probate must be a Player (except at the moment that
e is named such). Thus, when somebody who is an Entity's Executor and 
Executor in Probate ceases to be a Player, e ceases to be that Entity's
Executor, but does not cease to be that Entity's EiP. 

I also refer to Harlequin's Judgement: He never claims, or even implies,
that Elde is not Blob's EiP, only that Elde is not Blob's Executor.

I do not agree. If they could not be reconciled, you would have a point,
but they can be reconciled, so I'd say they both apply.

> Who is Blob's Executor and who is responsible for executing eir
> Probate? Me or Morendil?

Why? Elde, of course...

Elde was selected Blob's EiP.
	Elde becomes Blob's Executor and EiP.
Morendil registers Blob
	Elde stays Blob's Executor and EiP.
Elde is deregistered once again.
	Elde remains Blob's EiP. Elde cannot remain Blob's Executor. As no
	 Rule specifies another Executor, Blob becomes eir own Executor.
Blob is deregistered.
	Elde is still Blob's EiP. Blob has no Executor.

None of these steps would have changed EiP
However, as it is a generally accepted principle that the Rules cannot
force non-Players (perhaps apart from a few very specific cases), in practice
noone is responsible until Elde reregisters.

Until shortly Morendil did have the right to do this (as Elde's Executor), but
I think that has been repealed in Exorcise Probate.

I agree that I should have looked at Harlequin's Judgement when making
mine, and did not do so. However, even if I had considered it, I would
have made the same Judgement. And I would not have found my Judgement
and Harlequin's inconsistent.

> How should we resolve this situation?

If someone is deregistered, e remains Executor in Probate of any entity
of which e was Executor in Probate. As e is not a Player anymore, e is
not that entity's Executor anymore, except that e wasn't that entity's
Executor anyway because of 'Exorcise Probate'.

By the way, I do think that Harlequin's Judgement has no effect anymore.
But that is not because of the CFJ 1053 Judgement, but because of Exorcise
Probate.

I suppose you are right that this step caused our victory.

The supporters were apparently who I thought they were, so the Guillotine
Scam could have worked (barely) if we had put our mind to it and you
hadn't caught on in time, but alas there were only 5-6 people signing and
I soon had to give up that idea.

I'll have to say that I was at a time rather tempted by your offer to
switch sides - I was starting to believe that at least one of Scott, Vlad
and Chuck were on your side, as they hadn't responded (Scott later did.) 
However just after that Vanyel responded and I got more optimistic.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

It is not as we haven't discussed the problems with batches previously...

The concept of "Proposals distributed in a given Nomic Week" has been used
previously to great advantage.

Well:

1) Presumably a new Justice would have to be selected, since the Speaker
would have defaulted?

2) 3581 was not a Senate Proposal anyhow.  This makes things complicated:
  a) Certain Zombie masters did not try to make their Zombies Vote because
they _thought_ 3581 was a Senate Proposal.
  b) Certain Zombie masters were not the EiPs of the Zombies they thought
they were.
  c) Scott held back and Andre retracted Votes on 3581 because they
thought their Votes were unnecessary, and did not take Murphy's Law into
account.

Suffice it to say that if 3581 turns out to have failed, I will be _quite_
angry at the Players mentioned in (2c).

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Urm. I recall that I deregistered myself after being registered as 
a Zombie (a tactic the other Zombies could have used as well), since 
I intend to reregister as a real player again sometime (preferably 
after Probate is fixed completely).

RANDOM capitalization, indeed.  My capitalization bases it on logical
PRINCIPLES.  You look out until to think that Madness implies incoherence.

But IT IS MERELY you SUBHUMANS some not can comprehend HIGHER forms for
LOGIC.  Science REQUIRES logic - is it so difficult to understand that a
true scientific genius must follow logic, and haunt it to its doorstep?

I assume you mean 'the real Speaker, it having been discovered that Morendil
is not the Speaker'. But this misses the point of the paradox. Assume for
the sake of argument that the other Justices are split 1-1 on this question
and that Morendil's decision is therefore decisive. Then he is the Speaker
if and only if he is not the Speaker. If we accept the validity of his
Judgement we have to deny the validity of his Judgement. If we deny the
validity of his Judgement, we have no reason to think he not the Speaker,
and therefore we must accept the validity of his Judgement.

Of course, the situation is avoided if the other Justices agree on a
Judgement.

That is true. Is your point that you could not have voted, or that
Swann, Zefram and Blob could have done likewise? Of course, it's an
open question whether they *would* have done so.

I'm concerned that this might open a loophole allowing Players to avoid
debts by deregistering and reregistering.

This position is in flat contradiction with the Rules (as they were
at the time). R1738/0: The EiP of an entity is the Executor of that
Entity. Therefore, you cannot maintain consistently with the Rules
that a person can be an EiP of an entity but not be its Executor.

'Exorcise Probate' cannot act retroactively. I maintain that CFJs
1053 and 1054 are inconsistent with each other, since your defence
above is simply directly in contradiction with R1738/0 (and I remind
you of R451). In my opinion, the Board's decision in CFJ 1053 suffers
from the same flaw of directly contradicting the Rules. I therefore
think that I have *at least* as good a claim to being Blob's Executor at
the time I registered him and voted on his behalf on Proposal 3585 as
anyone else does to the contrary.

Of course you don't maintain consistency:  The whole point as I understand
it is that Rules were _in conflict_ and R1738/0 lost.

Therefore, the requirement that the EiP be the Executor was void.

Also, if the newly selected Justice agrees with Morendil - then Morendil's
improper Judgement would simply not matter. 

We have been working with split Game states before, they must be good for
something...

It wouldn't matter as much, but it still wouldn't collapse the game
state. Who, for instance, earns the Judicial Salary? Morendil, or his
replacement?

I don't quite see the problem:

Once it were agreed by the Justices in both gamestates that Morendil were
not the speaker, the gamestate would collapse, and Morendil would _not_
receive the salary, never having properly been Justice in the first place. 

The only problem would be if Morendil judged that he was not the Speaker,
while the other Justice judged that he was - then there would be a
paradox.

I presume that we would then have to agree on the truth through some other
means, and to decide what happens when an obviously false Appeal Judgement
has been made.

Greetings,
Ørjan.
