I didn't say that.  I stated that a Transfer Order in P-Notes which
claims to satisfy a Payment order in Indulgences is necessarily
invalid.

Sure I can, but that takes a few seconds as I arrow up there
and manually type it in. It is faster to copy the from address, hit
'C' to start a new message, and paste it in the to slot.

I'm afraid the Rules don't allow you to pay off only part of a PO.  It's all or
nothing.  The rules also safeguard against you losing those 1.2 VTs for
nothing, however.  The above TO is invalid since it cannot satisfy
the referenced PO.

I note that the Chancellor had not yet paid you that Indulgence, anyway.
So this transfer fails.  However, because of that old bug, of which Andre
so kindly reminded us, your attempted transfer succeeds in satisfying
the PO.  So it looks like you'll be able to pay off that last Blot anyway.

Yes.  I've noticed them in the messages when they come back
to me, but I don't know where they are coming from.  I keep
making sure there is nothing trailing my messages when I
send them.  I suspect it may have something to do with the
font formatting that Groupwise tries to do with messages,
but I can't figure out how to correct the problem.  Any of

I agree with Murphy's assertion that "does not exist" is not equivalent to "is equal
to zero".  However, I disagree with eir conclusion that this equivalency was
necessary to judge the statement TRUE.  My contention was that "does not exist"
*is* a Salary specification, albeit a technically different one from "is zero".  And since
R1007 can only set the Salary if no other Rule specifies one, it fails to do so.

Then would you please refrain from adding future voting debts
incurred by myself to this PO? Although I do not intend to pay
those 2.4 VTs, I do want to pay my other expenses.

I would be happy to refrain from this, but you should direct this
request to the Assessor.  I'm just required to process the POs in
the form in which they are presented to me.  8)

This seems to suffer from the same problem as the current system.  A
transfer doesn't actually have to succeed in transferring Currency to
be a validly executed transfer.  It just has to be submitted to the
recordkeepor.

I've rewritten this; how does this look?

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      (a) A transfer is valid if:
        (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
            which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
            Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
            transfers on behalf of that entity;
        (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
        (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
            Currency's MUQ;
        (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
            that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
            Currency; and
        (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
            particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
            capable of being satisfied by that transfer.

      (b) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
          the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
          this Notice shall set forth:
        (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
        (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
        (3) the Currency involved;
        (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
        (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
            purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the
            requirements of another Rule.

(full revised proto will follow eventually)

I voted for it a few hours ago.  Also, note that Voting will cost 1.2

It should be noted, however, that I am required to publish the number
of each Proposal in the Queue, at least once each week.  Agora Rule

Could you explain this? I thought Blob set the 1.2 rate a week ago.
If it takes a week to take effect, why did it cost 1.2 vts to vote
on 3829/3830?

According to my records, I set the Voting Tariff to 1.2 on Monday Jan 18. 
So it has been in effect for all proposals distributed since Monday Jan 25.
The change I made yesterday will not come into effect until next Monday.

Is there any reason not to have it take effect immediately? After all,
we're only billed when the Proposal results are announced, or we

Because then the Assessor could set the level to the maximum all the
time, except when e wishes to Vote, when e would briefly set it to

Not if we are billed when the results are announced. Then we all pay
the same rate--whatever it is when the results are announced--
including the Assessor.

This makes it rather hard to decide whether or not to cast Votes,
though.  Otherwise, you might cast Votes on an assurance that the
Tariff will remain low, and then have the Assessor raise it to some
value such that you cannot afford the Votes you cast.

It seems quite clear that the Tariff needs to be fixed at the time of
distribution of the Proposals for there to be any sort of equitable
treatment.

Well, I for one would prefer to know how much voting will cost before 
I vote! And I would also prefer to know how much voting will cost before
I arrange to have my proposals distributed. It can have a significant
effect on the outcome of a proposal.

Well, Proposals are distributed once a week, and the Tariff is
set once a week. Just have the Assessor set the tariff when the
Proposals come out.
