That makes it easier, then:  "When a Player issues a Payment Order naming
an Inactive Player as payee, the issuer shall order the stay of that Payment
Order as soon as possible.  When the payee becomes Active, the issuer shall
order the vacation of the Order to Stay as soon as possible."

I'm not sure whether the stay should be required to be immediate or just
ASAP, though.  Both have drawbacks.

What would be wrong with wording such as the following (a possible amendment
of R1713):

       An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
       effective, has been effective for more than seven days (excluding
       days on which the Payor was on hold) and has not been satisfied.

I would be satisfied with a rule that stated that "Any Payment Order
issued to a Player who is On Hold is automatically stayed by operation
of law until such time as that Player comes Off Hold or is
deregistered."

IMO, the automatic issuance of stays is not problematic, because
the resolution of whether or not a stay is in force can be safely
deferred to judicial review.

H. Distributor Steve,
I seem to be having some minor difficulty in posting...  I have included
below a message I got in response to a recent test post I made.  The test
post was ultimately successful, but I thought I should make you aware of the
situation (hopefully you'll receive this :) ).

Does anyone know whether Steve issued a Wizard Report for P3769-3771?
If not, then I guess I have to do it soon.

Doesn't this fall short of the requirements of R1567 in that is doesn't name
a specific CFJ?  I have no problem with one being able to choose not to be a
Judge but the Rules don't seem to allow this move (assuming I haven't missed
anything).
