I'll take the appropriate action when I see the vacation order, and
the Accountor's reversing order.  As it is, I'm just discharging my
obligations under whatever rule it is that I fell foul of in not
paying salaries promptly.

This is all a bit trees falling over in forests and no-one hearing
them, but if Murphy sent a message that no-one received, then does it
count as being a post to the PF?  I don't think so.  If not, then the
Election can hardly be said to have been announced then.  Rather, I
believe that the post announcing the message was actually sent at the
later time.  (This issue also affects the question of whether or not
Murphy managed to nominate for Notary.)

In any case, I deny the COE and encourage you to CFJ if you feel that
the issue needs further exploration.

Michael.

Various things I've spotted that seem wrong with the latest report.
Incidentally, can you not use hyphens for negative numbers instead of
underscores? 

> VACATED PAYMENT ORDERS
> ID  Exec. Vacated Amt.  Payor Payee Executor
 
[...]

This looks like an error of some sort.

Do you think you could standardise on just one date format?  Two
within the same line seems a bit over the top.

Something has gone wrong here too.

Thanks, i will look into this.  I appreciate you prompt attention to
the report.  I need to get this report correct.  I could have issued
the 20ths report yesterday, but Crito's comment in a TO prompted me to
find the errors in this report, i included the vacations that blob
mentioned.  I suppose it is because of one of those vacations that e
got a negative number of VT's.  I will figure out which TO failed and
reissue the report.  I ill then reissue the 13ths and issue the 20ths,
and i hope the 27ths.  I have been unable to make a report that handles
all the calculations in the database i tried to put the information in.
 I am still working from a spread sheet.  I find this very time
consuming.  I have been unable to calculate record transactions every
day as i would like, because i do not yet have a stable report that i
can start from.  I am at least trying to keep up with recording the
transactions.

If anybody thinks they can do a better job, i welcome them to try.  I
am also open to suggestions on how to manage this better myself.

I would support this, but leave the 50% in the generic rule as a default limit.

I've always thought a Rule that says "so-and-so shall..." is equivalent to
requiring and empowering so-and-so to do "...".  But I think others may have a
different view.

That's my reading of the R1834.  However, you could play it safe and say "the
Player who Called for the Revolt" is exempt.
