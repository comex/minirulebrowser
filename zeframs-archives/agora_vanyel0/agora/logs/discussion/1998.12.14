Hm. Michael is On Hold, and therefore absolved of all responsibilities.
However, this doesn't seem to help him in this case, since R1865 states
that "Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days...
commits the Infraction of Failure to Propose".

That's obviously a bug, and of a type we've seen before (but when
exactly? I can't recall). It happens because R1865 doesn't operate by
obligating Players to do anything; it just sets out the consequences of
certain ways of behaving. R1584 is powerless to absolve Players of
responsibilities they don't have. 

But what's the best way to fix this? If we set the Status of Players who
go On Hold to Served, then it'll be too easy to avoid ever being
Required to Serve (changing the minimum On Hold time to a week, as I
recently proposed but narrowly failed to do, might help here).

Avoiding this is not hard anyway - one goes to served by making a Proposal,
independent of whether this Proposal is of any use. Submitting a null
Proposal each week is in fact easier than going On Hold each week, and as
succesful.

Yeah, but the point of going On Hold is that one might not have a way 
to post anything of legal significance for some period of time.

That's true, but I'm thinking of proposing to close this loophole, which
will make the On Hold loophole more tempting if we don't also close that.

As to how I'm planning to close the loophole...we'll there are two
options. The first doesn't really close the loophole, but only makes it
slightly smaller to crawl through: simply say that submitting a null
Proposal doesn't cause one's Status to be set to Served. The second is a
bit more interesting and involves giving the Promotor the discretion to
decide whether a Proposal is substantial enough to warrant setting one's
Status to Served. One could make this decision subject to Judicial
review, like the Assessor's determination that a Player has "effective
control" of assets.

What do you think?

That was my first reaction too, but then I realized that Andre's point
was just the opposite: that we might as well fix the loophole by
changing the Status of any Player who goes On Hold to Served, since it's
just as easy to propose a null Proposal as it is to go On Hold, if one's
aim is to avoid Public Service. But see my last post responding to this
point.

These POs are substantially overdue, but I haven't seen any PI
infractions against the Chancellor.  What's the deal?

Penalties were due and billable for the orders issued 24 November on
the 7th and again today; penalties were due and billable for the
orders issued between 30 November and 2 December today.  By my lights,
there is no excuse for the Promotor to not levy a PI Infraction
against the Chancellor.

H. Assessor Blob,

I hereby vote as follows:

3816: 2xAGAINST; by all means rotate Judgeships - but don't let the CotC
simply select the Judge for each CFJ as e sees fit. Players must be able
to trust the results of the Judicial system.

3817: FOR
3818: 2xFOR

Andre,

I think you are mistaken.  I remember deliberately changing the address to business because of
that.  Unfortunately, I did not save the message, so I can't prove it.  Oh, well.

Unless I am mistaken, your assent was made on nomic-discussion, and
thus invalid.

To my mind, game custom is irrelevant.  Rule101 settles the question most definitely
in favor of new Rules taking precedence over former Rules.  Since it has Power 3 and is
the lowest number Rule in the set, I think that's pretty definitive.  The argument that the
two forms of the R693 do not conflict seems pretty strained to me (one says x = 7, the other
says x = 10, what clearer example of a conflict could you possibly give?).  The Rules define
what a Proposal is.  The Rules define what a Voting Period is.   R101 tells us we must use
the current form of the Rules to determine what those definitions are. 

This leads straight to the conclusion, admittedly counter-intuitive, that the Rules define an
entity or attribute called Voting Period that is associated with *all* proposals - even past ones.
And that this entity or attribute has a duration attribute of seven days.  This does not change
the old  Voting Periods of past proposals, it merely changes the current designation (all
proposals used to be blue, now all of them have been painted red).  The VP of a proposal was
whatever it was in the past.  And what it was at the time a vote was cast is what counts.  This is
not all that whacky, IMO, and I am surprised (and disappointed) at the hoops people are going
through to try to avoid this conclusion.

Ah, but the thing that is happening here is the current cursor of time, if you will,
moving through the times defined as the beginning or end of a VP.  But these
are events that need not occur for the *definition* of a VP to be valid.  For the
proposals in question, these conclusion events did not occur, but the defined VPs
still do not extend beyond the seven days specified in the Rules.

Neither have I; I didn't know I would be Registrar at that moment. If you
say so, I guess you're right. I'll make a new Registrar's report.

It would be nice if you actually read my arguments and responded to
them. I think I'll just requote my argument above:

     The simple retort that new verions of Rules take precedence of old
     ones, for example, does not settle the question, for it is not
     necessarily the case that the old and new version of R693 are in
     conflict. Whether they are understood to be in conflict depends on
     how you see the operation of R693. Does R693 establish the VPs of a
     Proposal when it is distributed by a kind of 'set and forget'
     method, or is the VP of a Proposal in a relationship of continuous
     dependence on the precise text of R693? If it is the former, then
     the old and new versions are not in conflict, for we can understand
     each new version of R693 as applying only to Proposals distributed
     after that version takes effect. If it is the latter, then the two
     versions are in conflict, and an understanding analogous to that of
     the Guillotine seems appropriate.

I'm not saying which view I favour. It may surprise you to know that in
the Judgement I'm working on for CFJ 1111, I'm leaning toward the latter
view. But the former view has to be confronted and it *does* have game
custom on its side.

Actually, I'm not quite leaning to the latter view: the Guillotine does
not attempt to act retroactively. See below.

As far as I'm concerned, the VP of a Proposal cannot conclude unless
unless the "conclusion of the Voting Period" occurs. I offer an analogy
which I think shows just how weird your view is. Consider Rule 1863 (A
Duty to Vote), which was created on Oct. 6, 1998, and which contains
this provision: "Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule
shall repeal itself." This means that at present, we are currently a
little over two months into what we might call the R1863-period, which
is analogous to the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal. Now, we were
a little over 7 days into the 10-day prescribed VPs for P3810-3812 when
R693 was amended to change VPs from 10 days to 7. The analogous change
to R1863 would be an amendment right now changing "Three months" to "Two
months". I hope you will agree that such an amendment would not have the
effect of repealing the Rule, and that in fact, in that case the Rule
would not be repealed at all without further legislation. By analogy, we
ought to think that the VPs of P3810-3812 have not yet concluded, and
that they will not do so until further legislation is adopted. Talking
about a designated 2-month R1863-period seems to me to be completely
besides the point. There can't be a repeal unless the Rules say there is
one, and I'm arguing similarly that there can't be a conclusion of
Voting Period unless the Rules say there is one.

So elect a CotC you can trust! Make em issue an SLC promising not to
abuse the system. E could even promise to always select Judges randomly.
This rule change does not _force_ em to abuse it, you know.

Our elections are never going to be interesting as long as we refuse 
to give our Officers any leeway. Who cares which CotC we elect at the 
moment? They are all forced to operate in exactly the same way! We might
as well go back to the "pick whoever volunteers first" mechanism.

We have all these interesting mechanisms in place - elections, impeachment, 
rebellion, etc, but we prevent them from having any real use because we
legislate our Officer's actions so tightly. Let's give them more room to
choose their actions, so we can have more fun electing someone we can
trust, and keeping them honest by threats of Rebellion or Impeachment. 

Remember that the Appeals process is still in place, which acts as a 
check against any real abuse anyway. And if the rotating judgeship
proposal also passes, then the CotC will be prevented from selecting 
them same player all the time anyway, so opportunities for dangerous
misuse of power will be limited. And the rest of it we can hold back by
political means.

I am not going to levy them against Morendil, because he just became
Chancellor and it is not his fault. I'm not sure that I am necessarily
permitted to levy them against Michael anymore. I'll check the rules.

Crito,

Your messages are running well over 80 characters per line. I'd really
appreciate it (as would others, I imagine) if you could work out a way to

There's some merit in what you say, but experience teaches me to be much
more cautious where the Judicial system is concerned. Players who
suspect that Judgements are being produced by a purely political process
will be unlikely to accept the legitimacy of Judgements they do not
agree with - and this meta-game agreement is one of the pillars on which
the game rests.

Nothing obliges us to have the Clerk of the Courts sit on Appeals
Boards by default.
