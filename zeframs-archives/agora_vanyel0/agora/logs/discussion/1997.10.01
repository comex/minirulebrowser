That aside, I don't think I fully understand how you think the

Hm, no, I don't think so.  It actually happens that I believe Rule
1011 is largely vacuous; since properties established as a matter of
law can only be changed by changing the law, it is pointless to talk
of "changing" them in any other way, and the ability to change natural
properties of entities is limited by natural law, without regard to
Rule 1011 anyway.  All Rule 1011 does is make it illegal to change a
natural property of an entity in a manner inconsistent with the Rules.

The latter power is not generally referred to as agency.  An "agent"
performs the actual work; the entity giving the command is not the
agent.  Agency refers to the power to perform a given act, not to the
power to compel it.

In this sense, Vlad's statement is not ambiguous.

A procedure is designated by which each Player may destroy the VTs
which e owns.  It is impossible for you to destroy my VTs, but it is
not impossible for you to destroy your own, and since you are
compelled to follow the Rules to the best of your ability, you should
at least destroy your own VTs.  It is possible, but illegal, for me
(as Assessor) to destroy everyone's VTs; the high-Power Rule 1011
makes it illegal to destroy VTs except in accordance to a procedure
specified in the Rules, and Rule 1579, were it to say "shall be
destroyed", would nonetheless specify no applicable procedure.  (I
think.)

Admittedly, this means that I admit that it may not be possible to
obey the Rules at all times.  I'm not bothered by that very much.

I must concede Oerjan's point, that the Rule requires that they are
destroyed, not that they shall be destroyed, so the issue is moot.

No. That's not an analogous situation. If we were engaging in a 
discussion for a couple messages about whether you had committed the 
Crime of Silly CFJ Submission, and then I made a CFJ with a statement 
"Vlad committed the crime", then you would indeed have a ready defense. 
Your counterexample involved the definition of terms, but "Vlad" is a 
recognized Agoran term referring to you. Not so with "lacking agency." By 
the way, I'm sorry if I sounded annoyed at the CFJ in my original 
message. Looking back it seemed a little snippy of me.

That's semantics; compelling someone to do something is an act, just as 
capable of being performed as any other act. An FBI 'agent' is capable of 
compelling a person to do something.

You suggest opening the debate, but don't present your own ideas
on it?  Shame!  Anyway, before I provide my answer, a quick analysis
of what the issues are likely to be:

"I", "have", "unicorns", "in", "my", and "this" seem like they
will be relatively uncontroversial in their status as words.
(Sorry, I phrased that badly, but I can't think of a better
way off-hand to say what I mean.)

4: is an arabic numeral a word?
over-bollixed: is a hyphenated "word" one word or two?  If one,
  is a non-standard hyphenated "word", made of standard components
  a word?
formlches: is a non-standard "word" a word?
a.m.: is an abbreviation a word?  Is it one word regardless, or
  do we count the words it stands for?

I would answer as follows (these are based on intuition only):
4: yes
over-bollixed: one, yes.
formlches: yes
a.m.: yes, one

For a total of 10 words.

Chuck

>From WWWebster Dictionary
1 : the capacity, condition, or state of acting or of exerting power

The question is ... do the rules have this capacity?

Can the rules extert power over anything?  is the question at hand.  If
they can, they have agency, but that doesn't answer the question of if they
can extert power over the game state directly.  If they can't, they don't
have agency, and that does answer the question.  The rules are silent on
whether or not they have agency.  Can they actually modify anything?  The
Ruleset is part of the game state.  Rules are allowed to repeal themselves.
 Therefore, the Rules are allowed to change the game state.  Therefore, The
Rules have agency.

My word processors all agree: 10 words. I agree with everything you said, 
except that I would not feel uncomfortable counting hyphenated words as 2 
words.

Plus, any programmer will tell you that 4 is not a word, it's a byte.

No, 4 is a bit: 10 to the 10nd power :-)

What's wrong with its treatment of conflicting amendments?

I would have thought that it treated them as well as the time-sliced
model; the amendments apply in order and later amendments may have
unexpected effects.

Yes, I was too glib.  It seems to me that R594 would just disallow the
smallest possible subset of the provisions necessary to make the
situation clear.  That does allow for severability.  

I guess my claim is that provisions don't have to be invalidated in
and of themselves but can be done so in the context of their sibling
provisions.  

In any case, I begin to wonder if it _is_ possible to come up with
provisions that are severable and which are properly paradoxical (just
bringing about paradoxical rules doesn't count, as previously
discussed).  To get a paradox it seems likely that you will need some
form of mutual reference in the various provisions, and this will
almost certainly be prima facie evidence that the provisions aren't
actually severable.

Michael.

A quick look at the elm source here shows that the relevant lines are

mailmsg2.c:           fprintf(reply, attribution, very_long_buffer);
mailmsg2.c:           fprintf(reply, attribution, current_header->from);

which implies that there is no set of available variables; the %s in
attribution is simply the signal to fprintf to insert the next argument as
a substring at that point. %d probably inserted something like the pointer
address of the string instead, and then there was no argument left over
for %s.

Since the date is not included at all in the function call, you will not
be able to do what you want without changing the source.

Looking at my dictionary.... agency: Active power or force. "The Rules

I have thought of a more useful reply.  I think it might be reasonable to say
that "taking on a belief" is an action, in some sense, especially with respect
to abstract entities.  Therefore, Scott's views about Player and Rule agency
can be consistent with actual game custom in this sense.  We don't have to
grant the Rules agency to create and destroy Currencies, we grant them the
power to compel Players to take on certain beliefs about Currencies.

Fine, although I'd clarify by saying each individual Player grants that
power to the Rules.

So if your CFJ is judged TRUE, we may as well disband the game?

Nah, I think this would just attempt to establish a particular philosophical
viewpoint as game custom.  Some people think of the Rules as being able to act
in the abstract realm, others think the Rules can only compel Players to act
(via meta-game agreement and possibly R101).

Personally, I think compelling Players to believe certain things about the game
state is equivalent to compelling them to "act" (or, if not equivalent, at
least as much a part of the meta-game agreement as compelled physical action),
so that there is no practical difference in which of the above viewpoints you
take.

Yes, but if "the rules lack agency," under this definition, then the 
Rules can do neither of the things above.

Your word processors probably just count whitespace-separated strings. 
I realized that my analysis matched that in this case, but I would not
agree in general.  For example:

The Rules do not compel Players to believe certain things about the
Game State; rather, they compel Players to act as certain things were
true (or false) regardless of the actual state of affairs.  It is
impossible for any body of law to compel belief; at most, they can
compel people to act as if they hold a given belief.

Not at all.  Nobody is denying that the Rules have passive power,
actualized through their agents: the Officers and other Players under
their authority.

But, as I understand legal deeming, CFJs must be judged on the
legal state rather than the factual state.  Wouldn't it therefore
(given your view) be valid to judge a CFJ which said "The Rules compel
Players to believe certain things about the Game State" to be TRUE?

I will regard this as having been sent to me, since I did receive it.
(Curiously, this way the message takes legal effect when it reaches my

The power to compel and the power to enforce that compulsion are
distinct and separate.  An FBI agent has the power (in law) to enforce
a compulsion established by Congress, but has no power (in law,
although perhaps not in fact) to impose a compulsion of his own
liking.  Congress has no power to enforce the compulsions it enacts
into law; it relies on the executive branch, including organs such as
the FBI, to act as its agents in imposing its compulsions.

A less complex example is the combination of a judge and a sheriff.
The judge writes the arrest warrant, and thus has the power to compel;
the sheriff arrests the person, as the agent of the judge.

Right.  In this case, the illusion of independent agency is created by
the requirement that Players act as if the transfers had occured prior
to their recording.  In fact, the Rules change nothing; the only
change is when the Recordkeepor adjust eir records in the manner
required of em by the Rules.

Well, I should think I know what is openly going on in Agora.  What I
would like to see is news from other nomics.  What about some kind of
Internomic news service? The individual newspapers for various nomics all
seem to have folded.

Greetings,

No body of law is capable of compelling belief.  The Rules are a body
of law.  Therefore, the Rules do not compel belief.

I should have clarified.  I agree that if the Rules attempted to
compel belief, they would be incapable of enforcing that provision.
Why can't the Rules legally compel belief?  (IIRC, you once claimed
that the Rules could legally compel actions of non-Players, even
though such provisions would be _de facto_ meaningless since
there would be no way of enforcing such a provision.)  Or perhaps
you are using "compel" to mean "both creating and enforcing an
obligation?"

An Injunction may name multiple persons and require them to perform
multiple acts; I therefore see only four Injunctions.

The Rules can attempt to compel belief; and I think we both agree that
they would fail should they attempt to do so.  That is why I believe
the subject CFJ would be false: to assert that it must be true as a
matter of law is to equally assert that the Rules cannot be broken,
and that any CFJ alleging that a Rule has been broken is therefore
unavoidably false, as a matter of law.  

The question of a person's belief is a question of fact, not a
question of law.  IMO, a court is entitled to investigate questions of
fact, including facts superseded or made irrelevant by provisions of
law, but may not make use of findings of fact which are thus
superseded or made irrelevant by provisions of law when making
determinations of law.  (Does that make sense?)

Ooops - the question being, did you deliberately wait so long to 
reply to the above post to make me look silly ? (Then again, I 
suppose I did an adequate job of it myself in this instance...)

As I do believe that the randomness in quantum mechanics is inherent,
whether it is according to the Copenhagen or the many-worlds explanation,
I do not agree with you.

I see your point in general, but how does this work with legal
deeming in Agora?  Suppose we have the following Rule:

1997. Scott Is Stoopid
Scott is deemed to believe that Thomas Jefferson was the first
President of the United States.

My understanding of legal deeming is that the CFJ

"Scott believes that Thomas Jefferson was the first President
of the United States"

would have to be judged TRUE, yes?  If so, how would one
(if it is possible at all) phrase a CFJ to investigate the
matter of Scott's actual belief?  (Assuming for the sake
of argument that it is possible to determine Scott's actual
believe.)

Wouldn't you say the judge has agency to issue warrents?

I don't think so. I am a pragmatist; we have obviously been playing quite

Actually, the judge's clerk has the agency to issue warrants. :)

I will admit that I have not considered this question.  I would hold
that the Rule in question is absurd, but I suspect you are correct
that, given such a Rule, the Judgement (which is also absurd)
necessarily follows.  Garbage in, garbage out, I suppose.

Part of the problem is that we do not restrict the scope of judicial
inquiry appropriately, I think.  It would be interesting to restrict
judicial inquiry to those matters which involve an actual controversy.
Then statements such as the one above would be inadmissible unless
someone manages to somehow concoct a controversy that involves a
belief.  (It is definitely possible to define "controversy"; the
United States Supreme Court has done so over the court of the past two
hundred years, in the context of interpreting Article III Section 2 of
the Constitution.)

That's silly, Vlad. In the context of the game, 'Vlad' is not ambiguous,
any more than 'Oerjan Johansen' is ambiguous although I'm sure there are
other Norwegians with that name. 'The Rules have agency' is ambiguous.

I share your suspicions, but in the absence of a proof, it remains

That's not - quite - what I've been saying. Strictly speaking, my
objection to the atomic view as a historical view has been this:
according to the atomic view, amendments to a Rule which occur inside
a Proposal, but which never see the light of day because there is
another amendment of the same Rule later in the Proposal, are supposed
to be "too fleeting" or "too transient" to have any legal significance.
Despite this, we have, historically, counted them.

Not if, as in my example, you consider the appropriate context.

That's certainly not what R1011 *says*. It talks about Nomic
Properties, and defines those very differently to the way you define
natural properties. It may be that R1011 is redundant; there's
nothing new about redundant Rules.

But that's beside the point. The existence of VTs is established
only as a matter of law; if the law says they are destroyed, they
are destroyed. They do not go on existing, merely illegally so.

In your example, the context is clear. In your CFJ, the context is 
ambiguous. Discussions taking page on the discussion list don't 
constitute a suitable context; even if they did, I don't think your 
discussion was extensive enough to constitute a suitable context.

Since someone has already nominated for the position, and considering its lack
of official duties, I will go ahead and accept this temporary position.

How did you do this? Surely the Logical Ruleset directly contains
only information about Proposals which passed? What about the
Proposals which failed? Or did you perform some clever calculations
using Proposal Numbers?

Why the exclamation mark? This was the period of the Black Repeals,
right? Is that why this is for a 2 months period, whereas the other 
entries cover only 1 month?

This is by far the shadiest part of the seminar! It's pretty clear that
we're not averaging anything like 9 Proposals a week at the moment, nor
have we for quite some time. When was the last time we had 9 Proposals
in a single distribution?

Let's just look at this year: the first Proposal distributed this
year was Proposal 2781; we're now up to 3554. However, that includes
Crito's 600 scam Proposals. Disregarding them, this year we've voted
on just 173 Proposals in about 40 weeks, an average of about 4.25
Proposals per week, nowhere near 9. This pushes the relative advantage
of Officers to others Players much closer to the 3:2 you think is
appropriate, since income from the VT stipend is really much lower
than you think it is.

On the other hand, I don't think that Officers should have anything like
a 50% advantage in VT income, collectively speaking, over the other
Players, so those effects ttends to cancel each other out somewhat.

In general, I agree with your conclusion that the CotC is not overpaid.
He's certainly been getting a workout recently though!

Like you, I prefer Scott's wording: the Rules require us to act as if
(we believed that) certain things are true. In this case (if we follow
Justice elJefe's Appeal Judgement), the Rules require us to act as if
(we believe that) VTs were destroyed as a result of the adoption of
P3533.

What I can't accept is that VTs have gone on existing in defiance of
the Rules since P3533 destroyed them, which was Scott seemed to be
claiming. I think Oerjan may have convinced him to recant, though.

Fine, then I think Rule 1011 is largely, if not totally, redundant.
It is probably the case that Rule 1011 has no effect at all on natural
properties, in which case Rule 1011 is completely redundant.

The _Currency_ VTs exists as a matter of law.  Whether or not the
individual VTs exist solely as a matter of law is disputable.
