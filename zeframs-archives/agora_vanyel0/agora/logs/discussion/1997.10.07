Calm down, Steve.

It matters not when the Bank mints any VTs, since they'll be in the
Bank at that point anyway, and the only way they can get out is for
the Bank to transfer them to someone else.  The Bank can't do that
except by satisfying Payment Orders, and it won't do that until I have
a chance to review the records and determine what they all are.  And,
since I have a test tomorrow, this won't be before tomorrow evening.

Well, sure, if you're then you're busy, and that's a perfectly good
reason to wait. My point was only that waiting for the Appeal Judgement
to be published is not, in and of itself, a particularly good reason
to wait.

If I have any concern at all, it's that I get an answer to the request
for evidence I sent you before the Appeal of the CFJ 1045 Injunctions
is due, in about 3 days time. But I'm sure you'll get to it before then.

Yes, but Elde is no longer a Player. Thus, not an EiP. We therefore 
must figure out Blob's situation as if e did not have an EiP, and 
given that e is not a terminal estate, there is no reason why e 
should not be eir own Executor now.

R1601:

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.

When Elde (Blob) deregistered, therefore, e was placed in Probate and
became a terminal estate for the purposes of Probate.

R1738:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

Elde (Blob) having been placed in Probate, Morendil (Elde) became eir
Executor in Probate.

R1738:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

Morendil (Elde) was therefore Elde's Executor.

R1478:

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

To be eir Executor, Morendil (Elde) had to be a Player.  E can therefore
act entirely on eir behalf, as R1478 takes precedence over R1738.
(R1738's precedence clause would only fire if R1478 would specify a
different Executor, which it does not.)

Next, Morendil (Elde) acting on behalf of Elde (Blob) reregisters em.
According to R1601, e ceases to be a "terminal estate", but does not
leave Probate.  (An entity leaves Probate only when eir EiP announces
that Probate is complete.)

When Blob's EiP, Elde, deregistered, e ceased to be a Player, and
therefore by R1478 cannot be an Executor.  R1478 still doesn't specify
an Executor for Blob; merely that Elde cannot be it.  Therefore Blob
does not have an Executor.  R1738 says "The Executor in Probate of an
entity is the Executor of that entity", but doesn't establish a reverse
connection, so Elde remains Blob's EiP.

R1478's "Except where the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
Executor." now takes effect, making Blob eir own Executor.  (The Rules do
not stipulate otherwise -- R1738 stipulates that Elde is Blob's Executor,
but R1478 stipulates that this is impossible, and takes precedence.)
As R1478 now specifies an Executor for Blob, R1738's precedence clause
kicks in: it make Blob's EiP, Elde, eir Executor, and limits em to
submitting Transfer Orders.  As the Rules now stipulate otherwise,
R1478's condition becomes false, and it ceases to specify Blob being
eir own Executor.  R1738's precedence clause then drops, R1478 takes
precedence, preventing Elde being an Executor.  This loops.

Under this interpretation, Elde and Blob alternate as Blob's Executor,
each being Executor for an infinitesemal period before changing.
(Try doing *that* with simultenaity!)  Elde can therefore act on behalf
of Blob, but is limited to submitting Transfer Orders, and Blob can also
act as eir own Executor in the normal way.

Another way of interpreting R1738's precedence clause is that it *always*
takes precedence over R1478, not only when they conflict.  TTBOMK this
issue has never been tested in the courts.  If this is the case, then
EiPs cannot act as Executor to reregister ex-Players that are in Probate,
and Elde and Blob were never reanimated.

If R1738 were interpreted such that ceasing to be an Executor would
prevent one being EiP as well, then, with Blob being still in Probate,
and without an EiP, the Notary would now be required to nominate a Player
to be eir EiP.  Interestingly, there would nothing to stop the Notary
nominating Blob to be eir own EiP, as e is still a Player.

By the way, as Elde has now been deregistered, R1601 fires again:

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.

E is "placed in Probate" again, while still in Probate, and is once
again a terminal estate.  However, nothing causes Morendil to cease
being Elde's EiP, so the first paragraph of R1738 does not fire --
Morendil remains eir EiP.

Btw, when a Player is not eir own Executor, e can still act on eir own
behalf, including acting as other entities' Executors on their behalf.
Only Rules that refer specifically to Executors are affected.

Relevant Rules are included below.

-zefram

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1601/1 (Power=1)
Probate

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any units of
      Currency; if an entity which possesses units of Currency would
      otherwise be destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate,
      and its destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of Probate.

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1738/0 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

Oh, right. When checking I misread and thought I saw a CFJ in the 400s,
but it was just the number of the Rule involved.

This was the scam described in the Agora handbook perpetrated by T &
M.  The T was Ronald Kunne (perhaps it was S there for "Stella?").
The M was me. :-)

Were any "votes" actually cast during that period?  OTOH, apparently nobody had
any VTs to be able to cast votes then anyway.  8)

True, but declarations of Presence werre still possible, and might have
occurred.

This is the part of your reasoning I don't follow. Elde's deregistration
makes it impossible for Elde to be Blob's Executor, and R1738 states
that the EiP of an entity is that entity's Executor. Doesn't it follow
that Elde *cannot* be Blob's EiP, contrary to your claim above?

>R1478's "Except where the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own

I agree except for the bit about R1738's stipulation. R1478 makes Blob
eir own Executor, and R1738 therefore makes Blob eir own EiP. So the
Notary need not nominate a new EiP for Blob, since, although e remains
in Probate, e has an EiP - emself.

of Executor--so that a Rule which says, "A cannot be B's

Probate."

I'm afraid I don't understand this part.  If two Rules don't conflict,
it seems to me, to say one has precedence over the other is moot
at best, and possibly meaningless, since both Rules can be
satisfied simultaneously.

Indeed. I (and I think, all of us) explicitly rejected this premise
when we accepted Morendil's original argument that his being appointed
Elde's EiP under R1738, allowed him to act as Elde's Executor under
R1478.

It took me a while, but I've finally figured what I think is going
on here, and I agree with you: Blob is eir own Executor, and eir
own Executor in Probate. Depending on how you look at it, Zombie
Blob has either just woken up, or just fallen asleep. At any rate,
you're no longer pulling eir strings.

This makes it very likely that Blob will soon be deregistered
for Abandoning the Game (has someone actually alleged this already?).
In the meantime, Blob is most definitely in violation of R478 for
not being subscribed to the PF, and there is now nothing you can
do about it.

Let's come at this from a slightly different angle. How should we
Judge this hypothetical CFJ:

CFJ 5555: This Statement is relevant to the Rules.

You can't Judge it FALSE, because then you should dismiss it; you
can't dismiss it, because then you should judge it FALSE; only a
Judgement of TRUE is self-supporting. The challenge then is to say
why CFJ has more relevance to the Rules than either of CFJs 2001
or 2002.

That's true, but it's still correct.  Since R1478 *would* specify a
different Executor, R1738 has precedence over R1478, regardless of whether
they conflict or not.  (this is the same way that R101 has precedence over
R102, even if they do not conflict)

I would dismiss this.

The statement has no relevance to the rules, and is therefore dismissed.
Had I judged it, it would have judged it false, but I'm dismissing it, not
judging it.

Does the Judgement of CFJ 944 show that the VP of P3551 did manage
to conclude, contrary to what we first thought? If so, then the
results for this Proposal are way overdue.

I disagree, albeit not strongly enough to bother with anything as formal
as a Kudo transfer or anything.
