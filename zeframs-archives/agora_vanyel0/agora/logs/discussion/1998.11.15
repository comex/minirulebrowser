If this is intended to garner support for your preferred system, I imagine
it will simply shut down the Probate system instead:  in practice, no one
will get stiffed except the Bank, so who cares?

In other words, let's let someone scam the system first before we

I think the best way to answer to Scott's method of protest is to do
something we should have done some time ago, and that is to generalize
the Without Objection mechanism so that actions can be specified as
performable Without n Objections. I'll work something up  when I get a
moment.

No, let's eliminate the parts of the system that are scammable, (ie POs to
other players) because nobody is using them anyway. Then we won't need 
Probate to act as scam-prevention. I'll proto this soon.

I'm not sure which way around the precedence between this rule and 698
should be. If 698 takes precedence, it might be interpreted that when
all players become ineligible by the new rule, then 698 is used to 
select the next judge, rather than using the above rule to reset the
eligibilities.
