You could mint a Currency and offer to exchange it for VTs at a 10 to
1 ratio, and then charge 1 of that Currency for your service.

How about "A statement that an entity gains some number of Blots at the

1. As a player-controlled currency, people will be loath to
use it.

2. It still requires people to pay a minimum of 1VT.  Fine if
they're going to use the service repeatedly; not fine if they'll
only use it once or a few times.

They could trade off the remaining pieces to other Players for other

I assume in the soon-to-be-published Ruleset that those Proposals
which have been reported as passing since the adoption of VTs have
in fact passed, and will continue to do so unless a CFJ determines
otherwise, or corrected voting results are reported.

Perhaps change the rule so that it no longer specifies that 
"infintesimal amount of time" but instead just has items in proposals
follow immediately after one another. I'm not sure if that's doable.
Oh well.

Indeed, when? Vlad, you and Zefram seem hell-bound on dismantling
our current economic system without bothering to notice the

Hmmm... the Merriam-Webster server contains none of them.  But if the
above are synonyms, it seems to me that "clear as ink" must mean the
opposite of the Norwegian phrase ("klart som blekk"), which actually
means clear and not muddy...

The literal translation of "clear as ink" into Norwegian actually means clear? That confuses me; what would the function of clear ink be?

Draft of a basic Contract Law

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players fails to comply with that agreement, any
      other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.  

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement to make fair
      and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When restitution
      would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge is permitted
      to instead issue whatever Payment Orders are necessary to effect
      restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be awarded with
      respect to the breach of the agreement which would have required
      a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution include the
      issuance of Payment Orders, the payor of which is any entity not
      party to the agreement.  

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.
      
      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not an party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

The Americanism for extremely clear is "crystal clear", I think.
There may be others.

Hey, wait a second. We are hardly the only ones noticing flaws in
the current system. Indeed, I think it can be said that none
of the existing Currencies are working as intended if, even,
they exist. In addition, may previous attempts to form some
sort of economy have failed. I am not claiming that this means
something of the sort is impossible, just that it is not as
straightforward as some seem to think.
  My own position is that it would be much simpler to regulate
access to game actions directly rather than using Currency-like
representations. Then we wouldn't have to worry about fine-
tuning scarcity, or complicated rules for moving them about.
The Players could exchange services directly. As Oerjan suggests,
such a barter system would be more likely to succeed than a
full-blown market economy.

It's quite an interesting idea, but how do these regulated accesses 
change hands? I.e. if Steve is the only one who can propose, or Steve and 
elJefe (say), that's very interesting for a while, but eventually we will 
want this to change. Also, I think the size of our game (i.e. small) 
presents a problem when limiting game actions. For example, either you or 
someone else mentioned before the idea of only certain players being 
allowed to vote; well, in a game of 20 or so people, many of whom rarely 
vote anyway, how interesting is it going to be to limit voting to.. what, 
3 players? 7? Again, it's an interesting idea but has some serious 
practical problems which would need to be addressed...

Here is what I have in mind. This is not a proposal, nor
even a proto.

--------------------------
666. Occupations

An Occupation is a group of one or more game actions. To
perform the actions associated with an Occupation, a 
Player must have that Occupation. The following are the
only Occupations:

Assemblyman: May vote on any Proposals whose Voting Period
has not ended.

Senator: May make Proposals and may Appeal Judgments.

Lawyer: May make Calls for Judgment.

Justice of the Peace: May Judge CFJ's (only Justices of the
Peace are eligible to Judge CFJ's).

Friar: May create and transfer three Indulgences per week to
any Player (except himself/herself)

Huckster: May form Contests and run for Office.

Town Drunk: The Town Drunk is automatically On Hold. (Only 
Town Drunks may go On Hold).

  A Player may have at most two occupations at any time, except the
Speaker, who is allowed three while he/she holds that Office. The
Registrar shall record the Occupations each player has and include
the information in his weekly report. The default Occupations are
Assemblyman and Justice of the Peace.

Changing Occupations:
  A Player may send a request to change Occupations to the Public
Forum. Outstanding requests take effect on the first of each month.
In addition, a Player may change his/her Occupation
freely in the week following the enactment of this Rule by making
a statement to that effect in the Public Forum. In this case a
Player changes his/her Occupation immediately. Unless specified by other
Rules, a Player may change his/her Occupation in no other way.

-------------------------------------------

Well, I think this could be a lot of fun. It would be interesting to 
see if an equilibrium in the number of various Occupations would
be reached, and how long that would take. If there is interest,
I will make a more formal proto.

DIS: Occupations (Was: Australian Elections)

This sounds like it might generate some interesting play.  OTOH, I would like
to see where our Currencies can go before giving up on them so soon.  I'm not
sure this would work well in the current Currency system, lack of the right
kind of currency would inhibit the flow of occupation changes.

Seems like one of the problems with a Nomic is a tendency to jump track before
long term effects can be seen, since new and interesting alternatives keep
cropping up before short term problems have been ironed out (or made into
interesting features 8).

Here is what I have in mind. This is not a proposal, nor
even a proto.

--------------------------
666. Occupations

An Occupation is a group of one or more game actions. To
perform the actions associated with an Occupation, a 
Player must have that Occupation. The following are the
only Occupations:

Assemblyman: May vote on any Proposals whose Voting Period
has not ended.

Senator: May make Proposals and may Appeal Judgments.

Lawyer: May make Calls for Judgment.

Justice of the Peace: May Judge CFJ's (only Justices of the
Peace are eligible to Judge CFJ's).

Friar: May create and transfer three Indulgences per week to
any Player (except himself/herself)

Huckster: May form Contests and run for Office.

Town Drunk: The Town Drunk is automatically On Hold. (Only 
Town Drunks may go On Hold).

  A Player may have at most two occupations at any time, except the
Speaker, who is allowed three while he/she holds that Office. The
Registrar shall record the Occupations each player has and include
the information in his weekly report. The default Occupations are
Assemblyman and Justice of the Peace.

Changing Occupations:
  A Player may send a request to change Occupations to the Public
Forum. Outstanding requests take effect on the first of each month.
In addition, a Player may change his/her Occupation
freely in the week following the enactment of this Rule by making
a statement to that effect in the Public Forum. In this case a
Player changes his/her Occupation immediately. Unless specified by other
Rules, a Player may change his/her Occupation in no other way.

-------------------------------------------

Well, I think this could be a lot of fun. It would be interesting to 
see if an equilibrium in the number of various Occupations would
be reached, and how long that would take. If there is interest,
I will make a more formal proto.

Indeed.  Pragmatic Currencies is only a couple of months old; it's far
too soon to declare the patient dead.  Sure, there are bugs, but
that's to be expected.  I see no reason to believe that the problems
detected so far cannot be readily corrected.
