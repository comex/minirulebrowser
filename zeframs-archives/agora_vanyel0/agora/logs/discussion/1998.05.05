Proto-Proposal
----------------------------------------
More fun with Priority

Amend Rule 1771 to read :

      An Entity may increase or decrease the Priority of a proposal by
      notifying the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of
      P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the
      Priority of the Proposal is changed by one, provided that this
      transfer is not executed for any other purpose. The Priority of
      a Proposal may not be reduced below zero in this manner.

Michael is correct. Scorekeepor Swann, I hereby order you to increase
Michael's Score by 3 points for having voted on more than 3 Proposals
in a week. (Note that this Score Change will not be applied until
after th termination of the Endgame Procedure.)

As Assessor, I find irritating the requirement in R1784 that the
Assessor order a Score change for any Player who votes on more than 3
Proposals in a week, because it requires the Assessor to check multiple
voting messages from a single Player, a tedious process. I therefore
make the following proto:

####
Proto-Proposal
Tweak R1784

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1784 (The Omnibus Scoring Rule) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e
      gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

with text which reads:

      In any week where a Player voted on more than three Proposals
      in a single message, e gains three Points. The Assessor must
      order this Score change.

####

Note that Michael would still have Scored his 3 Points under this Rule,
since although his votes were on Proposals from different batches, they
were all contained in a single message.
