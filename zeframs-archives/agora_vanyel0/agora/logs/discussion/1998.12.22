Steve,
Please detail why your appeal arguments ( though much more grammatical
that my judgement) is otherwise superior to it.  I read the discussion
and agreed without reiterating the points that i agreed with, and you
did the same with Crito's arguments.  If i had named the Players who
made the most persuasive arguments, would that have spared me from the
worst of your criticisms?

To some extent.  8)

Although to be fair to Steve, the exact arguments to which e referred were present within the same posting as eir statement.  And they were official statements in the PF, as well, not just postings to discussion.  If Lee had copied in the text of some of the arguments to which Lee referred in eir judgement, I don't think anyone would have criticized em for it.

In my opinion, Steve's argument is acceptable because the arguments to which
he refers are part of the official record of the CFJ while those to which
Lee refers are not.  Lee's Judgement would be a poor contribution to game
custom.   Sorry Lee but that's the way I see it.

I remind Registrar Andre he is required to conduct an Election for the
Office of Treasuror.

Which raises an interesting question. Assume that my Proposal to make
the Xmas/New Year period a Holiday is adopted, and assume (which seems
reasonable), that the Holiday will then commence (de facto) at the time
the Proposal is adopted. Question: will this affect Players' ability to
nominate in this Election (assuming further that Andre has called for
nominations by then)?

R1769 (Holidays) states that:

     If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given time,
     and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
     twenty-four-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then
     that action need not be done until twenty-four hours after that
     Holiday ends.

I can see arguments for both sides. On the one hand, no-one is required
to nominate in an Election. On the other hand, if one wants to nominate
in an Election, one is required to do so before the end of the
Nominating Period.

Opinions?
