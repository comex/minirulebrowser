Fix *what* correctly? Or get rid of *what*?

The problem as I see it is that more P-Notes are going in than out of
circulation. We could fix that by adjusting P-Note reward in various
Rules - but that really would be tinkering. What I'm proposing is a much
more flexible way of dealing with the problem. The Promotor's power to
turn the Tap on or off will be similar, if cruder, than the Chancellor's
ability to raise or lower the BOS. Are you saying that you think giving
the Chancellor this power was a mistake? I think it's worked out
reasonably well.
