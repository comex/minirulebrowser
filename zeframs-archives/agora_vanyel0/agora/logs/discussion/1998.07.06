I think we used to have a Rule penalizing Judges in the specific
case they they failed to impose penalties that the Rules required them
to impose, but we've never had a general Rule to that effect, and
even the Rule about Judges seems to have disappered from the Ruleset,
probably during PC.

In the absence of anything specific, the case would only be covered
by R1439 (Blots due to a CFJ). If a CFJ alleging that a Player
violated a Rule by failing to impose penalties e was required to
impose was Judged TRUE, that Player would receive a Blot penalty
equal to the Power of the Rule.

An interesting question arises: can the Rules require a Player to do
something the Rules make it legally impossible from em to do?

Do we need a Rule that allows one to use the excuse that e was just
following the Rules?

The ability to decide Elections (thereby getting an extra vote) sounds

I guess.  I'm not very sure about it though.

After giving all my Indulgences away, I discover that I am now in the
parlous state of owing a Blot.  I also have a fair bit of VT cash that
I can't spend on voting, so I'm willing to pay good prices for as many
Indulgences as people are willing to sell.

Please make me an offer, O Indulgence Rich people.

IMHO, Rule 402 takes precedence over Rule 1445 and does deny the
former Speaker the right to cast a deciding Vote. Further, I think
the language in Rule 1445 can only apply to the Player who is
Speakerat the time the Election Results are published. (This rules
out the option of waiting for the end of the Speaker Transition until
a new Speaker is proclaimed.) Thus, Rule 1445, under such particular
conditions, should be taken as *not* specifying any Winner; and the 
Election must be held again.

DIS: Interested in buying Indulgences

I'll make a straight trade of 1 Indulgence for 1 P-Note.

-- Crito

>>> Michael Norrish <Michael.Norrish@cl.cam.ac.uk> 07/06/98 05:49am >>>
After giving all my Indulgences away, I discover that I am now in the
parlous state of owing a Blot.  I also have a fair bit of VT cash that
I can't spend on voting, so I'm willing to pay good prices for as many
Indulgences as people are willing to sell.

Please make me an offer, O Indulgence Rich people.

Michael.

PS: I'm still interested in buying Indulgences, but I don't have any
more P-Notes, so I'll consider offers expressed in VTs.

Hmpfh.  Oh well, I wasn't planning for the P-Note reward anyhow.  (I
somehow missed it completely when I first re-read the Birthday Rule.)

I don't quite understand. R1853 states that:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

It would appear from the above that 149.3 VTs are therefore in
circulation. There are currently 15 Players. Therefore the number
of Voting Tokens per Player should be a fraction under 10, not 8.93
as reported above. What did I miss?

Shouldn't 'Revamp New Player Incentives', as the oldest of the three

DIS: Voting Tokens per Player?

It's possible that I have missed something, but I did not see any definition of
how the calculation of Voting Tokens Per Player should be carried out,
therefore I assumed it to have its natural meaning - the average number of VTs
held per Player.  This means VTs held by Groups are not counted in that
average.  It did not say "Voting Tokens per Entity Other than the Bank".  I'll
take another look at the Rule.

DIS: Re: OFF: The Proposal Queue as of 6 July, 1998

Yes, you are right.  That's why it ended up getting the lowest new Proposal
number.

Shouldn't 'Revamp New Player Incentives', as the oldest of the three
Proposals above, be first in the Queue?

Since the definition of 'in circulation' precisely is the number of
VTs possess by entities other than the Bank, I would have thought that
the natural meaning of "Voting Tokens per Player in circulation" was
"the number of Voting Tokens in circulation divided by the number of
Players". That's certainly what I intended when I wrote the Rule; 
otherwise, Groups and Contests can be used as tax shelters.

At first glance I'd say Steve is right. "In circulation" means "not
owned by the Bank", so the total amount of VTs in circulation is as
he suggests; the Rule then mentions "the number of Voting Tokens per
Player in circulation". This can very probably be considered to mean
the same thing as "the number of Voting Tokens in circulation
divided by the number of Players".

This suggests potentially interesting manipulations of the VTPP
amount by 'hiding' one's VTs in a Group or Contest Treasury...

Only if Crito's method is used. Using my method, it doesn't matter
who owns a VT, you or a Contest. As long as it's not owned by the Bank,
it's in circulation.
