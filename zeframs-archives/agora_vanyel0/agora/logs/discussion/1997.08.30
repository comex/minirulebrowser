When considering this InP you will probably want to know that Ackanomic,
like Agora and probably all Internomic members, does not grant Internomic
any power to change its Rules.

Indeed.  It is my opinion that this particular Proposal is completely
without effect; its first paragraph seeks to restrain the behavior of
entities which are not subject to InterNomic's jurisdiction, and its
latter seeks to change the Rules of Ackanomic, something that, as far
as I know, is beyond the power of an adopted Internomic Proposal.
However, it might be argued that this creates an obligation on the
part of Ackanomic, as a Member Nomic, to change its Rules accordingly,
an argument that I think has merit.

The main effect of this is to deprive Players of Mint Authority; but,
as Mint Authority is no longer required to Mint a Currency, it doesn't
matter. :)
