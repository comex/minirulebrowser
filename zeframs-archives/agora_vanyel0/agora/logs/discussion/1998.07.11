I would not be adverse to regulation which states that a Payment Order
is stayed by operation of law while the Player commanded by that Order
is On Hold.  Rule 1795 may be illuminatory here, as well.

Yes, that is inappropriate.  I would prefer that the time during which
an order is stayed is not counted toward the amount of time before
which the order must be satisfied.  Expressing that in language
acceptable to Agorans is not simple, however.
