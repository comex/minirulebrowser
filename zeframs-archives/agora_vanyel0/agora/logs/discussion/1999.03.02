I don't think we should repeal Power of Attorney, and I'm not just
saying that because I happen to be the only Player holding a PoA at
present. I think PoA is a genuinely interesting concept, and working out
its implications will periodically provide us with interesting topics of
conversation.

What have you got against it, Scott?

Heh - that's certainly one of the more ingenious arguments we've heard
here for voting for a Proposal.

H. Assessor Blob,

I hereby vote for Proposals 3437 and 3438.

Vlad, I remind you that in order to qualify for the Degree (assuming
that P3438 passes), you will have to repost both parts of your
Prolegomena with an explicit indication that they are being submitted
with the intention of qualifying for the Degree of Doctor of Nomic
History. See R1370.

I am about to distribute the Appeal of the Judgement, so I think
retaining the stays is appropriate.

TIA violation or not, it's the funniest thing I've read on this list in
a very long time. Kudos to you, Vlad. (Herald Crito, are you listening?)

It's odd, though, while I was reading it, I got the *strangest* feeling
that I was being *needled*. Now, how could that be?

Never mind, satire is the sincerest form of...something or other.

I *thought* there was something wrong with those numbers! They're 400
behind! Luckily my votes were only sent to a-d.

H. Promotor G. Chaos, you have yet to assign any legal numbers to the
above Proposals.

On a historical note, the original (rather I should say, 'actual')
Proposals 3437-3439 were among the 600 identical Proposals submitted by
Crito as part of scam and distributed by elJefe on Mar 12, 1997, nearly
two years ago. Each had the text:

    This is a disinterested proposal.  This is specificaly intended to
    be a separate, duplicate proposal of any prior proposal with the
    same text.  Crito is declared the winner.

The scam exploited a Rule which stated that any Player who submitted 3
consecutive Proposals which received exactly the same distribution of
votes for and against (eg, each getting one vote for and three against),
won the game. At the time, winners were rewarded with 10 Voting Tokens
Crito won about 590 times with this scam, and was rewarded with a
spectacular number of VTs (or was it EVs back then?).

I have made no such claim. I was unable to return a decision on
Chaos' Motions, because I am required to do so within 5 days of them
being sent to me, and since I returned a late Judgement, that was not 
possible.

It was VTs.  The scam worked because this was the beginning of the VT
economy where we had just made it impossible to vote without VTs so
there was only a limited number of votes that could possibly be cast.  And
I made enough proposals so that at least three consecutive 0-0-0 votes
would result unless all Players spent almost all their votes in a very careful way.
(I had intended to make it absolutely impossible, but that would have
required a much larger number of proposals and that would have put
too much of a strain on the poor Promotor, elJefe).

It's posted with the Notary's report.  But, in essence, the will specifies distribution
to the unemployed and new Players (< month?) at the time of deregistration.

To be precisely, on Tuesday 9 February I issued the following Will:

My assets are to be divided as evenly as possible among all players who either
received unemployment benefits or registered during the current month.

I think you forgot the word 'not' somewhere in the part after 'and'.

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 6]

Simplify Probate

Be it resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

|     (a) An entity is disempowered if it does not have an Executor.

|     (b) The Notary is permitted and authorized to perform any of the
|         following with respect to a disempowered entity:
|       (1) transfer Currencies owned by the disempowered entity for
|           the purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the
|           disempowered entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
|           disempowered entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

|     (c) A disempowered entity is considered to continue to have
|         legal existence as long as it continues to possess units of
|         Currency or is named as the payor or payee of a Payment
|         Order, even if it would otherwise be dissolved or destroyed,
|         or otherwise cease to have legal existence, prior to that
|         time.

|     (d) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would impair
|         the Notary in the exercise of the powers granted in
|         subdivision (b) of this Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos236 [rev. 1]

Motions, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rules 789, 1500, 1564, 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1868
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
          decide any question regarding:
        (1) the correctness or legality of the Judgement entered by a
            Judge in a Call for Judgement;
        (2) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of any
            Judicial Order;
        (3) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of the grant
            or denial of any Judicial Motion; or
        (4) any allegation that a Judge has failed to properly perform
            eir duties as a Judge.

      (b) A question shall be certified to the Court of Appeals by the
          Clerk of the Courts when any of the following hold:
        (1) any three Players have requested, in the Public Forum,
            that the question be certified;
        (2) the question involves the issuance of an Order binding
            some Player and that Player has requested, in the Public
            Forum, it be certified; or
        (3) the question involves the correctness of a Judgement
            convicting a Player of a Crime and that Player has
            requested, in the Public Forum, it be certified.

      (c) When a question is certified to the Court of Appeals, the
          Court shall immediately convene and collectively decide the
          question, either in the affirmative or the negative, and
          upon reaching a decision the Court shall inform the Clerk of
          the Courts of its decision and the reasons therefore.

      (d) The Court of Appeals shall also have the power to execute
          such Appellate Orders as may be necessary to enforce its
          determination, subject to the limitations established in the
          Rules upon Appellate Orders.

      (e) The Clerk of the Courts is directed to establish a system of
          nomenclature for certified questions so as to permit easy
          and unambiguous reference to them.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to a Court. 
          This may be either a Common Court or the Court of Appeals.

      (b) A Motion is filed by submitting it to the Clerk of the
          Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ or certified question to
          which the Motion applies, and setting forth the action
          requested.

      (c) The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed
          Motion to the Court in question as soon as possible after
          receiving it.

      (d) Within five days (unless the Court defers ruling on the
          motion) the Court shall rule on the Motion, either granting
          or denying it.  If a Court fails to rule or defer ruling on
          a Motion within the time alloted by this subdivision, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (e) A Court may defer ruling on a Motion by informing the Clerk
          of the Courts that it is doing so, in which case it must
          either grant or deny the Motion not later than it issues a
          decision on the CFJ or certified question with which the
          Motion is associated.  A Court may not defer ruling on a
          Motion made after decision has been granted.  If the Court
          fails to rule on a deferred Motion by the time it issues a
          decision on the related CFJ or certified question, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (f) The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
          Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Court
          to perform as requested by the Motion.  A Motion requesting
          a Judicial Order, if granted, requires that Court to execute
          the Order requested.

      (g) A Court rules on a motion by filing its ruling of grant or
          denial with the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons
          it chooses to state.

      (h) Upon receipt of a Court's ruling on a Motion, the Clerk
          shall note the ruling made and the reasons, if any, on the
          record of the CFJ or certified question, and shall notify
          the Player who made the Motion of the ruling.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) Whenever a Call for Judgement is received by the Clerk of
          the Courts, the Clerk shall convene a new Common Court to
          hear that CFJ, and shall assign a Player to act as the Judge
          of that Court.

      (b) If the Player assigned as the Judge of a Court ceases to be
          eligible to act as the Judge in that Court, and any CFJ
          assigned to that Court is not fully resolved, the Clerk of
          the Courts shall assign a new Player to act as the Judge of
          that Court.

      (c) Once a CFJ is assigned to a Common Court, it shall remain
          assigned to that Court, unless transferred to another Court
          by an Order of Transfer.

      (d) The selection of Players to act as the Judge of a Common
          Court shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
          to serve as the Judge of that Court.

      (e) Once assigned as the Judge of a Court, that Player remains
          the Judge of that Court until e is recused as Judge of that
          Court, or e ceases to be a Player.

      (f) A CFJ is fully resolved if:
        (1) it has been either judged or dismissed and such judgement
            or dismissal has not been vacated; and
        (2) every filed Motion which applies to that CFJ has been
            either granted or denied.

The VTCL is the _maximum_ average player holding. The actual average 
may be much smaller. Why should new players be given so many VTs?

I thought you meant that proposal numbers should henceforth be issued
in decreasing order. :)

ProtoProposal Chuck121.2
Power to the Rulekeepor

Rule 947 is amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal, if, in the Rulekeepor's estimation, the Proposal
      simplifies the Ruleset.  If the Rulekeepor decides that the
      Proposal does not simplify the Ruleset, e must announce this
      decision.

      When the Rulekeepor decides that such a Proposal does not
      simplify the Ruleset, the Executor of the Proposal's Proposer
      may reverse the Rulekeepor's decision Without Three Objections,
      provided the procedure for doing so is initiated within one
      week of the announcement of the Rulekeepor's decision.  When
      the Rulekeepor's decision is reversed in this manner, the
      Executor of the Proposal's Proposer shall pay out 1 P-Note
      to the Proposal's Proposer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Comment: now that P3836 has passed, this should work.  Prior to
that, it was questionable whether the W3O clause would be effective.

It is the Rulekeepor's opinion that this Proposal will not be
effective if adopted, because the attempted amendment is ambiguous.
