Looks better than anything I've written on the issue, in fact :-)

I would like to point out that the major motivation for my view 
(especially now that the result of this CFJ doesn't matter for 
P<whatever>) is that the language used in Rule 1766 did, in fact, say 
"that Player".

Feel free. Since this didn't generate a game-state split, the result 
isn't urgent. I would appreciate a good judgement from you, as a 
judge, that will be the same as your judgement on Appeal. [Preferably 
my view :-)] If you have done your pondering and still can't decide, 
do what I do: flip a coin, then ignore the coin flip if you don't 
like it. [Whatever works.]

Would replacing 'a maximum of' with 'no more than' work? You're 
right that the translation is incorrect. I didn't notice that - 
perhaps I'd be more observant if I were more awake :-)

I think that that's an arbitrary level of generality. We could be a 
bit less general: Crito can cast a maximum of 4 Votes. Or we could be 
more general: Crito can cast a maximum of aleph-null votes. The 
difference is that, in being less general, we assume that Crito does 
not become Speaker; in being more general, we relax the assumption 
that the rules do not change. How do we determine which level of 
generality is valid? Alternately, what time frame are we considering?

The two solutions to this, from a logical point of view, are to make 
'maximum' as general as possible, or as specific as possible. If we 
make 'maximum' as general as possible (and thus, extend it infinitely 
into the future), we get aleph-null - not a useful answer. If we make 
'maximum' as specific as possible (restricting it to the present), we 
get the current value. Thus, the maximum number of votes Crito may 
make is the maximum number of votes Crito may currently make: the 
greatest number of votes Crito could legally cast in the current 
situation and under the current rules. If we specify a specific 
proposal, then 'maximum' becomes even more specific: the greatest 
number of votes Crito could legally cast on that proposal in the 
current situation and under the current rules.

On the other hand, the use of 'maximum' is well-defined, so we are 
following an unambigous chain to an surprising conclusion. Analogous 
to "the means justify the end".

I think that your usage is fairly "fuzzy", however, and is 
following an ambigous chain to the expected conclusion. Analogous to 
"the end justifies the means".

Strained? I read rule 1766 (the first time I read that rule, BTW), 
and that was the interpretation that seemed obvious. I was, I admit, 
definitely hoping to find a problem with the rule; but you are, by 
the same token, hoping to find no problem with the rule, and I 
consider *your* interpretation strained. Which just shows that logic 
is in the eye of the beholder, doesn't it? :-)

When did admitting the author's intent guide rule-readings in Agora? 
I am sure it must cut down on the number of rule-crisises. ;-|

I hope I don't sound that silly when I make my arguements. 
[Unfortunately, I know I do. I've read some of my arguments from past 
debates - whether or not I'm right, I manage to justify my arguments 
in stupid ways.] 
Disclaimer: That last remark is *competely* my opinion, and I am not 
suggesting that anyone else should find Steve's remark silly. I am 
claiming that I find Steve's use of consequence in justifying an 
argument irregular in this environment, but not that it is 
neccessarily false for being irregular.

The point of the appeals board is that, unlike a normal CFJ, the 
member selection is consistent. Barring one member could lead to a 
decision not consistent with what the normal Board of Appeals would 
rule. I chose not to have that situation.

For the record, I chose not to bar you mainly because you are one of 
the more politically active Threat members, and also the Speaker, and 
thus you are under a more pressing obligation to remove political 
considerations from your judgements. And yes, now that you mention 
it, I *am* curious to see what you do, but that wasn't why I didn't 
bar you.

Yes. This is a game, and when you enter into a game with other players,
you implicitly agree to abide by the rules. Not doing so is cheating, 
and is right to be frowned upon.

Repeal "Discourages Too Many Proposals"

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 1065 ("Discourages Too Many Proposals") is repealed.

[Comment: With the Proposal Queue, there's no benefit to
submitting lots of Proposals, and I think we can trust
people not to make unnecessary work for the Promotor.]

Agora operates on the presumption that Players always do their best to
follow the Rules.

I can think of a few cheats that would be impossible to discover:

The Vote Collector cheating at secret Voting (which we currently don't have)
An Officer cheating at a random selection
Falsifying Date: headers

The basic idea is that by accepting (and thus, by the spirit of the game,
encouraging) cheating we would need to remove certain useful features from
the game entirely, or make them considerably more awkward.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

While I see your point, Chuck, I'm not sure whether this rule is
only meant to slow down overeager players from submitting too many
serious proposals, but also to avoid scams that involve, say, hundreds
of proposals at a time.

Although this would water down your idea, maybe one could raise the
allowed number of submissions per week to, say, 10 proposals, but then
have much higher penalty for excess ones.

Why are you asking? I'm just curious; a problem I noticed about this
rule is a kind of typo (a missing ">" delimiter after "<proposal
number" in the text of the rule. If this isn't covered by our typo
rule (I'd tend to say it isn't) then the proposal number cannot
successfully inserted into the monument rule. And your question may be
whether, the proposal number replacement failing, the time replacement
will succeed or not.

I didn't think about consistency with other rules or general concepts,
but in this particular case my expectation was that the replacement of
"<time>" with the time of the win works, while that of the proposal
number doesn't - I guess that would make it two separate provisions.

Thank you.

This argument I can accept. It is not based on vague interpretation of
Rules, on 'game custom', nor on definitions of logical premise. It is
based on fact as contained in our ruleset. 

For your sound reply to this COE I hereby transfer one Kudo to you. This
Kudo will come from G.Chaos for eir unwillingness to accept that another
individual may apply logical thought processes in a different manner to
emself.

Yes, I know this is in addition to Blob's Kudo transfer. But, this Kudo
transfer is in relation to eir reply to Blob's message. As quoted here;

Essentially, I do claim that your premise is invalid; i.e. that the
quantity referred to by "the maximum number of votes that are
permitted to be cast by that Player" might not be the five-Vote
limit, given that Rule 206 itself does not make a sufficient 
distinction between the two-Vote and the five-Vote limits.

I entirely agree with you here - but have you reflected that, if not 
for Rule 206, that is exactly what it would say ? Let's suppose that 
Rule 206 is absent, and a Rule says "This Rule increases by two the 
number of Votes that can be cast by a Player. This shall not increase 
the number of Votes that that Player can cast". Does that make sense 
to you ?

You argument, it seems to me, is only valid if we assume that this
provision in Rule 1766 refers to a limit that results from applying
the provisions of Rule 206. But then we run into the problem of which
of the two limits specified by Rule 206 (which does *not* use the
word 'maximum') is referred to.

It is at this point that the difference between 'a Player' and 'that 
Player' may become significant, though I'm still waiting to make up 
my mind.

Unless the actual wording of that selfsame Rule grants credence to 
the nonsensical interpretation, which is what Antimatter argues it 
does.

I am starting to lean toward this view. Except that I don't yet see
it as a foregone conclusion that if the difference is significant,
it has to have the effect that Antimatter claims.

OK, I think we have something important here. You seem to have missed 
a point that I make later on in the same post; namely, that whenever 
we have two provisions saying 'X may cast a maximum of N Votes',
and both apply concurrently, we interpret that as limiting X to the 
lower of the two numbers involved. I stand by my rephrasing of Rule 
206's provisions, I'll be coming back to that.

But let me rephrase 206 again, differently. It states

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

The *intended meaning* of this is as follows :

      This Rule grants a basic Voting privilege of two Votes to all 
      Voting Entities; other Rules may grant to particular Voting 
      Entities, or sets of Voting Entities, additional Voting 
      privileges, but in no case shall this exceed a maximum of
      five Votes.

OK so far ? Now, with this wording, I agree that 1766 and 1660,
while still being redundant as far as our contentious provision goes,
could have been interpreted as you suggest much more easily.

However, that's not what Rule 206 actually *says*. It does, IMHO, 
specify two distinct maxima, both of which concurrently apply to any 
Entity in the general case, but one of which can be modified by 
another Rule; you seem to disagree with this conclusion, but I cannot 
see how you rebut it.

You state, of my translation :

> Or at any rate, it would have the consequence that, say, all
> Champions have the right to cast 5 votes on Proposals, since your
> versions say that they can, even if another Rule, eg R1465, say
> otherwise, namely that they can only cast 3. But that can be fixed
> by changing the second 'otherwise' to read 'that e can cast more
> than 5'.

I don't see how this is the case. If we take my hypothetical rephrased 
206 :

   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of two votes on a
   Proposal, unless another Rule states otherwise.
   Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal,
   even if another Rule states otherwise.

And the current 1465 :

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has not
      yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on any
      Proposal.

We clearly find that the first provision of 206' does not apply,
since another Rule does specify otherwise. We are left with two
clauses that do apply, one from 206, stating that a Champion may
cast up to three Votes, and one from 1465, stating that a Champion 
may cast up to five Votes.

My claim - my theoretical point, if you will - is that there is no 
conflict between those two provisions; they are both applied, and 
their combined effect is that a Champion may cast up to the lesser of 
three and five, which is three, Votes.

Now, the reason I offer this rather peculiar manner of interpreting 
Rule 206 is what happens in the general case - that is, when Rule 206 
is the only relevant Rule in determining how many Votes a Voting 
Entity can cast.

The first provision in 206 states : 

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise.

Since there are no other Rules claiming otherwise, this might as well
read :

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal.

But what does this actually *mean* ? Obviously, we have interpreted
this as having the effect that a VE can cast zero, one, or two Votes 
on a Proposal. Thus, the above provision is equivalent to

      Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of two votes on a Proposal.
      Each Voting Entity may cast up to two votes on a Proposal.
      No Voting Entity can cast more than two votes on a Proposal.

Or any number of alternative wordings. Similarly, the second 
provision, since there are, again, no Rules claiming to dictate a 
different restriction, can be considered equivalent to any of the 
following :

      Each Voting Entity may cast a maximum of five votes on a Proposal.
      Each Voting Entity may cast up to five votes on a Proposal.
      No Voting Entity can cast more than five votes on a Proposal.

At this point, if you still feel I'm making a mistake somewhere, 
feel free to point it out.

Otherwise, I think you can see how I come to the conclusion that
Rule 206 itself does specify two distinct 'limits' which are exactly
of the same nature, and that the only way of reconciling that fact 
with Game Custom is to assume that the lower of the two applies.

If you grant that, you'll also grant that I cannot accept your
argument that the provisions in 1660 and 1766 'sensibly' refer to
the second limit in a natural way; and therefore, that we must invoke 
a different explanation of why 1660 works, and apply the same 
principle to 1766 to find out whether it works or not.

On a completely different, but related, note:

   Is there any reason that you don't include the name of the person

A few different reasons : my mailer sets the attribution string to
be the real name of the person (read 'the name attached to the email
address') and I find it somewhat rude not to refer to Agoran Players
by their Agora nickname, and I'm usually too lazy or pressed for time
to go back and edit the attribution line manually to reflect that.

You can only Delegate if you hold an Office in the normal fashion.
Holding an Office by Delegation is not holding it in the normal

If it's not held in normal fashion, doesn't it force an election?

I must admit, I did not see this as the structure of your argument, probably
because I would never have expected it from you.  To give a privilege in one
part of the rule and then (mistakenly) take it away in another part of the rule
may not be desireable, but it is neither illogical or nonsensical in the strict
sense of those terms - it makes the Rule self-contradictory but does not render
it paradoxical or without meaning.

I did not think you were arguing that there is no distinction in the literal
meaning between "a Player" and "that Player".  Indeed you seem to be arguing
that there is a distinction, but you can ignore it because ignoring it makes
the Rule more sensible.  Ignoring the distinction between "Adoption Index" and
"Adoption Ratio" would have made the Impeachment Rule more sensible too, but
that doesn't justify ignoring it and indeed we didn't.

Q1: "What is the maximum number of votes that a Player may cast?"
Q2: "What is the maximum number of votes that Player X may cast?"
Q3: "What is the maximum number of votes that Player X may cast on Proposal Y?"

It is possible to answer "5" to all of the above questions, in the sense that
Steve espouses.  But it is also more accurate to answer each of the above
questions by giving all the possible values depending on circumstances.  I
think both answers sound equally plausible for the first question, but I think
the more descriptive answer is much more plausible for the third.  I don't
think I agree that we can go ahead and choose the least plausible answer for an
interpretation just because it removes a self-contradiction from a Rule.

With Q1 it seems clear that the answer "5" makes the most sense and would be
the preferred interpretation in our case.

With Q3 it seems clear that the more specific answer makes the most sense and
then I would argue that it is this answer that must be used in interpreting the
Rule, resulting in self-contradiction.

Unfortunately, what we actually have is Q2, and which answer makes the most
sense is unclear to me.  I lean toward the more specific since the Player is
specific, but I'm honestly not sure that both answers are not equally
plausible.  I welcome an argument that can convince me of their equality or
disparity.  But to be convincing for me, this argument should be self-contained
and not refer to the Rule in question.  If the most plausible answer makes the
Rule self-contradictory, then so be it.  Only if there is no other way to
distinguish which is the "more correct" answer should we select the one that
gives a more desireable result.

This came up for me once and resignation was suggested.  Scott is right,
though, that this makes something unclear.  The delegation Rule says that at
the end of the period the Delegating Officer resumes holding the Office and
that the Delegated Player ceases to hold it.  But it doesn't say what happens
to the Player who took over after the resignation of the Delegated Player.  But
since the Rules do say that an Office can only be held by one Player at a time,
it seems that the Rules would automatically force the third possible Player out
of Office when the delegation period expires.

Actually, I had forgotten about that--I was thinking more about the
time being ambiguous, as there's no one standard for representing
the time.  If both are ambiguous--which now seems likely--there's
less of a problem.

That's backwards reasoning.  *You* believe that one should succeed, but
not the other--therefore, by R594, they have to be two severable
provisions for that to happen.

Such as?  I don't know of any such scam which is possible
mow, nor of any that are likely to become possible in the
near future.  If the Proposal system is changed such that
submitting a large number of Proposals could lead to benefit
for the proposer, than a Rule like this one should be included
with the Proposal reform.  But I'm not interested in preventing
theoretical scams that could happen with a different Ruleset.

I certainly hope not; it would take the Assessor a very long time to

The result of the CFJ matters very much. If it is Judged TRUE, and
and CFJ 1088 is also Judged TRUE, then the votes on P3710 will
have been 13 FOR, 14 AGAINST.

Yes it is. The Clerk hasn't yet distributed what will be CFJ 1088,
called by Morendil, but it deals with this question.

That's weird, I triple checked the Proposal for typos and I could
have sworn that no such typo existed in the text of the Rule as
it was submitted. Blob, do you have a copy of the message in which
Swann submitted the Proposal to you? Does the typo appear in that
message?

There is minor nit in the Delegation Rule on this point. R1645 sets
out pretty clear conditions on when an Office is legally said to be
Delegated, and all of those conditions will still be true if Sherlock
resigns or goes On Hold. So I'd say that the conclusion to draw is
that the Office will still be Delegated even if Sherlock resigns or
goes On Hold. Surprising, but there it is. So, an Election won't be
triggerred.

If Sherlock goes On Hold, then R1555 says the Speaker holds the
Office. An interesting question is what happens at the end of
the Period of Delegation. Does Michael get the Office back or not?

If Sherlock resigns and appoints Michael as his successor, then
Michael will hold the Office. In fact, he'll hold it in the normal
fashion, since he will have been elected to it and neither retired
nor removed from it.

Really?! Seems to me the most of our scam preventing Rules are
there precisely to prevent theoretical scams that could only happen
with a different Ruleset. And *of course* you don't know of any
Proposal scams - if you did, you'd probably be executing them!
We don't know what the Ruleset will look like in the future, which
is why it's wise to take precautions in advance.

May it be a similar bug as one I recall on yoyo, that the bounce
explanation and the bounced message got split?

What does the bounce say?

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Since your new rephrasing of R206 captures what I think is not only
the intended meaning of the Rule, but it's actual meaning (ie, I
claim that this is how the Rule has long been interpreted), the
course of my rebuttal should be clear: I disagree that R206 specifies
two distinct maxima, in the sense which that word has in the Rules.
Only the second limit, the 'regardless of other Rules' limit, is
properly regarded as a maximum. The reasons for this are partly
conceptual ('maximum' is a strong word, and better fits the idea of
limit regardless of other Rules), but mostly to do with game custom.
Since we have a clear tradition of interpreting 'maximum' in R1660 as
applying to the five vote limit, we should treat it similarly in R1766.

It would appear that the silas name servers are having trouble:  They have
dropped the records for your mail server.

The records are still _here_ locally, so hopefully this CC: to postmaster
will get there.

My wrist has cleared up, and I am in the process of acquiring hardware 
to stop it from happening again, so I would like to come back to the job.
Unfortunately, I notice that Rule 1645 does not provide any means of 
ending the period of Delegation early.

Do I have to wait two weeks to get my Promotorship back, or is there 
another way?

Do you think the Rule should be amended to allow this? It's easily done.

Convince Crito to resign the Office, naming you as successor.

Right. My suspicions are confirmed. The typo was *not* in the text of
the Proposal Swann submitted, nor does it appear in the text of the
Proposal as you distributed it on March 4 (I just checked). It seems
to make its first appearance in the text of the Assessor's Report of
the results, which makes it, I'm pretty sure, simply a mistake on the
part of the Assessor with no legal consequences.

The discussion can now return to the trickier question of whether this
part of the Proposal is one provision or two.

I could do that, but it might just as well be you as me. The real
problem is that 'DR&P' wasd just a patch. The Officer Rules are in
need of a significant conceptual overhaul along the lines sketched by
Oerjan: we need to define the concept of an Electee, a person who has
been Elected to an Office and has not resigned or been retired or
removed from it, but who might not for reasons of Delegation (or
possibly other reasons) be actually holding the Office just at the
moment. That's the easy part. The hard part is then rewriting all the
different Rules which talk about Officers in terms of Electees.
That'll be quite of lot of fairly tricky work.

Yes, I do. I don't think I'm likely to get around to making the

Correct.  The inclusion of the text of adopted Proposals in the
Assessor's Report is merely a courtesy.  I confess to not knowing how
that error crept in, as it appears in my saved copies of the Proposal
texts, but _not_ in my separate list archive.
