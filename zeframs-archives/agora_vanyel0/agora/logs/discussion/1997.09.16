Yes, an examination of the other Rules on voting does seem to bear
you out on this.

It might seem as though in the circumstances, the natural thing for
the Promotor to do would be to delay distributing any more Proposals
(eg the Public Voting Experiment I just submitted) until R693 is
disinfected in two weeks' time. Unfortunately, the fact that Voting
Periods can no longer commence does not relieve the Promotor of the
completely separate duty imposed by R1036 to distribute Proposals
as soon as possible. On the other hand, I wouldn't be seeking to
impose any penalties on the Promotor if he did decide to violate
R1036 and delay the distribution until it could do some good.

I deliberately left this question unanswered in my R&A.

I apologize for not providing a longer R&A; although I do agree
with Morendil's arguments, there were a few points I would have liked
to elaborate on, but my deadline was coming up pretty quick.  So
I'll elaborate now.

I found Morendil's arguments persuasive that an actual *order*
was required--the only thing I really wasn't sure about was if
something claiming to be a payment order, but not containing
a command, would satisfy the requirement as Morendil claimed in
his arguments.  After examining R1596, I finally decided that it probably
would, but I wasn't quite sure.  But it doesn't affect the
actual judgement.

However, if "A payment order is issued from A to the Bank for X
Indulgences" is equivalent to "A is commanded to pay X Indulgences
to the Bank," then it's possible that "A receives X Blots" is
also equivalent to those.  I'm not sure.

On this point I agree with Scott.

Actually, I should add a provision for selling Plots to the Bank.

No, it's not.  A Guillotine can only be executed with respect to a
Proposal if that Proposal's Voting Period is in progress.  And while
the Rule for Emergency Proposals specifies the length of the Voting
Period, it does not specify when that Voting Period commences.  There
is presently nothing that specifies when the Voting Period for any
Proposal is to commence.  I remain unconvinced that Proposal 3551 even
has a Voting Period.  It may be entirely proper for me to disregard
Proposal 3551 entirely, since my Assessorial duties with regard to a
Proposal only commence with the Voting Period of the Proposal.

I suppose a CFJ is in order.

I am still contemplating what will happen with these Proposals when
Rule 693 is disinfected, in light of my prior comments on
retroactivity.  A Proposal distributed less than ten days prior to
Rule 693's disinfection might properly receive an abbreviated Voting
Period.  I'm thoroughly uncertain on this.

I don't much care for such mechanisms.  I'd rather see something like
my old Taxes proposal implemented instead, and salaries substantially
diminished.  Then if an Officer gets greedy, he gets axed.

By way of clarification, perhaps you and Morendil could answer this
question: does the Judgement of CFJ 940 imply that Payment Orders
must use words like 'command', 'order', or some other *explicitly* 
imperative construction in order to be effective? I hope not; I find 
this an absurd and unwarranted conclusion to draw from the wording of 
R1596, as absurd as someone who refuses to honour an invoice sent to them
on the grounds that nowhere on the invoice is it written that they are
commanded to pay the amount the invoice specifies. The point of the
invoice is that *is* a command to pay: sending an invoice is the
implicit issuing of a command to pay the amount specified in the
invoice. It doesn't have to be written on the invoice that you are
commanded to pay some money to someone.

R1596 says that "A Payment Order is an order...", but I read this just
as if it said "A Payment Order is an invoice..."

If the Australian election thing is accepted, your proposals will go
through easier, as it will be more costly to opposa them: Opponents
will have to either pay a VT to vote against, or abstain and be
penalized for it. 

If it is not accepted, you will have more options for your voting
behavior, including a cheap (0 VT cost) way to support proposals (be
present) or to oppose them (don't vote and hope they fail quorum.

>>
My idea is to encourage spending of VTs by enshrining in legislation
a kind of Restore Game Balance manoeuvre, to be performed, say, every
two months, perhaps only if certain conditions on VTs in circulation
are met.
<<

But this RGB is a rather artificial thing, don't you think? It would
be very much an ad hoc fix, and it would introduce an artificial time
rhythm into the game, with spending sprees before the RGB cut and
other end-of-budget-year effects known from RL.

It would be more challenging to try and balance the amount of VTs
entering and leaving circulation by other means, like taxes. You could
even fix the overall number of VTs in circulation once and for all,
say to 5 times the number of players. This works for indulgences now,
and these are the only currency that inspires a considerable amount of
dealing at the moment.

I. Question on currencies: Who is their mintor? What is The Mint?


II. New players

>>
     Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
     pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes,
     5 Mules, and 20 units of Energy.
<<

Ok, so assume that I am a new player, and I get this and nothing
else. Have you checked that this is enough to get me started without
too much outside help? How long does it take for me to get a constant
supply of some resources, so I have VTs and P-notes free for voting
and proposing, not for buying structures and the like?

If you have checked this, I would like to see an example spelled out
explicitly: what to buy in the X-th week of playing, and what comes
out of that.

Similarly, I'd like to see an explicit example of a setup that would
make a player's economy self-sustained, even if it is on a low level
of income.


III. Winning

>>
     Owning at least half of all Plots is a Winning Condition known as
     a Win by Ownership.
<<

This will never happen, right? So why do we need this rule?


IV. Test run

I am still reluctant about turning Agora into a MUD. But I must admit
that I like the general scheme, and it looks like a lot of fun. Have
you ever thought about a test run, say in the context of a contest? I
would join that much more easily than go for a full blown, untested
Agoraverse implementation in the main game. I would even pay a regular
fee to be allowd to participate.

Make that 'Harlequin, Blob and Antimatte become Authors of each Rule
created or amended in a non-cosmetic way by this Proposal.' As you
write it now, the Authorship does not change, only that which the
Rulekeepor must list, resulting in:
1. Forcing the Rulekeepor to publish falsities
2. The names are removed again from the Author list after one publication.

Is that supposed to mean that Harlequin, Blob and Antimatter *are* the
Authors of each such Rule, or that the Rulekeepor should list them as
such in contravention of the facts?

Like the Tax on Marks?  Excuse me if I remain cynical.

I think a greater concern is the lack of Voting.  If people started
habitually Voting again, we'd get more Proposals, and more things
happening.  It's obviously going to be necessary to make Voting cheaper.

I don't quite see that - or do you suggest that we've had few

I don't agree. Making it even cheaper would be equivalent to making it
free, so we could just as well skip all the VT hassle. 

Maybe some incentives to use VTs rather than letting them lie around
would help? Like a strngly nonlinear tax on VTs?

Yes.  I don't know quite how the timing of the disinfection interacted
with me taking my week off, etc, but I'm sure it's all clear now for
Swann to be held a late Judge etc.

Looking back, I think Swann became ineligible by going On Hold. I don't
think any infection or disinfection had anything to do with it.

Yes.  Most Proposals now fail Quorum, so there's no point in bothering
to Propose anything.

I would actually support any moves in that direction, up to the complete
abolition of all Currencies.  We have never succeeded in creating a

No problem. I think I'll just do the best I can:

A prospect to which I would not object.  However, I wouldn't mind having
a reasonable economy; what I really object to is the recycling of ideas
that have previously been tried and found wanting.

Well, I would rather not disobey the Rules, even for a good cause.  Besides, it
doesn't really hurt to distribute proposals sent to me at this point - it just
makes it kind of pointless for the next two weeks.  Once the Rule is
disinfected, then I assume it establishes the Voting Period to be 10 days from
the distribution.  Depending on when it was distributed, that would make the
Voting period either very short, or already ended.  So just re-propose.

Right.  This is what I see as the problem too.  The Rules do establish a kind
of equivalency here.  The way the Infractions were reported it goes like this:

X gains 3 Blots = X gains a payment order for 3 Indulgences payable to the Bank
                = X gains a command to pay 3 Indulgences to the Bank

There is a subtle difference between this and "A is commanded to pay etc.",
however.  In this last formulation, there is a natural assumption that the
sender of the message is the one issuing the command (although it is still
somewhat ambiguous).  The "X gains" forumlation leaves the question of who
issued the command totally unresolved (although it can, of course, be inferred
from the Rules).  Is this enough to prevent "X gains 3 Blots" from being
considered a valid PO?  I'm not sure either.

Not if the PO explicitly states that it is a PO.  For example, I
would consider all of the following to be valid:

Joe is commanded to pay 3 VTs to Bob.

A Payment Order is hereby issued, for 2 P-Notes from Bill to Mary.

Payment Orders:
>From   To     Amount
------ ------ ------
Jeff   Bank   1 VT
Bank   John   2 VTs


I would not consider the following a valid PO:

3 P-Notes from the Bank to Edna (R1997).


The following is a borderline case which I'm not sure about at the moment:
(But I think I'm leaning towards this being a valid PO)

Mark receives 3 Blots.

I think we're beginning to with Indulgences.  The reason VTs and
P-Notes haven't really generated an economy is that they're not
scarce enough to be valuable--everyone has as many as they want,
so no one's trading.

Let me try to summarize the trend of the discussion so far, concerning
what we want, not necessarily what we have (especially after CFJ 942
was judged false). 

We do not want the situation (from the earlier proto) for a CFJ that
fails to comply with all relevant requirements that

>>
2. It remains a CFJ, but violates 789, with no obvious consequence
(except a possible penalty due to 1439).
<<

because that involves unwanted "red tape" and red tape penalties.

We do not want 

>>
1. A la Kudo transfers: A document that fails to comply with 789 is
not a CFJ after all (and 789 takes precedence over the higher-numbered
991. 
<<

either, because that puts the burden of sifting out the "real" CFJs on
the CotC instead of the judges. (And it does not work in the present
situation after the judgement of CFJ 942, anyway)

We want a possibility for the CotC to assign a CFJ to a judge even if
it is potentially invalid, and the judge needs a possibility to
dismiss it if it is.

So version 2 of the Judicial cleanup proto includes the following
amendments:

1. In 991 replace the second paragraph by

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a potential Call for 
      Judgement.

2. In 1565 replace the first sentence by 

      A Judge must dismiss a potential CFJ if one of the following 
      is true of it:

and the old point v) by

      v) It does not meet the requirements for CFJs established by 
         the Rules.

3. Cosmetic changes as in V.1:

In 1565 replace the string "when only when" in the third paragraph by
"only when".

And in the last paragraph of 1565 replace "a Judicial Salary of 3 Mil"
by "a Judicial Salary of 1 VT".

-------
Open questions: 

- How important is it to use the full phrase "potential CFJ"
throughout the rules? I.e., should all references to a "CFJ" before it
is assigned to a judge and not dismissed be changed to "potential
CFJ"? This would require amendments of 991, 897, 1563, 951, 698, 1567,
1568, 1565 in addition to the changes listed explicitly in this proto.

With the exception of these explicitly listed changes listed I think
this would be unnecessary ballast, but purists may disagree (or
loopholes may appear).

In 1526 (Excess CFJs) it might actually make a difference, so maybe
"potential" should be added there, as well.

Of course, rules with requirements like 789 or 1500 should not be
changed to requirements for "potential" CFJs, or we're back to square
one with the same problem as before.

- Does anyone have a better phrase than "potential" CFJ? Provisional,
wannabe, putative, tentative... where's that thesaurus when I need it?

See CFJ 942; R991 has a power of 2 and takes precedence over R789.

Right, it was just an idea, and I hope/suppose you are right that the
problems are just temporary. Consider the Proto dropped.

Thanks for all your help, Crito. I think I just about have a grasp on the 
situation -- now I just need to dive into the Ruleset. Hopefully I'll 
make a judgement tonight or tomorrow.

As far as I can see, the phrase is not needed at all. There is no reason
why a dismissed CFJ cannot still be a CFJ - that is how the current
system works.

I reiterate my suggestion to use the phrase "lacks standing" instead,
given that it is already in the Ruleset.

Bravo. Splendid idea. I think there are better ways of reducing
access to voting, if that's what we want to do, then using
some cumbersome mathematical system. Such as, for instance,
my suggestion to divide Players into Senators, who can only
propose, and Legislators who can only vote.

If the tax goes to those with few VT's, maybe.

If the native English speakers agree with that, I'm perfectly happy
not to change anything (except for the cosmetics) and dismiss CFJs
like 938 as "lacking standing". But I thought that lack of standing
referred to a completely different point than the one that caused the
problems around CFJ 938.

It would require more than just the cosmetic changes.  You would still have to
rework the Rules so that "lacks standing" is properly defined in a way that
covers the general case which includes that in CFJ 938.

On the other hand, new ideas are decried for being "too radical".

I think you're right.  The main problem right now is finding
commodities to trade for Indulgences.  Especially with since Voting

I believe this is in error.  To apply the standard of Rule 693/3 to
Proposals made prior to its disinfection strikes me as a prohibited
retroactive effect.  It is my opinion that all Proposals distributed
during Rule 693's infection are forever deprived of a Voting Period,
short of adopting a measure which specifically grants those Proposals
an exceptional Voting Period.

This has to be one of the most interesting infections we've had yet.

In American jurisprudence, it's parties that have or lack standing,
not complaints or petitions.  To be consistent with common usage, the
Rule would have to state "its Caller lacks standing."  Since the use
of "standing" in the Rules is already inconsistent with common usage,
there is no reason to not make it more so.

I would not object to a definition that a CFJ submitted in violation

I don't like the "potential CFJ" concept.  A CFJ is a CFJ; some CFJs
are such that they must be dismissed.  The "potential CFJ" concept is,
in my opinion, an unnecessary multiplication of entities.  It should
suffice to require a Judge to dismiss any CFJ improperly submitted,
where "improperly submitted" is appropriately defined.

I've got a judicial reform (started only a few weeks after the last
big judicial reform) sitting on a back burner somewhere.  Maybe I
should dig it out...  :)

My scan of the Rules shows the only prohibitions regarding retroactive effects
are:

    A notation to R113 that Players cannot deregister retroactively.

    Document ratifications cannot be construed to have changed
    the game state retroactively, they only change it at the time
    the document was ratified.

    A Rule change cannot be applied retroactively.

In this case the Rule change is not being applied retroactively.  The Rule
change takes place at the moment of disinfection, but then the enforcement of
the changed Rule has retroactive effects, but these effects do not include any
document ratifications or rule changes.  IMO, this kind of retroactive effect
is not prohibited by the Rules.

>This has to be one of the most interesting infections we've had yet.

Please note that the following is the current Rule related to the matter:


      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is

Hmmmm. Perhaps. Of course, then some officers get the short end of the stick. What can the Mad 
Scientist charge for?

What we need is another valuble commodity. The problem there is coming up with something else we 
could allow people to trade that would be useful enough. Something like the old Powers might 
work, if we made them more powerful.

Personally, I expect that the Plots proto could produce some interesting economic effects, even 
if it wouldn't lead to an "economy" (anyone want to recruit the few thousand members we'd need 
for that?)

I support it as well. It's there, waiting to be used, *and* it fits well with what we are 
defining.

This particular proto is not very MUDlike. In fact, the current Agoraverse paradigm is far more 
MUDdy that this would be.

In this case, since the Author of a Rule is a Rule-defined word, I would suggest that Murphy 
simply go with "H, B, and A are the Authors of each..."

As Zefram should readily admit. I would like to remind Scott, though, that he and his fellow 
Threats have done their fair share of quashing said "radical" ideas.

No, you misunderstood me. I was imagining a 3 week infection period;
after that, of course, the Rule gets disinfected, and Proposals which
get distributed having their VPs commence normally. Without Emergency
or Guillotine Proposals, however, that wouldn't be enough to get under
R1698, since without them, it would take 10 days to get a Proposal adopted.

To be precise, my claim was: if the Virus had a three week infection
period, if there were no Emergency or Guillotine Proposals, then the
infection of R693 would have been blocked by R1698.

The Mad Scientist doesn't need a salary, as the Office has substantial
power already.  Besides, not having a salary gives the M.S. an

Heh.  Agora would be far more interesting if it had a couple hundred
players, instead of slightly less than a double dozen.

Inertia wasn't any more radical, in heart, than the reform embodied in
Proposal 3445.  Inertia was quashed not for its radicality but for its
unnecessary complexity, and the Threat was by no means the only voice
opposing it.

I tend to think of the Threat as being moderately to strongly
progressive in outlook; not in the least conservative.

After my experience here before, and now returning to these same 
discussions, I am becoming more and more convinced that the only viable 
'nomic economy' will result when someone puts up a reasonably large sum 
of 'real' money and pledges to distribute it based on some game function, 
converted of course into our local currencies...

Any benevolent tycoons out there?  :)

On the other hand that kind of seems to violate the spirit of our 
self-contained world...

This is true. Despite Zefram's protests to the contrary, I *understood*
Scott's proposal when I read it. I had Inertia explained to me and I 
*still* didn't get it.

I never suggested that the Threat quashed ideas *because* they were 
progressive, merely that they have quashed progressive ideas because
they didn't like them, which is not the same thing.

Well, yes. What I meant was that we would need to come up with another
idea for a Currency or Commodity and *what it would be good for* that
would *make* it useful. Once we've got that, we can set the scarcity to 
whatever we want.

But that power is good for little practical. While e can manipulate
the game in interesting ways, it is very rarely that e can do so for
personal benefit. Chaos seems to be the best possible result (not that

I say that if we abolish the MS salary, we give eir the power
to change one additional noun in the sentence to *anything* e
chooses. *Then* I'll have some fun. :P

I can barely imagine a Nomic with a triple-digit player count. I'm sure
it would be incredibly fun, though. Perhaps we should suggest to the
Internet Nomic community that we try running a Nomic with every player
from every Nomic and see what happens...

Easier said than done, I think.  VTs and P-Notes are both useful,
but it's not all that easy to make them scarce enough to involve
them in an economy.  I think there's a tension (at least for
me, there is) between "having an economy (an Interesting Thing)"
and "being able to Propose and Vote whenever I want."

I think a lot of people would object on the grounds of time limitations.
*However* this could be a good thing if we could actually get
them to play, as it would be an incentive to change from a
strict democracy to a representative democracy, which could
be interesting. (And more appropriate in a 100-player nomic
than it would be in a 20-player nomic.)  Hmm, it could be
interesting to try to change internomic to this--instead of
having member nomics be players, have all players in all member
nomics be players of IN.  (Of course, a player in more than
one member nomic is still only one IN player.)

I also note that the formulation used in the proto is in the form of a
command to the Rulekeepor.  It has not yet been established that
Proposals are empowered to issue commands, and I suspect that they
are, in fact, unable to do so.  (This is something I would like to
change.)
