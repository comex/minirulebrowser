It seems to me that Judge Crito has a choice as to which of two views,
or two possible meanings of the term 'clear indication', to prefer.

According to my view, a 'clear indication' is one which, had it been
read by a normal person, would have succeeded in indicating. This is a
pretty clear test to apply, which I suppose is one reason I think Judge
Crito would be justified in accepting it.

Your view seems a bit murkier to me: evidence about how a message is
received by its actual audience is going to count in weighing up whether
an indication is clear. But as Ole has perceptively pointed out, the
audience may have complex motives in responding to what it reads. This
makes your test a lot less clear.

But here's another way to think about it, employing a distinction
between messages and collections of text contained in them. If R1483 had
said this:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers a
      message to the Public Forum which clearly indicates that some
      part of the text of the message is intended to become a Proposal.

then I think your argument that it is the entire message which must
clearly indicate would have a lot more force. But as we all know, what
R1483 actually says is:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.

and this wording I think strengthens my contention that it is not the
entire message which has to be clear, but only some collection of text
within it.

But that begs the question - the word 'clear' itself means 'free from 
ambiguity, opaqueness'; our (myself, Michael et al's) contention is 
that the fact of burying the (potential) Proposal within a long spam 
so that it wouldn't be noticed as such made your intent unclear - 
added opaqueness, in other words - and we point at the actual 
reaction of the Players to the message as supporting evidence.

You want us to accept that your post was like the curate's egg - 
parts of it were very clear - but as in that parable, separating the 
part from the whole isn't really an option; we had to eat the whole 
egg - interpret the entire message. The part of your post that was   
originally a 'clear indication' - that would indubitably have been a 
'clear indication' if it had stood on its own - was, we submit, made 
unclear by the surrounding obfuscatory material.

Well put Morendil!  I won't try to add to your very nice summary of
the position. 

There's perhaps one other slight doubt about the mechanism of Summary
Adoption.  Rule 1883/0 said in section (c) "When a Proposal is Adopted
Without Objection, it is removed from the Queue."  This requirement was
impossible to satisfy as the proposal in question (if it was a
proposal) wasn't at that stage in the Queue.  (Adding proposals to the
Queue is something that the Promotor must do themself, it does not
happen automatically/Platonically (see Rule 1036)).

Michael.

No, not necessarily.  I think there would still have been a good
argument to the effect that it was unclear.  We are not saying that
the absence of observers is equivalent to lack of clarity, instead we
are saying that absence of observers is *evidence* supporting the
claim of lack of clarity.

If one person had seen it, we would have slightly weaker evidence
"Only one of a dozen people managed to see the text as a Proposal,
that suggests it was not clear."

Ole's point about the possibility of people having seen it and chosen
not to mention it would be more relevant if someone actually stood up
and claimed that this had happened in their case.  As it is, it does
seem to be the fact that:
   * no-one (except Steve of course) perceived the putative Proposal
     as one. 

Players who did spot the Proposal are invited to let us know. 

The whole "tree falling in the forest unobserved" paradox is
completely irrelevant.  We are not disputing that the proposal text
was there, which is what arguing from analogy with the tree in the
forest would require.  Instead, we are claiming that it was not
accompanied by a clear indication that it was a proposal text.
  
Michael.

I don't see that the impossibility of satisfying (c) invalidates any
other sections of the Rule.

Well, perhaps.  Certainly I do only see it as a "slight doubt".
However, I would have thought that separate clauses in a rule such as
this one were implicitly meant to be joined by "and".

Eek.  Do you realize that this means most of those Priority increases done
simultaneously with or shortly after proposing were illegal?

Yes, but where is the justification that R1483 must be interpreted as
requiring us to "eat the whole egg"?  Again, it's not that it is an
unreasonable interpretation, it's just that I have yet to see a
convincing argument that it is *more* justified than the "stand
alone" interpretation.  In fact, the wording of R1483, as Steve
recently pointed out, tends to favor the "stand alone" version.

Which begs the question: Does this make the Votings on these Proposals
illegal?

I tried to go down this route, but a Proposal is officially a Proposal even
before it is placed in the Queue, and nothing in the SA rule requires a
Proposal to be in the Queue before it can be adopted.  Even if we
accept that the clauses are joined by "and", this means the Rule
could require the Promotor to do something impossible - remove from the
Queue a Proposal which is not in the Queue.  The only sensible
interpretations of the Rule are to say that either section c)  requires
the Promotor to perform a null action in this circumstance or that the

R1771 says:

      A Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal
      in the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so,
      and paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank.

There is no restriction here on when the announcement must be made.  It's
probably a reasonable interpretation to say that a Player may announce
eir intention to increase or decrease the priority of a Proposal at any
time, but the change does not occur until it is placed in the Queue.

"of a Proposal in the Queue" implies that the proposal is in the queue 
at the time of the attempted change in priority.  Thus, if an attempt 
is made to increase the priority of any proposal that is not in the 
queue is made then such an attempt is not supported by the rules.  

I think this has to be the case unless the player states "I pay... for 
the purposes of .... at such a time as when the proposal enters the 
queue" or such like.

Absolutely correct.  But the issue here is what actually changes the priority?
Game custom seems to hold that it is the Promotor that changes the priority
on the authority of the Rules based on the announcement and payment.
We tend to hold to this even when the Rules are worded as above, which
make it look like an automatic effect of the original Player's actions.  It is
left unspecified when the Promotor must do this after having received
the announcement.

If we take the view that the Player emself directly raises the
priority of the Proposal by eir announcement and payment, then
this would be correct.  Incidentally, this would make the payment
a Delayed Transfer Order.

It is not necessary for a player to actually see the indication for it to be
clear.  Imagine if you will:

A child is given a pain reliever for a headache, suffers an overdose and
dies (god forbid).  The drug company points out that although the parents
didn't read the bottle it clearly indicates only one tablet should be given
to children of that age.  You, as judge, read the label and see that an
indication to that effect is, in fact, there.  Also the wording of the
indication is very plain and straightforward, in fact you might call it
clear.  However, since it isn't in the dosage section, but is in fact buried
in a bunch of flowery text about how the product is made only from the most
natural of plants grown in the Andes mountains, farmed by native workers who
have used the herb for 10 generations, blah, blah, blah, you decide that the
indication was far from clear in any way that matters and the drug company
is guilty of gross negligence.

Now, do you care to argue with the grieving parents that it was a clear
indication?  Or do you recognize that there is more to a clear indication
than clear wording?

In my opinion, an indication by itself is neither clear or unclear.  It is
merely an indication.  Clarity is in the eye of the beholder.  If the
clarity doesn't lie there, then where does it lie?    If I indicate in
Swahili that I want to submit a proposal, is that clear if no one in the
game knows the tongue but me (I don't but this is just hypothetical)?  Even
the acrostic example was clear once it was pointed out.  Of course before it
was pointed out, it is was unclear.  The entire context of the indication
must be considered.

Webster's Online Dictionary defines clear thusly:

     Main Entry: 1clear
     Pronunciation: 'klir
     Function: adjective
     Etymology: Middle English clere, from Old French cler, from Latin
clarus
     clear, bright; akinto Latin calare to call -- more at LOW
     Date: 13th century
     1 a : BRIGHT, LUMINOUS b : CLOUDLESS; specifically : less than
one-tenth
     covered <a clear sky> c : free from mist, haze, or dust <a clear day>
     d : UNTROUBLED, SERENE <a clear gaze>
     2 : CLEAN, PURE: as a : free from blemishes b : easily seen through :
     TRANSPARENT c : free from abnormal sounds on auscultation
     3 a : easily heard b : easily visible : PLAIN c : free from obscurity
or
     ambiguity : easily understood : UNMISTAKABLE
     4 a : capable of sharp discernment : KEEN b : free from doubt : SURE
     5 : free from guile or guilt : INNOCENT
     6 : unhampered by restriction or limitation: as a : unencumbered by
     debts or charges b : NET <a clear profit> c : UNQUALIFIED, ABSOLUTE d :
     free from obstruction e : emptied of contents or cargo f : free from
     entanglement g : BARE, DENUDED

I would say that 3a, 3b, 4b, 6d are just about what I think of when I think
of a clear indication.  I also think that this definition is in the best
interests of the game.  If a reasonable person, or perhaps the 'average'
person, would find the indication clear in the context in which it was
presented then it is clear.  Otherwise it is not.

In my opinion, Steve's indication was not clear.  It does not meet
definition 6d above in that it is not free from obstruction.

I honestly don't want to support this conclusion.  I think it will remove
many nice scamming opportunities but I feel that it is the best
interpretation.

I don't agree with this at all.  The clear indication is NOT within the
collection of text.  Rather the text is delivered "with the clear
indication".  No actual written indication is required by this rule.  It
only requires that when the text is sent it is clear that the intention is
to create a Proposal.  There is nothing to state what form this indication
must take.  If we made a separate list called Agora-Proposals and by custom
posted only proposals there, then I submit that anything posted there could
be said to have clear indication of intent to become a Proposal unless it
was clear indicated otherwise.

The fact is that you delivered some collection of text to the Public Forum
hidden so as to be unclear that that text was intended to become a Proposal.
Only by the narrowest of definitions can this be said to have been done
"with clear indication."

This is off topic, but what are
the australian laws concerning cocaine?

Is it as severely demonized as here?
