Well, as usual I cool down after a while, and I think I might even grow
to like the new environment.  So yes.

Now I just need to get through my mailbox and do the updates... the
Ruleset seems to change a bit faster than the Proto :-)

I figured that if I wanted to encourage politicking and small trade I
could just as well include Presence too.

But it does stretch the continuity of R1432 rather further than we have
previously considered.  It seems weird to have continuity across a long
period of "non-existence".

It is an elegant way of looking at it, though.

    Jester transfers one Kudo FROM Jester TO Murhpy.

    I transfer one Kudo from myself, for being fairly quiet lately,
                        to Murphy, for cleaning up probate.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Incorrect.  I'd appreciate if you gave Jester back his Kudo and took
it away from me.

   PROPOSAL (Fix the Coercion/Bribery Loophole)
   This Proposal shall have an AI=2

        Rule 1561 is amended to read as follows.

             Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players
             to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not
             vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or
             another Proposal) shall be completely without effect,
             even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary
             notwithstanding.

          {Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to
                     bribes to vote FOR or AGAINST.  It's perfectly
                     legal to bribe someone to not vote
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What's particularly annoying about this is that I had this exact same
idea two weeks ago, and even contacted some Players about pulling it
off.  *sigh*

Actually, this part of the Swann's attempted scam is an old idea.
Compare Proposals 2686 (Morendil, Sep 1996) and 3557 (Steve, Oct 1997):

Proposal 2686 (Morendil, AI=2)

A Win For Morendil

Create a Rule reading :

   At the time this Rule is enacted, Player Morendil Wins the Game.
   For the purposes of Rule 112, that Player shall have fulfilled a Win 
   Condition defined by this Rule at the time of its creation.

   Furthermore, at that time 1 EV is transferred from the Bank to any 
   Player who did not Vote on the Proposal which resulted in the creation 
   of this Rule.

   Furthermore, at that time 5 EVs are transferred from the Bank to any
   Player who voted to ABSTAIN on the Proposal which resulted in the 
   creation of this Rule.

   All transfers required by this Rule shall be reported by the Assessor. 
   As soon as all such transfers have been reported, this Rule repeals 
   itself.

Amend Rule 1561 to read :

   Any Proposal offering a bribe based on a Player's Voting strategy on a 
   given Proposal (either itself or another Proposal) shall be completely
   without effect, even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary
   notwithstanding.

[Comments: perhaps Rule 1561 isn't perfect yet. In a now well-established
tradition, this fixes the small loophole that remains in that Rule -- but 
not without moving some EVs around first. :)]

Proposal 3557 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
A Win by Bribery for Steve

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled, "A Win by Bribery for Steve"
be created with the following text:

      The creation of this Rule is a Win condition for Steve.

      Furthermore, as soon as possible after the creation of this
      Rule, the Assessor shall pay out 3 Voting Tokens and 2
      Indulgences to each Player who declared eir Presence and did
      not vote either FOR or AGAINST the Proposal whose adoption
      resulted in the creation of this Rule.

      This Rule repeals itself when the Assessor has executed the
      Payment Orders specified above.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1561 be amended to read:

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST, or to declare Presence, on a
      Proposal (either itself or another Proposal) shall be
      completely without effect, even if it is adopted, any Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

Have we ever considered how far the continuity of R14342 stretches?
The Rule itself says nothing which would limit the time which may elapse
between deregistration and reregistration.
