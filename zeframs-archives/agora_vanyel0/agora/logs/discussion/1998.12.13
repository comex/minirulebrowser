i felt my judgement would be overturned, no matter what i decided.  I
did read the discussion.  I thought about it and i judged.  I tried to
do so in a timely fashion so the appeals could begin quickly.

The Rules need not make any such distinction. To my mind, the most
natural way of understanding the meaning of the phrase "prescribed
Voting Period" is "that period during which it is legal to cast votes on
a Proposal". This cannot be changed retroactively, as you note.

The real question, and one which has not yet definitely been settled, is
whether the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal can be changed after
the beginning, but before the end, of the VP, as it was defined to be
when the Proposal was distributed. Actually, we can answer that question
in the affirmative, thanks to the Guillotine. But the Guillotine claims
precedence over R693, as it needs to do in order to be effective. So a
way of refining the question is: should we understand the action of
amending R693 to shorten the VP of a Proposal as analogous to the action
of the Guillotine? 

The answer is not as obvious as you might think. The simple retort that
new verions of Rules take precedence of old ones, for example, does not
settle the question, for it is not necessarily the case that the old and
new version of R693 are in conflict. Whether they are understood to be
in conflict depends on how you see the operation of R693. Does R693
establish the VPs of a Proposal when it is distributed by a kind of 'set
and forget' method, or is the VP of a Proposal in a relationship of
continuous dependence on the precise text of R693? If it is the former,
then the old and new versions are not in conflict, for we can understand
each new version of R693 as applying only to Proposals distributed after
that version takes effect. If it is the latter, then the two versions
are in conflict, and an understanding analogous to that of the
Guillotine seems appropriate.

Here game custom can help us. I think the historical examples pretty
clearly show that the former view has been favoured over the latter.

To my mind, an event, broadly speaking is "something that happens". It
seems pretty obvious to me that the commencement and conclusion of a VP
are both "things that happen", and hence that both can be thought of as
events.

I don't think that in the circumstances you could rationally believe
that an Appeals Board would overturn your Judgement no matter what it
was. Our interests lie in supporting good Judgements and overturning bad
ones. Perhaps what you meant to say is that you thought your Judgement
would be *appealed* no matter what you decided; given the
controversiality of the issues, that may be true. But it might not be -
I probably would not have appealed a carefully reasoned Judgement, even
if I disagreed with its conclusions, and I certainly would not have
overturned it: see my Judgement of the Appeal of your very first Agoran
Judgement, in CFJ 1100, where I stated:

     My own views on the clarity or unclarity of R1808, whether they are
     in agreement with lee's or not, are not to the point. What is
     important is whether lee's view was one that a reasonable person
     was entitled to take of the situation. In making his Judgement,
     what lee has really done is contribute a creative act to the game,
     a considered act borne out of his own particular set of aesthetic
     responses to the situation. In my view the proper role of the Board
     of Appeals is to encourage such creative contributions to the game
     by respecting them as much as possible.

I think that in this case, you have, sadly, passed up a golden
opportunity to contribute another creative act to the game by delivering
a closely reasoned Judgement which considered the issues raised.
Instead, you've completely copped out.
