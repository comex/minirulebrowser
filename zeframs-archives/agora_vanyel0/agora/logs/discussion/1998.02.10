I hate to see people Leave in a Huff (even when they do it in an amusing way),
so I'll make a couple of observations that I hope Sherlock will find
constructive.

1.  Agorans are generally fond of sarcasm and of being somewhat provocative.
    It has almost always (in my experience) been good natured and in a spirit
    of fun, as I think it was meant in this case.  It's hard to resist a little
    poke at ambiguity (you *did* neglect to specify exactly who would pay
    Murphy).  After all, that's what a lot of the play in Agora is about.  8)

2.  We tend to think of any idea that someone kicks around as being a
    potential proposal and are apt to respond to it as such.  You will 
    probably notice that most ideas are presented in the form of
    proto-proposals.

3.  I don't think anyone was trying to "jump down your throat", they just had
    some objections to your idea (see 1).  I think everyone would agree that
    your suggestion was a reasonable one, even those who don't like it.

4.  Keep those ideas coming.  Everyone has good ones and bad ones (even though
    we can't always agree on which are which 8).  The more we kick around
    the better.

I'd like to hear what other people's opinions are about this sort of 
thing. What sort of services do you think should be publically funded,
by payment from the bank, and what sort of things should be paid for by
the individual users?

Just for the sake of a change, I'm mounting a user-pays platform at the
moment. I think we've spent enough time publically subsidising Officers
and New Players. Would anyone be interested in changing things so that
Officers were allowed to charge fees for their services?

For example, I never read Cartographor or Notary Reports. If I had the 
option, I would not subscribe to them. 

I suppose the problem is that players could easily scam a subscription
system by getting copies from a friend. I'm not sure how you could 
avoid that. But charging fees for various operations which require 
changes to the report might be possible.

This is all pretty speculative. Anyone have any ideas?

How about replacing "results" with "would result"?

A couple of years ago I wrote a Radical EcoNomic Manifesto proposing
a user pays system, but my view was that Agora was unlikely ever to
evolve in such a game. A conclusion I was not unhappy with, I might
add.

It's a major obstacle, and I can't see a way around it. But in any
case, I think the argument that proposal results at least should be
publically funded is pretty persuasive. Even in these days of Public
Voting, when each Player could in principle tally the results for
emselves, having a central authority announce the Official results is
nigh indispensable (cf R376). I'd also argue that the Official
Reports of the Herald, Registrar, Assessor and especially the
Rulekeepor are of public benefit and therefore likewise merit public
funding.

Possible, certainly. Transaction fees, and the like. But I'm skeptical
that the interest of such schemes would be worth the enormous amount
of extra paperwork they would entail. Transaction fees are irksome
enough when they are deducted automatically from your account. If I
had to write a cheque every month to pay them, they would be intolerable.
Pragmatic Currencies closes off any possibility of automatic deductions.

I've added an amendment to R1547 to remove the last of the confusing
language about 'casting Voting Tokens'. Votes are cast; Voting Tokens
are spent.

Having now read Scott's Omnibus Reform Proposal, I see that he has dealt
with the same territory there covered here, including Michael's
suggestion of suspending the voting privileges of Players who fail to
pay for their votes, a suggestion I really like. Ideally I'd like
just to add the parts of Omnibus Reform which deal with suspension to
my proto, but these depend on the broader framework of Judicial
Orders set out in Scott's proto. So I think the best course is to
persist with my proto, and wait for Omnibus Reform to add suspension
of voting priveleges.

I'm persisting with my separate proto because Omnibus Reform deals
with so many other matters, whereas I'm interested chiefly in just
this one at the moment.


####
Proto-Proposal
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor - tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping - into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

[Summary: this Proposal creates 1 Rule, repeals 2 Rules (1731, 1653), and
amends 6 Rules (1449, 1696, 1442, 206, 1717, 1547).]

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]

Be it further resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Cast VTs)
be amended to read:

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

Sherlock's misinterpretation of my recent message has got me curious.
Is the use of "to stir" to mean to say something just to cause mischief, 
and not so much because you mean it, purely an Australian thing?

It's something well-understood by at least this New Zealander.  It
could be an Australasianism, but I've just had a chat with my American
office mate and she says that she would understand the expression, but
that she's more familiar with the idea expressed as "to stir things
up". 

She hadn't heard of "stirrer" (i.e., a person who stirs) though. 

Michael.

All right--I didn't realize that.  My mistake.

The throat comment was a bit overboard, too.  Sorry for getting all huffy.

Thanks for the encouraging and helpful note.

Again, I apologize to Blob for reacting a bit strongly to his message.

For what it's worth, I always use the Web-based rules.  Thus, it would
be very difficult indeed for me to play without them. ;)

We have a similar use here in the U.S. The problem is that "Don't
worry; I'm just stirring" in the way you used it could have two meanings:

  1.) As you mean it:
       "No, really! Don't worry! I am just being provocative, but not
        against you."
  
  2.) As I saw it:
       "The last paragraph was just the beginning; I'm just stirring."
        (meaning here to get started--do you have this meaning in
         Australia?) [In this interpretation, it could come off as a
         bit of a threat.]

I think the idea is interesting. (Scott, could you dig up your "fees" proto
and repost that? It was an interesting take on the idea...) However, I *do*
feel that we should still "subsidize" new Players -- as many have said, new
Players are our "greatest resource," and when you're new, you don't feel
ready to go around looking for donations. I don't think it would
neccesarily be that difficult for most new Players -- look how much we've
done for our current new Players -- but I still think the principle is
important enough not to change

Indeed. A number of the Reports are not useful to every player: the
Wizard's Report would also fall in this category.

This is like Scott's proto -- rather than charging for their reports
(which, as we've pointed out, are a small part of some Officer's jobs),
this Proto would allow Officers to charge for their services.

In America, at least, one hears "to stir things up," which means to make
things more exciting or interesting, often in a mischevious way. As
Sherlock mentioned, "stirring" by itself can also mean "awakening" or
"beginning."

This week.  This has the unfortunate consequence that a Silly Person might
get a short time to make the Proposal.  I considered making a Proto to
change that to next week instead, but I never went anywhere with it.

My view of this is that the Virus' most important role was not to disrupt
the Ruleset, but to illuminate rarely visited parts of it.

The Repeal-O-Matic now has a similar role.  So does the Read the Ruleset
Week - it is disappointing to see that only a few Players seem to have
actually read the Ruleset during the Week, not even enough for Chuck to
use up his promised 5 P-Note awards.  Not that I really blame anyone, it
took me several hours each day for 4 days to do it myself.

I have been toying with the idea of selecting a random Rule each Week for
careful scrutiny.  Although I found lots of things from reading the
Ruleset (thus proving that illumination beyond ordinary day-to-day use is
quite necessary), there is a limit to how carefully you can consider each
Rule when reading in bulk.  (I tried to improve my concentration a bit by
reading a-whispering, but still.)

I'll look and see if I still have a copy around here somewhere.  (I've
got nearly 15 megs in my Agora directory, so it's possible...)

How would you propose handling this?  Waiving the publication
requirement, and allow interested parties to subscribe to the Officer
in question instead?  (I suppose a depository requirement, requiring
one to file a copy with the Archivist without fee, would be in order.
Of course, the Archivist could charge a fee for pulling a copy out of
eir records....)

I wouldn't do this for certain reports, especially the publication of
new Proposals ("What?  I have to pay to find out what I'm voting
FOR?") and of Proposal results, but I can see it for many other things
currently required to be published.  Would probably lower the traffic
on the mailing list quite a bit, too, which might be a Good Thing. :)

Protoproposal Chaos32 [rev. 1]

Capitalism, Ho!

[Note: This Protoproposal has not been substantially revised since
last July, and therefore is probably out of sync with the current
Rules in some areas.]

Title I: General Authorization

This Title establishes a general system by which Officers controls
fees, taxes, and commissions on certain actions.
      
1. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Fees" be created with
the following text:
      
      The Rules may require that the payment of a fee be required for
      certain actions to have legal effect.  When an action is subject
      to such a restriction, the action so restricted has no legal
      effect until and unless the required fee is paid or waived
      An action which is subject to a non-zero fee does not take
      place, any other Rule notwithstanding, unless and until the fee
      is paid to the Officer who controls the fee for that action.

      Each fee has zero or more rates.  Each rate is specified as a
      fixed positive number of units of one Currency.  For each
      Currency, at most one of rates of a given fee may be specified
      in that Currency; if a fee has two or more rates specified in
      the same Currency, the least of all such rates prevails.  A rate
      which is not specified in the form of a positive number of units
      of exactly one Currency is not valid.  If no valid rates are
      specified for a fee, then that fee is zero.  Initially, every
      fee has no valid rate.

      A fee is paid when a Transfer Order is successfully executed for
      a number of units of a Currency matching one of its rates, from
      the entity attempting to perform that action, to the Officer
      controlling that fee, and for the purpose of paying that fee.

      Whenever the Rules require a Player to perform an action, and
      that action has a fee, that Player is permitted to, after paying
      the fee, execute a Payment Order from the Bank to emself for the
      amount of the fee.

      The execution of a Transfer Order for the purpose of paying a
      fee shall not be subject to any fee, tax, or commission of any
      sort, any other Rule notwithstanding.

      The Officer who controls a fee is authorized to add to it a new
      rate, and to increase one of its existing rates, Without
      Objection.  E may reduce or delete one of its existing rates
      simply by announcing the intended change in the Public Forum.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each fee, its
      rate(s), and the Office controlling it.  The Chancellor controls
      a fee for adding, deleting, or changing the rate of a fee.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Taxes" be created with
the following text:
      
      A "tax" is a surcharge on an action which does not need to be
      paid prior to the action having effect.  An action is subject to
      a tax only if the Rules specifically so state, and only if the
      Rules state which Officer controls that tax.

      Within one week of when an action for which there is a non-zero
      tax is performed, the Officer who controls the tax for that
      action is permitted to execute a Payment Order from the entity
      which performed that action to emself for an amount equal to the
      rate of that tax at the time the action was performed.  However,
      no Payment Order shall be executed if the entity who performed
      that action was the Officer controlling the commission.

      The rate of a tax shall be specified either as zero, or as a
      positive number of units of exactly one Currency.  The Officer
      who controls a tax is authorized to change its rate Without
      Objection, and may further change it to zero, or to a lesser
      number of the same Currency in which it is presently specified,
      simply by announcing the change in the Public Forum.

      The execution of a Transfer Order for the purpose of satisfying
      a Payment Order executed to collect a tax shall not be subject
      to any fee, tax, or commission of any sort, any other Rule
      notwithstanding.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each tax, its
      rate, and the Office controlling it.  The Chancellor controls a
      fee for changing the rate of a tax.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule titled "Commissions" be
created with the following text:
      
      A "commission" is a surcharge on certain types of Transfer Orders. 
      A Transfer Order is subject to a commission only if the Rules
      specifically so state, and only if the Rules state which Officer
      controls that commission.

      Within one week of when a Transfer Order for which there is a
      non-zero commission is successfully executed, the Officer who
      controls the commission for that Transfer Order is permitted to
      execute a Payment Order from the recipient of the original
      Transfer Order to emself for an amount equal to that
      commission's percentage (at the time the Transfer Order was
      executed) of the amount originally transferred, rounded down.
      However, no Payment Order shall be executed if the recipient of
      the original Transfer Order was the Officer controlling the
      commission, or if the amount of the resulting Payment Order
      would be zero.

      The rate of a commission shall be a percentage between 0% and
      100%, inclusive.  The Officer who controls a commission is
      authorized to increase its rate Without Objection, and may
      reduce it simply by announcing the change in the Public Forum.

      No commission shall apply to Transfer Orders made in order to
      satisfy a Payment Order executed to collect a commission, any
      Rule (including this one) notwithstanding.

      The Chancellor shall maintain a schedule listing each
      commission, its rate, and the Office controlling it.  The
      Chancellor controls a fee for changing the rate of a commission.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Title II: Specific Fees

This Title establishes a largish number of fees, so that most Officers
will be remunerated in proportion to the work they do.

1. Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by adding the

Well, Steve claimed to have done nothing.  I checked, and your university
has now created MX records for the machine names, so that mail to them is
instead delivered to the one that accepts mail.

I have no objection to this, by the way.  My objection to the Virus is

I've done this in the past.  The problem now is that our Rules are so

correct a few minor problems with Crimes and Infractions.)

Protoproposal Chaos22 [rev. 13]

The Omnibus Reform Act of 1998

| [Note: This protoproposal would create several small new Rules.  Many
|  of them are the result of "slice & dice" on old long rules.  I
|  believe that it's easier to understand several small rules than one
|  big one.  To this end, I have sought to divide Rules up as much as
|  possible, keeping otherwise separable provisions in a single Rule
|  only when necessary to support a precedence demand.

|  Also, I would appreciate a title analysis.]

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------

| Title I: Orders

| Chapter 1: Definition ------------------------------------------------

| Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
|     to refrain from performing one or more actions.  

|     An Order may be directed to the holder of an Office or other
|     official position in eir capacity as that Office or other
|     official position, and in this case if the Office or position
|     changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
|     by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
|     Office or position.  
| 
|     Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
|     to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
|     other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
|     affects.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      There are four classes of Order: Administrative, Judicial,
      Appellate, and Private.  

      A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a Player while acting
      as a Judge.

      An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a Board of Appeals.

      An Administrative Order is an Order executed by the holder of an
      Office or other official position (such as the Speaker or the
      Recordkeepor of a Currency) other than that of a Judge or
      Justice, in the course of performing the duties of that Office
      or position.

      A Private Order is any other sort of Order.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
|     when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
|     given, or if the specification given would require the
|     performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
|     effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
|     the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.
| 
|     This Rule defers to any Rule which establishes regulations
|     relating to the performance of duties required by various sorts
|     of Orders, and only establishes the time by which an Order must
|     be performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
|     not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
|     effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
|     which the actions it requires must be performed.
|     
| Chapter 2: Validity of Orders ----------------------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.  

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid is not liable for eir actions; but other
      Rules may establish procedures for correcting or remedying
      such circumstances when they occur.

| Chapter 3: Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders -------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.
| 
      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
|     amendment becomes effective.  
| 
|     Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
|     to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.
| 
|     Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
|     vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily deny the stayed
|     Order from having any effect.  
| 
|     A stay may be ordered for a fixed time, in which case the stay
|     expires at the time specified; or for an indefinite time, in
|     which case the stay will not expire.  If no specification is
|     made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall be indefinite.  
| 
|     When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
|     again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
|     moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
|     the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
|     the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
|     staying Order, it does not regain effect.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

| Chapter 4: Judicial Orders -------------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
      
      Judicial Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts, but do not take effect until their publication by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each
      Judicial Order as soon as possible after receiving it from the
      Judge who executed it.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:      
| 
      Judicial Orders are subject to appeal to a Board of Appeal by a
|     Call for Appeal.  
| 
|     The Board of Appeal shall, upon finding that a Judicial Order is
|     improperly or invalidly executed, order that that Order be
|     amended or vacated, as it deems appropriate.  
| 
|     When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
|     for Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Clerk of the Courts shall
|     stay the Order under appeal.  If the Board of Appeals affirms
|     the validity of the original Order, it shall then vacate this
|     stay.
| 
| Chapter 5: Appellate Orders ------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Appellate Orders are executed by being sent to the Clerk of the
      Courts by the Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals, but do not
      take effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.
      The Lead Justice shall certify in eir submission to the Clerk of
      the Courts that the Order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
|     failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.  

|     The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
|     soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
|     which executed it.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
|     judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
|     provided, the Justiciar shall vacate the Order which was
|     accompanied by that false certification.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Since Appellate Orders cannot be appealed, Appellate Orders are
|     valid only if addressed to:
|       a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
|       b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
|          Capacity; 
|       c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
|          convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
|          that particular CFJ; or
|       d) any combination of the above.
| 
|     All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.  
| 
|     This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
|     validity of Appellate Orders.
| 
| Chapter 6: Administrative and Private Orders -------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by
      a CFJ, the statement of which Statement alleges that the Order
|     is improperly or invalidly executed.  
| 
|     Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
|     was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
|     vacate that Order.  
| 
|     When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
|     for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
|     Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original
|     Order, e shall then vacate this stay.

| Chapter 7: Noncompliance with Orders ---------------------------------

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     An Order is satisfied when the action which it requires to be
|     performed is performed by the entity it requires to perform it.
|     (Only Orders which require an entity to perform an action can be
|     satisfied.)  Any entity who is required by an Order to perform
|     an act who fails to perform the required action prior to the
|     time specified in the Order commits the Crime of Contempt by
|     Inaction, a Class C Crime.

|     Except when otherwise specified, a single action can result in
|     the satisifaction of at most one Order.  If an action would
|     satisfy more than one Order, and no other specification is made,
|     the Action satisfies the oldest Order which it would satisfy.

|     This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
|     which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
|     the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
|     under this Rule.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Any entity who, while required by an Order to refrain from
|     performing an action, performs the proscribed action while the
|     Order is in effect commits the Crime of Contempt by Action, a
|     Class C Crime.
| 
|     This Rule shall have no application with respect to any Order
|     which has been adjudicated to be invalid, and the invalidity of
|     the Order is a complete defense to a Criminal accusation made
|     under this Rule.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1551 be amended, by replacing
| "Injunction" with "Order".
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rules 663, 1571, and 1573 be repealed.
| [Judicial Orders cover everything that Injunctions cover.]
| 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| Title II: Crimes, Infractions, and Criminal Judicial Procedure
| 
| Chapter 1: Crimes ----------------------------------------------------
| 
| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:
| 
|     Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be a
|     Crime, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
|     defined by the Rules to be a Crime, shall be subject to whatever
|     penalty the Rules prescribe for that Crime upon the execution of
|     a Sentencing Order executed consequent to a judicial finding
|     that e did in fact commit that Crime.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:
| 
|     The imposition of penalties for the commission of a Crime shall
|     be by Sentencing Order(s).  Upon a judicial finding that an
|     entity has committed a Crime, the Judge so finding shall execute
|     Sentencing Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
|     by the Rules for that Crime.
| 
| Chapter 2: Infractions -----------------------------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
|     Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
|     defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
|     whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
|     Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.
| 
|     A Notice of Infraction stating that an entity has committed a
|     specific Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized
|     to report instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir
|     informed belief that the specified entity has committed the
|     specified Infraction.  A Notice of Infraction shall also specify
|     the penalty to be imposed for that Infraction.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     The imposition of penalties for the commission of an Infraction
|     shall be by the execution of a Notice of Infraction.  The Player
|     executing the Notice of Infraction shall, at the time e does so,
|     also execute Orders sufficient to implement the penalty required
|     by the Rules for that Infraction.
| 
| Chapter 3: Restrictions on Interpretation ----------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
|     
|     The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
|     specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
|     Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
|     which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
|     as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     No action is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by
|     the Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
|     Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
|     there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
|     be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
|     report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
|     be reported.
| 
| Chapter 4: Protection against Double Jeopardy ------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1652 be amended to read:
| 
|     No entity shall be subject to penalties more than once for a
|     single instance of a particular Crime or Infraction, any other
|     Rule notwithstanding.
| 
|     This Rule in no way bars the imposition of multiple penalties
|     for the same act (or failure to act) if such action (or
|     inaction) constitutes multiple Crimes, multiple Infractions, or
|     any combination thereof.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Any CFJ whose Statement alleges that an entity has, through
|     action or inaction, committed a Crime shall be dismissed if
|     there is a prior CFJ, the statement of which alleges that the
|     same entity has, through the same action or inaction, committed
|     the same Crime, and which was itself not dismissed.
| 
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| Title III: Currencies
| 
| Chapter 1: Transfer Orders -------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      If a Recordkeepor notes a transfer pursuant to a Transfer Order
      which is subsequently vacated, e shall correct eir records as
      soon as possible after the Transfer Order is vacated by noting a
      transfer which is the reverse of the transfer originally noted.
      However, if such a reversing transfer would result in an entity
      possessing a negative quantity of units of Currency, e shall
      instead execute a Payment Order requiring a Transfer Order that
      would have the same effect as the reversing transfer.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      The effect of noting a transfer on the records of the
      Recordkeepor is to remove the specified number of units of
      Currency from the holdings of the source entity and to add the
      specified number of units of Currency to the holdings of the
      destination entity.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their submission,
      and a complete record of all transfers noted upon eir records
      for at least four weeks.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be amended to read:

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1746 be repealed.  [Rule 1746 is
| redundant; a CFJ alleging that a Transfer Order is illegal would, if
| found true, result in the vacation of that Transfer Order, which would
| then trigger a reversing transfer or Payment Order under the revised
| Rule 1598, above.]
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1731 be repealed.  [Implicit
Transfer Orders are a pain, and exist only to support Voting.  The
conversion to paying for Votes after the fact eliminates the need for
this.]

| Chapter 2: Payment Orders --------------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      A Payment Order is only valid if a copy has been filed with the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in it, and takes effect
      no sooner than the time of such filing.  (Publishing the Payment
      Order in the Public Forum is sufficient to meet this
      requirement.)

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      if that Order has been satisfied, vacated, or both.  However,
      the Recordkeepor need only maintain records of satisfied or
      vacated Orders for four weeks after they have been satisfied or
      vacated.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended to read:
| 
|     Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment Order, e
|     shall do so within seven days of when the requirement arises.
| 
| [Rule 1599 is almost wholly redundant; the failure to execute a
| Payment Order falls within the scope of the amended Rule 1509.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be amended to read:

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency named in that Payment Order shall execute a new
      Payment Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with
      the payor and payee interchanged.

      If the Order vacating the original Payment Order is subsequently
      stayed or vacated, then the Recordkeepor shall stay or vacate
      the reversing Order required by this Rule.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1736 be repealed.  [Rule 1736 is
| redundant; a Judge's Order to pay Currency is a Payment Order in its
| own right.]
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1737 be repealed.  [Rule 1737 is
| redundant; Payment Orders are Orders subject to appeal according to
| the processes detailed above and can be vacated directly according to
| those procedures.]
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1733 be repealed.  [The automatic
| stay of Orders under CFJ renders Rule 1733 effectively redundant.]
| 
| Chapter 3: Debt ------------------------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| Title IV: Voting
| 
| Chapter 1: General Procedure -----------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of
      VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal).

      At the end of the Voting Period of a given Proposal, the
      Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a number of VTs equal to
      the cost of the Votes cast on that Proposal by that entity.

| Chapter 2: Debt Voting -----------------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      An entity for which, at the beginning of a given Nomic week,
      there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it as Payor
      which was executed originally for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals commits the Infraction of Debt Voting.
      This Infraction shall be reported by the Recordkeepor for Voting
      Tokens, and shall bear the penalty of the denial of Voting
      Privileges for a period of two weeks.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     A penalty denying Voting Privileges to an entity for a period of
|     time shall be imposed by ordering the Assessor to deny Voting
|     Privilege to the named Voting Entity for that period of time.
|     The denial of Voting Privilege begins with the beginning of the
|     first full Nomic Week after the Order takes effect, and
|     continues for the period specified.
|  
|     While the Assessor is ordered to deny Voting Privilege to a
|     Voting Entity, that Voting Entity shall be entitled to cast no
|     Votes on any Proposal, any other Rule to the contrary
|     notwithstanding.
| 
|     Any period of time during which an Order denying Voting
|     Privilege is without effect does not count toward the period of
|     denial.
| 
| Chapter 3: Voting Tokens ---------------------------------------------
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended, by replacing the
characters "Assessor" with "Banker" throughout, and by inserting the
following paragraph at the beginning of the Rule:

      There shall exist the Office of Banker.  The Banker shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| 
| Title V: Judicial Procedure
| 
| Chapter 1: Motions ---------------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
|     CFJ.

|     A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts,
|     clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

|     The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
|     to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
|     possible after receiving it.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
|     the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
|     received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
|     for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
|     sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
|     Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.  

|     The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
|     Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Judge to
|     perform as requested by the Motion. 

|     Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
|     the determination made and the reasons, if any, on the record of
|     the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the Motion of that
|     determination.  
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     Any Plauer may formally request a Judge issue any Judicial Order
|     by filing a motion requesting that Order.  If granted, the Judge
|     shall issue the Order requested.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1725 be repealed.  [If a Player
| feels that a Judge has omitted an Order, e may file a Motion
| requesting that that Order be issued, and may appeal the refusal of
| that Motion, if refused.]
| 
| Chapter 2: Orders to Annotate ----------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 789 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Rulekeepor
      to annotate the Rule in question with the Statement of that CFJ.
      Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of
      that Rule.  

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.
      Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way except as
      specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1500 be amended to read:

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that an SLC
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE,
      may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the Maintainer
      of that SLC to annotate the SLC in question with the Statement
      of that CFJ.  Such an annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.  

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.  Annotations to an SLC may not be modified in any
      way except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Maintainer of
      that SLC to remove the annotation in question.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended, by replacing
| "Injunction" with "Order".
| 
| Chapter 3: Orders to Compel ------------------------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1509 be amended to read:
| 
|     Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
|     duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
|     execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
|     soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
|     Compel.
| 
|     If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
|     holds a specific Office or other position of official
|     responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
|     position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
|     the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
|     Player be removed from Office or position.
| 
|     If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
|     Player in question holding a specific Office or official
|     position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
|     the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
|     perform that duty instead.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     The refusal of the Speaker to perform a duty when ordered to do
|     so by an validly issued Order to Compel constitutes being an
|     Impossible Speaker, as defined elsewhere.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
|     require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
|     virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
|     Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
|     judicial nature shall be dismissed.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted: 
| 
|     A CFJ alleging that the Clerk of the Courts has failed to
|     perform a duty of eir Office may, at the Caller's option, be
|     filed with the Justiciar, who shall then perform all the duties
|     of the Clerk of the Courts with respect to that CFJ.
| 
| Chapter 4: Formal Apologies ------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 908 be amended to read:

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player (herein called the Ninny)
      has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, the Judge so finding shall Order
      that Player to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.
      However, when the action (or failure to act) is subject to
      penalties by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, the Order is optional and may be issued at the
      Judge's discretion.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny in the Public Forum,
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology. 

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

|     The failure to abide by an Order to Submit a Formal Apology is
|     an Infraction carrying a penalty of 3 Blots, to be reported by
|     the Judge who issued the original Order.
| 
| Chapter 5: Appeals ---------------------------------------------------

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1564 be amended to read:

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
|     denial of any Motion, and the execution of any Judicial Order
|     are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.  In
|     addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
|     has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
|     required to perform.
      
      In all cases, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, is sufficient to initiate the appeal of a
      particular matter.  In the case of the appeal of a Judicial
      Order, the insistence of any Player bound by the Order is
      sufficient.  In the case of a Judgement which convicts a Player
      of a Crime, the insistence of the convicted Player is
      sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1695 be amended to read:

      In the appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board shall consider
      whether the Order in question was both legally made and
      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:
| 
|     The Lead Justice of a Board of Appeals is the Justiciar, if e is
|     serving on that Board, or the Player who serves in the place of
|     the Justiciar otherwise.
| 
| Chapter 6: Technical Corrections -------------------------------------
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1742 be amended by replacing the
| word "Injunctions" with "Orders".

What sort of services do you think should be publically funded,
by payment from the bank, and what sort of things should be paid for by
the individual users?
<<

I like the idea of more economic activity in that direction, but would
like to keep rule mandated documents like reports out of the
game. 

I'd prefer to think of officers and their rule mandated jobs as
something like civil servants. If we want to get an economic aspect in
here, I think we should introduce taxes that simply cover the banks
expenses for salaries. This would be easy: simply divide the sum of
all salaries paid out by the number of players, and bill every player
eir share of the total.

Private enterprizes like the Daily Agoran are a different matter - I
would certainly pay a good amount of currency for a subscription to
this. But that is a "free" enterprize - no rules needed. A private
agreement, possibly protected by the contract law, would suffive
here.

I think we should move into
an expansionary phase of development and attept to "take over" other
(newish) nomics by offering them a home in Agora, with their existing
rulesets as SLCs.  With a bit of luck both games might gain new
Players, and the interaction of different cultures might be quite
interesting.

Kolja is just the man to do this of course, as he is Ambassador.  Does
he think there are any suitable victim nomics out there? 
<<

I'm not sure I completely understand what you mean by "give a
home". Certainly the players of such nomics would have to join Agora
as players - why would they want to do that? 

I think developing IN into such a kind of supernomic would be a more
viable way to do this.

While I am enjoying the way IN developes at the moment, I would
appreciate getting some IN proposals with more "teeth".

Lawrence. 

It's a long time since I had to do this, but I think there's a unic
commend which enables me to change what the system thinks my name is,
yes? Eg, what people see when they finger gardner@silas. What is that
command? 'Mr S L Gardner' is way too formal for me.

Sigh. I tried it. It'll let me change everything but my name. I'll
probably have to ask a sysadmin to do it.

Do you really think so?  If the Rules are silent on the conflict between Rules
of different Power, isn't the criteria for solving such a conflict still well
defined?  What kind of game custom would be left behind in the wake of 1482's
repeal?  Isn't it Common Sense that a Rule of greater Power would win in a
conflict with one of lesser Power?  Would this repeal really have any effect on
the game at all (other than making more work for the Courts if someone forces
the issue)?

Why?  Power actually has three different functions as currently
defined: First, it represents the ability of a Rule to change
other Rules.  Second, it represents the resistance of a Rule
to being changed by other Rules.  Third, it determines precedence
between conflicting Rules.

There's no reason these three functions couldn't theoretically
be separated into three separate indices; therefore, I see
no reason that Power would continue to indicate a Rule's
precedence if 1482 were repealed.

In the absence of a Rule, what makes "Power" a better determinant
of precedence than Rule Number, or even Rule Title?
