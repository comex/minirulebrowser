Vlad responded to this (but I have lost the message, so I may be 
remembering it wrongl) claiming that either this would either mean 
than pay was better than expenditure on Duty to Vote, in which case
everyone would join, or it wouldn't, in which case no-one would.

This is not necessarily so. The first hald is true, if becoming a Soldier
necessarilty made any Player better off, I would expect all players to join.
But it does not follow that nobody would join otherwise. 

As I conceive it, joining the Army (I still like thinking of it as an 
Army, altho I admit that it is more of a public service group) will be
good for some Players and less good for others. It depends on your 
normal voting habits. In the past month or two, I have voted on nearly
every batch of proposals, in spite of never actually having a Duty to
Vote. I expect to continue that pattern. So joing the Army would be 
beneficial to me, even if it only meant a small increase in my income,
because it doesn't require any increase in my normal expenditure. 
Other players might not find themselves in the same position.

The other thing is that my design gives more pay to higher ranking 
Soldiers. So joining the Army may not initially pay off, but if you
managed to recruit some other players, or got yourself a promotion,
then you might find yourself closer to breaking even, or making a 
profit.

As to politics in the hierarchy, well that's the idea. But I think it
has potential to be more complex that Vlad anticipates. After all, to
get a Promotion, you need to eliminate a superior, and then be selected
by _eir_ superior as worthy of promotion. A commander is not likely to
promote a Soldier who is clearly after eir job, and it doesn't profit
a commander to have one of eir recruits thrown out of the Army. So you
can't just treat all your superiors as your enemies. Some of them would
have to be friendly, or else you're going nowhere.

The only problem I forsee is that not enough people will be interested 
in joining to make the Army an interesting venture.

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 11]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
          message sent, by any medium or combination of media, other
          than a medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every
          Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

      (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
          Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
          message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Forum to send
          such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
          Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
          that message.

The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the MUQ for VTs,
between 0 and 2 inclusive.  The Assessor may set the Voting Tariff to
any value in this range at any time by announcing the change in the
Public Forum; the change takes effect 72 hours after it is announced. 
Until the Promotor sets another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

AGORA NOMIC: You create a Rule giving each Player two Cows. Another 
Player finds a loophole which allows em to create for himself an 
infinite number of Cows, and turn the Milk into Voting Tokens, which
e uses to pass another Rule declaring em Grand Poohbah of All Agora.
The legality of this move is hotly disputed on the discussion list,
causing two Kudo Wars, one Writ of FAGE, and a stream of CFJs and 
Appeals which eventually prove that the original Proposal was not
properly submitted, and none of this actually happened.
