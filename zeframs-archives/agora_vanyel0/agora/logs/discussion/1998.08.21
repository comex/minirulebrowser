Well, it looks as if the Judge agrees with you, but I have to say that
we seem to have achieved a pretty ridiculous redefinition of what it
is to defer to a rule.  It seems that to really defer to a rule, in
the sense that I claim most people would understand it, we have to
carefully write our rule not to use the word "defer".

Interestingly, this discussion also suggests to me that our current
conflict resolution method would fail to resolve:

A: The value of Foo shall be 6, unless another rule states otherwise,
   in which case, that rule's specification of Foo's value shall hold.

B: The value of Foo shall be 5, unless another rule states otherwise,
   in which case, that rule's specification of Foo's value shall hold.

Any ideas on how this would pan out given the current ruleset?

Michael.

I don't know either!  I don't know what you're claiming.  If you're
claiming that I eventually assessed the penalties incorrectly, then
I'd say that's true in light of Murphy's judgement, though Harlequin
could confuse things by deciding your second CFJ was FALSE.  I guess
that all I'm claiming is that given my understanding of the rules at
the time, I did eventually assess the correct penalties. 

On a related note, what do you (addressing everyone in general)
suppose is the best course of action with respect to all of those POs
determined to have been issued incorrectly?  I have records of all the
POs I've issued, but determining which were issued in the manner that
we have recently decided was illegitimate, would be a considerable
task.  (The thought of doing it has inspired me to try and create an
Officer-holding time-line though..)

Michael.

As I see it, the only sensible interpretation is that conflict-avoiding
language is the same as deference.

The mirror-image interpretation seems sensible in any case as long as both
rules take precedence, both defer, or both try to avoid conflict as above.

It is only when only one Rule contains such a clause that precedence and
deference behave differently, because of the intuitive concept that any
rule can limit its own power (small p) but not automatically increase it.

In essence, deference may avoid conflict entirely, but may also fail in
this if the other rule attempts to defer in a reciprocal way.  I can also
envision a case of deference writing resulting in avoidance of conflict by
_both_ rules losing their effect - the reason why this doesn't happen in
your example is that the deference clauses explicitly say that the other
rule shall have effect.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I don't think it is proper to interpret the clauses above as deference
clauses in the sense of Rule 1030, because we're not dealing with
deference between Rules, but rather two Rules who (mutually) agree to
defer to each other's specifications.  It would be different if Rule
A, above, said "This rule defers to any Rules which states a different
value for Foo."  But that is not what it says.  This is deference on a
finer level than I believe Rule 1030 contemplates, and I don't believe
that our current Rules have much to say on this sort of deference.  I
suspect that the proper interpretation is to consider Rules A and B to
be in conflict, and given the absence of any explicit claim of Rule
precedence or deference, hold that whichever of the two is of lower
number holds.  But I am not wholly satisfied with this.  (The
situation may in fact be paradoxical.)

The way I read the rules, this would be a case where two rules conflict with
each other precisely because they both claim to defer to the other, so:

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

For the sake of argument, suppose A has a lower number.  Now we would have to
decide how to interpret the "winning" of a conflict.  Does it mean the "losing"
rule is treated as if it didn't exist?  In this case the value of Foo would be
6.  Or does it mean only those portions of the Rule which cause the conflict
are ignored?  In this case the value of Foo would be 5 - i.e. Rule B's
deference clause is ignored since it creates the conflict with A's deference
clause.  Interesting.  I suspect that we have always treated conflict
resolution in a way that retains as much of the "losing" Rules effects as
possible while eliminating the conflict, so I suspect the answer to the above
would be "Foo = 5".

Yes, I would have thought this was the sensible way of seeing things
as well, but one of the consequences of the CFJ Murphy judged seems to
be that we're not allowed to see the above rules as deferring to each
other after all.

My 2 cents.  I have a problem with the compound nature of this CFJ.  Although I
tend to agree that a deference clause does not *necessarily* prevent a conflict
from arising, I do not agree that such a clause "only" shows how to resolve a
conflict - nothing in the Rules, that I can see, prevents a Rule from deferring
to one with which it has no conflict.  So, at this point, I would consider the
first clause true, but the second one false, which, if I'm reading the Rules
correctly, means it should be dismissed.

I think a natural meaning for "undecided" would include failing quorum. 
However, the Rules only explicitly designate INP Referenda as "undecided" if
the AI is exactly one.  So I suppose you are right and we should add a fix for
this to one of the multiple fix proposals.
