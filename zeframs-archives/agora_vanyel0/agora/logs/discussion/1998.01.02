Wouldn't this tend to concentrate all the VT's into the hands of 
minimally-active players (those who cast one, and only one, vote per week)?  
Once 200 VT's were stagnant, no more would be distributed.

At least, we have to wait for the next official report of currencies from
each of the relevant recordkeepors, which would fulfill the requirements of
the rule.

Okay. I will wait and make one more attempt to settle Vanyel's estate. One.

The probate rules still do not impress me as making it very efficient to
complete even the most trivial estate.  Did the rule author mean to borrow
yet another "real-life" concept?

I saw these rules and thought that this might be the case, but
wondered at the first sentence of R402, which says that the transition
shall take place "whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to
become Speaker".  

I thought that this might take precedence, but I now agree that I was
mistaken.  This incidentally means that I was unable to make use of
the Speaker's Patronage.  I guess this means I should vacate that PO
to General Chaos.  (Doesn't it?)

Michael.

Note that the Recordkeepors of Irises and Frankenstein Monsters are
not obliged to report periodically.  They are, however, required to do
so now by Rule 1738.  (To the best of my knowledge, the RK of Irises
is the Vizier of the Order of the Evil Eye, and that of Frankenstein
Monsters is the Contestmaster of Swann's Frankenstein Contest.)

I haven't formally challenged any of the proposed Plans made to date,
nor do I intend to.  The foregoing reason is not sufficient, in my
mind, to make a formal challenge.  I do not object to the Plan you
have formulated, and do not plan to do so.  (You will note that an
objection of the sort I have raised is not one to which the Rule in
question grants validity.)

The problem is that it is hard--in fact, probably impossible--to write
a procedure which handles complex situations (which, because of the
recently adopted Organizational Payment Orders, may soon begin to
arise) properly, yet allows for speedy resolution of simple matters.

Oh, right.  The Distributor has no formal authority in this regard; I

It may not throw of the balance - I don't really think it improves it 
- but I don't understand the reason they should interfere. The cows 
may eat the farmer's fields, but what does the farmer do? Shoot the 
cows?

Anyone for renaming (possibly in a seperate proposal) Currencies to 
Commodities?

Hmmm. Being able to move your Plots, Without Objection, seems a bit 
silly. Is that the intent? If not, I suggest giving plots a location 
(cartesian coordinates) and basing Adjacency on that.

How do Organizations affect this?

I think that the rule that retrieves stranded Currency might 
interfere with this.

This seems like ugly wording ("... specifies that Mule to the 
Cartographor.")

Umm... how does the Mule's owner specify that it becomes working, if 
it's owned by a Plot?

Better make a Plot's Owner that Plot's Executor (this also solves 
the stranded currency problem).

Leftover "Structures" here.

This whole transfering a Mule to a Plot thing is starting to look 
uglier and uglier.

This means that each player can be self-sufficient (after Erg startup 
costs) producing 10 VTs and 1 P-Note per week, production 2 Ergs per 
week, and consuming 8 Ergs per month. Increase that production for 
cooperation reducing Erg costs, and increase it for a few Pastors, 
and everything looks well-balanced (not accounting for interacting 
Mules).

Looks good. I don't think this will change overall production 
radically, but it will make interesting strategy. You might even 
consider modifying Farmers in 1.0 VT increments.

Everything else looks good to me.

Agreed. As the original author of the Interaction rules (my main
contribution) I have to say that I thought the original adjacency rules
were more... logical.

This would certainly be appropriate considering the direction they've taken
of late.

This seems like a good idea to me. It also makes it easier for the
cartographor to deal with...

I'm not fond of this idea either. Personally, I liked "Structures" better
than "Mules," and I'd really prefer not to try to deal with the
non-fungible currency issue, not to mention the weird breaches of Pragmatic
Currencies we'll need to use to get the transferring going correctly.

I have to agree with others who have objected to making Plots and
Mules a Currency.  Currencies are meant to be fungible; quite
obviously, Plots and Mules are not.  There's a lot of stuff in the
Rules pertaining to Currencies that rely on the assumption of
fungibility that may cause problems with Plots or Mules as a Currency.

I would not consider the assignment of a Mule to a Plot to constitute
a change of ownership, but a change of Location.  That way, Player
might be able to rent out their Mules (gee, a use for that Agreements
Rule I created a while ago...).  Idle Mules have no Location.  (I also
agree that eliminating Location is a good idea.)

Has anyone put an effort into writing code to automate the production
cycle?

3. Do _not_ make Plots or Mules Currencies.  I think there are more
   pitfalls than benefits in this approach.  I don't see any problem
   with Ergs being a Currency, however.

4. A reminder: Proposals do not have the power to require Payment
   Orders or otherwise compel Players to perform actions.  Until this
   is fixed, you'll have to use a self-repealing Rule.

5. Define an Idle Mule as a Mule which has no Location.  Mules whose
   Location is a special Plot (see 2) are also Idle.

6. The production of Plots containing Working Mules goes to the owner
   of the Plot (not the Mule).  (However, possibly allow the owner of
   the plot to designate another entity to receive the production.)

7. Instead of destroying all of an owner's Mules if e fails to pay
   upkeep, keep track of which Mules have been paid for and which have
   not, and destroy those not paid for.  Allow anyone to pay for the
   upkeep of a Mule, not just its owner.  (These make rentals more
   interesting, and may even lead to the development of tort law when
   the lessee of a rented Mule fails to pay its upkeep as required by
   the rental agreement.)
