Has Harlequin returned a Judgement? If so, why has the Judgement not
been published? If not, why has the CFJ not been re-assigned? This CFJ
was distributed on Aug 21, over 2 weeks ago.

Welcome to the game, Proglet! (May I assume that is your nom de plume?)
The Backup list at yoyo is a designated Public Forum, and so your
request for registration was successful. However, the Backup list is
generally only used when the main lists at gecko are not working. I see
that you already subscribed to the gecko lists. Future posts should be
directed to them, as described in their respective welcome messages.

Good luck, and enjoy the game!

Steve

R1817 contains the key instruction: you are not required to note the
effects of TOs which result in the transferring Player possessing a
negative amount of Currency. Just ignore the TO.
<<

But what happens when the player acquires sufficient funds to make the
TO work later? Has the TO been destroyed? I think R1817 only allows
the Accountor to ignore the TO, not reject or vacate it. So when the
payoer gets more money, the TO is still around.

I guess that's why lee connected the problem with delayed TOs
(although a delayed TO in the sense of the rules explicitly contains a
well defined delay, in contrast to a temprarily unpayable normal TO).

Nor announced new elections.  I know, I know.  Hold your horses.  I
wanted to do the monetary things in one post, and the elections
(including Speaker replacement in the next).

Being of serene disposition, I was happy to give Harlequin two weeks
in which to return Judgement.  Being rather busy in the latter half of
last week and over the weekend with real life, and also with Revolt
based debate, I have not got around to re-assigning the CFJ.

In any case, by waiting for the Revolt to be judged a success, I now
get to ping Judicial time-wasters with fresh Blots and not have them
erased, muahaha.

Michael.

It seems to me that a Rebellious Player is necessarily also a Player.

It seems to me that the successful rebellion occurred while Murphy was
delegate ambassador. Now the job has reverted to me. But am I now
holding the position in the normal fashion or not? 1645 says that
after the period of delegation "the Delegating Player resumes holding
the Office, if e is permitted to do so". 

The effect of a rebellion (that players holding office in the normal
fashion cease to do so and hold it temprarily instead) only happens at
the time when the rebellion succeeds, so this never happened to me. So
am I now holding the office of ambassador temprarily or in the normal
fashion?

In case Proglet feels that making a Judgement so early after joining is
too difficult, I want to remind him that he can make himself ineligible as
a Judge for this, although it will cost him 0.5 Voting Tokens.

By the way, I thought this penalty was also reduced during the Grace
Period, but I apparently was wrong.  It seems like a good candidate for
something you would want to waive for inexperienced Players.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I have some question as to whether Proglet is eligible to be selected
as a Judge in this matter, since e was obviously not eligible at the
time the CFJ was called.  However, I have not had time to research the
law on this matter yet.

When I first saw Michaels stock market related way to determine a
random number I seemed to remember that in a very generic way this
production of random numbers from numeric values that appear in
"nature" is more difficult than expected, becasue there are claims
that even apparently innocent last digits of all kinds of numbers are
not really randomly distributed. 

I didn't mention this because I didn't remember any quotation, and the
idea sounds somewhat silly. However, I've just come across a recent
article in the statistical physics literature that discusses this
claim. It is publically available (as Latex or Postscript) from
<http://xxx.uni-augsburg.de/abs/cond-mat/9808305>

I'll try to read it this week.

Darn, why didn't you raise this question when I was selected for CFJ

Because I wasn't paying attention at the time? :)

I personally think the judicial assignment rules are in need of a
rewrite.  (Of course, I think that basically the entire ruleset is in
need of a rewrite, but that's nothing new.)

My report is done.  I expect that i have missed some TO's for debts.
Either that or many of us owe.  I will post the PI PO's soon.

Please COE as soon as possible.  If you can give me as precise detail
as possible so i can find the messages, I would appreciate it.  I am
eager to correct the mistakes.

OK, the basic laws of ASCII graphic:

1)  Use a fixed width font (when creating and when viewing.)
2)  Don't use <tab>s.

Anything else _will_ look completely different on another screen with
another font and tab stops.

Your problem seems to stem from (2).  Although when converting <tab>s to
spaces it is important to remember (1).

In Unix, the "expand" command is useful for this purpose.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

My reply: R1079 talks about what is required when the Rules
require "a random choice," not "one or more random choices."

Nope, that's not my understanding of a chi-square test.  As I
understand it, if a distribution fails a chi-square test at
a given confidence level, it means we can be certain, at that
confidence level, that the results are not random.  But if
a distribution passes a chi-square test, all it proves is that
the distribution is insufficient to conclude that the results
are non-random (or, at least not according to the predicted
probability.)

For example, suppose I have written a program to simulate the
throw of a six-sided die.  I run it many times, and the results,
in order, are:

123456123456123456123456123456123456....

Such a distribution will pass a chi-square test; it is a misaaplication
of the chi-square test to then conclude that the results are
random.

He should just take the data over the last week or two, which
would almost certainly pass a chi-square test.

In the normal fashion, I'd say. It's a bug we need to fix.

But my point is precisely that whether your regard the above situation
as the making of two choices each between 2 options, or as the making of
one choice between 4 options is a somewhat arbitrary matter.

We've certainly had case law on this subject (or at least similar
subjects) before. I'll see what I can find.

The question of the eligibility to be selected as Judge of persons
who were not Players at the time the CFJ was called was addressed by
Judge Michael in CFJ 1046, who needed to answer it in order to reach a
determination on a related question about eligibility of such persons to
serve as Justices. Michael's (quite sensible) answer is such persons are
not eligible.

Here's a repost of the CFJ.

======================================================================
CFJ 1046

Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ 933.

======================================================================

Judge:       Michael

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Andre
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Steve, timestamp lost
  Assigned to Michael, 1 Oct 1997 19:33:25 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged TRUE by Michael, 3 Oct 1997 16:50:35 +0100

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 911 states in part:

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

       iv) E was ineligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.

CFJ 933 was called on Aug 4, a week before Calabresi registered to
play. Calabresi was, therefore, ineligible to Judge the CFJ, and so
satisfies the criterion of R911(iv) for being ineligible to serve
as Justice.

Andre has argued that Calabresi was later eligible to serve as a
Judge when the CFJ was re-assigned after the initial Judge defaulted.
This is true, but it no way changes the fact that Calabresi was, at
one time, ineligible to serve as Judge, and so is ineligible to serve
as Justice. R911 does not say that a Player who was never eligible
to serve as Judge is ineligible to serve as Justice.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments: 

R911 spells out the conditions under which a Player is ineligible for
selection as Justice.  It is clear and undisputed by the Caller that
Calabresi doesn't satisfy conditions i, ii, iii or v.

The question remains: was Calabresi ineligible to Judge the original
CFJ?  If so, then they are ineligible to serve as Justice in the
Appeal of that CFJ by condition iv.

This question needs careful consideration.  In particular, what sense
are we to make of the "was" in condition iv?  

It's clearly ridiculous to claim that this refers to arbitrary
instants of time in history, as we were all ineligible to judge CFJs
before they were called, before we joined the game or before the game
started. 

In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated when a CFJ
is assigned a Judge.  

Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss the
eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to common-sense
and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not eligible as
Judges.   (The language of the Judge selection rule (R951) tells us
that Judges are to be selected from amongst eligible Players, not
necessarily implying that other classes of people are ineligible.
However, here the common-sense view of what it is to be eligible must
be appealed to, if it is impossible for one to be selected for
something because of one's status, this is equivalent to being
ineligible.)

Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the appeal
of CFJ 933.

Could i ask that someone please redistribute the CFJ to me 
(or tell me how to obtain a copy)? If noone does then i believe that 
I may be able to invoke Rule 1565/6 (Dismissal of a CFJ):

       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

If I make a reasonable effort to discover the statement (etc) of the 
CFJ, but fail, I cannot make a determination of the truth or 
falsity of it!

thanks, i now have the cfj
(it just arrived quite a few hours out of order with the other mail 
and hence I thought I had been assigned to it without being sent the 
mail)

sorry for any confusion.

The CFJ in question would appear to me to only deal in the case 
of the selection for an appeal, as Rule 911 appears to me to 
only concern selection of a Board of Appeals.

Unless there is some other CFJ, i would guess that I am 
eligable.

Judge's Argument:

The caller stated that:
>
> The rule Rule 1837/0 (Power=1) does not mention a Revolt, just a
> rebellion.

Which is true, but irrelevant, because 1837 was amended on Aug 3 1998
to read:

Rule 1837/1 (Power=1)
The Miscreant

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscreant.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another
      Player gains more Blots than em.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious
      Players when determining the outcome of a Revolt. This rule
      takes precedence over any other rule determining the outcome
      of a Revolt.

The rule now explicitly mentions "the outcome of a Revolt", and has
the necessary precedence clause to change the method described in
1664.

The question still stands as to whether the Miscreant is counted
twice when determining "the number of Players at the time of the 
Call for Revolt", required by R1664. Does counting the Miscreant as 
"two Rebellious Players", mean counting em as two players for the
total?

In the absence of any other ruling discovered by this judge, either 
in the ruleset or in the history of past judgements, the decision
comes down to one of common sense. It seems to me, necessary that
being counted as two Rebellious Players, also implies being counted
as two Players. R1664 makes it clear that both the selection of the
random integer, and the comparison to the number of Rebellious Player
are part of determining the outcome of the Revolt, so the last
paragraph of R1837 affects them both. Swann, as the Miscreant, was
therefore correctly counted twice, both for the number of Players
and the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Revolt.
