Rule 1859 does preclude sending them to anyone else:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
                              ^^^^
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.)

I encourage people to nominate for the post of Scorekeepor.  There
haven't been any nominations to date. 

I also encourage Speaker Steve to decide the Justiciar and Wizard
elections. 

Michael.

I like that; it would make the Justiciar much more interesting ;) 
without adding significantly to the light workload which is the 
Office's main attraction. A note as to the mechanism, though -
having two opportunities for an appeal for leniency to fail (one
by the Justiciar's denial, one by some other Player objecting) is
too much. It would be better to eliminate the WO and suitably
restrict the Justiciar's authority to vacate POs resulting from an
Infraction, by amount, by period, or by some other means.

I moved email accounts and loft the report.  I thought it was you, but
I got a little panicky that I would be late in my judgement.

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.

I join Oerjan in calling for the Appeal of CFJ 1101. I am of the
opinion that "specific" and related terms, as used in the Ruleset and
with the meaning that previous Game Custom have imparted to these
terms, do not necessarily imply exact, individual specification of
an existing and narrowly identified entity. The issue seems to be
more of whether ineligibility involves properties of Nomic Entities,
which the Caller drew attention to and has not IMHO been adequately 
adressed by the Judge.
