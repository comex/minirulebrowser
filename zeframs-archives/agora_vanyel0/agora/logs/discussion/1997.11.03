I differ. Absent Rule 1728, the phrase 'Without Objection' may be 
regarded as defining a procedure, if its natural meaning is adequate 
for that purpose.

This is too simple. I can do that in a matter of seconds using the emacs
search-function. If you want to do something like this, then let the
exact form of the errors not be known on beforehand.

Hmmm... Still doesn't work - just a Unix 'diff' would solve that.

Again, this time to the Public Forum:

Admitted. The relevant part should read:

                               CFJ 1064

"Words and phrases which have received judicial construction before
enactment are to be understood according to that construction."[1] It
seems to me that this canon also suggests that once a word or phrase
has been given a peculiar construction by statute, that the repeal
(or, in this case, suspension) of the statute which gave it that
construction does not perforce deprive that word or phrase of that
peculiar construction.

Unfortunately, the first proposal I have in my archives is 3542.  This is the
first one I received upon taking office as Promotor.  The proposals you are
interested were handled by the previous Promotor.  I can take a look at
Vanyel's archives at some point, but this may take some time, since I have
limited access to the Web at this point.

Vanyel's archives are themselves of limited utility; apparently a good
chunk of them didn't survive the move to Brown.  I was Promotor for
Proposal 3541, and it was Disinterested by virtue of being Proposed
after Proposal 3533 took effect and nuked P-Notes.  However, Proposals
3534 through 3539 were all Proposed before Proposal 3533 took effect,
and thus may or may not be Disinterested, depending on whether their
fees were paid.  I _think_ Andre was Promotor then, but I may be
mistaken.

Hm, I finally found the distribution message in my logs, and a
contemporaneous Proposal Note report.  It appears that 3534 through
3539 were in fact Interested, which means I shall have to vacate some
of the Orders I recently issued.  Oh well.

But your previous message does not fit its natural meaning.  The
natural meaning of Without Objection is that an opportunity
was available for people to object, and no one did so.  Your
message did not allow any opportunity for people to object.

You know, I'm nowhere near being in law school, yet somehow between
Agora and the intellectual freedom class I'm taking this semester,
I find myself going to the Law Library here on campus quite a bit. :)

A moral obligation, perhaps, but not a legal one.

Good point.  This needs closer examination.  I too call for the appeal of this

Not quite true.  A person *cannot* register to play Agora under the hypothesis
without depositing the money.  It is true that there is no legal obligation to
play Agora, however, if one *wishes* to become a Player, then one is legally
obliged to deposit the money in order to become registered.

What we are running into here is this artificial distinction between a Player
and a person who is "playing Agora".  IMO, it is a meta-game principle that the
Rules have authority over all persons, registered or not, who seek to interact
with them, at any time during this interaction (playing the game).  We have set
up a special class of persons, called Players, over whom we have decided to
give the Rules authority at *all* times (while they are Players), and to whom
the Rules grant special privileges.  However, this does not deprive the Rules
of their (meta?) authority over non-Players, whenever such a non-Player seeks
to do something within Agora that is regulated by the Rules.  It is, of course,
part of the fun and games to craft the Rules in such a way that regulations of
interactions by non-Players can be successfully enforced (not too hard in an
e-mail based game).

I believe that without an Agoran definition, the proper "natural"
interpretation would be that in Robert's Rules, as nearly as could
be applied to Agora.

In Robert's Rules, the chair is allowed to declare a motion (usually
a simple procedural motion) passed "without objection" if e believes
it would passs unanimously.  However, since this is conducting business,
a quorum must still be present before e can do this.  I think you
would have to establish that a quorum of players had seen your
message and not objected before you could effect such a change.

(This is if we accept that with the infection of 1728 as causing
"Without Objection" to be interpreted "naturally".  I'm not sure
how I feel about that.)

                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This added phrase completely changes the meaning here.  I still maintain
that such a Rule imposes no legal obligation on the person who
wishes to become a player.

Charles> A moral obligation, perhaps, but not a legal one.

I don't see it as a moral obligation at all.  A moral obligation is
one imposed by (normative) societal mores, such as the moral
obligation imposed on men not to leer at women as they pass on the
street, or the moral (and legal, in France) obligation to render aid
to people in distress.  I don't see how the obligation imposed by
Steve's hypothetical rule upon prospective players has the slightest
moral character; I cannot envision a reasonable theory of morality
where attempting to register as a Player, with or without first making
a bank deposit in a specified account, is other than basically morally
neutral.

As an aside, I am almost certain that somebody has adapted Robert's
Rules for use in assembly meeting via telecommunication systems.
Robert's Rules are not very amenable to assemblies which conduct all
of their business through delivered messages, largely because the
concept of quorum is very hard to translate.

And, again, we end up debating how long we have to wait to decide that
a member is actually not objecting, as opposed to simply not being
aware of the motion in the first place.  Certainly, there must be a
reasonable time after which objections need not be entertained, but I
cannot say that there is a hard and fast rule as to what that time
might be.  I doubt I would accept anything under three days.

Charles> (This is if we accept that with the infection of 1728 as

Charles> I'm not sure how I feel about that.)

I don't think it has that effect; I think that it is improper to
construe the phrase "Without Objection" (as it appears in Rules other
than Rule 1728) without considering the fact that the Rules have, from
time to time, imposed a specific construction upon that phrase.
Especially significant, in my opinion, is that that particular
construction was mandated at the time each extant Rule which uses it
was enacted into its present form.

Chuck, is it safe to assume that you reach this conclusion from Rule
101 and the canon _expressio unius est exclusio alterius_ (expression
of the one is exclusion of the other)?  Are you arguing that, by
binding Players to its authority, Rule 101 also implicitly denies its
authority over all non-Players as well?

(I note that this particular canon has a poor history in Agora, and in
fact is probably entirely invalid in our jurisprudence.)

I should note that some of these Infractions were reported against the
wrong entities.  For example, when you reported Infractions against
Blob, you should have instead reported them against eir
Executor-in-Probate, Elde.  Similarily for Elde; those Infractions
adhere to Morendil.  There may be others I'm not aware of.

Secondly, Infractions only apply to Players.  "A Player shall be
subject to the penalty for an Infraction..."  Says nothing about
non-Players.  Thus, it is improper to apply the penalty for an
Infraction with respect to an Infraction reported against a
non-Player.  You can report the Infraction, but you cannot impose the
penalty.  (IMO.)

I'd COE on this, but it's somewhat irrelevant and I don't want to
force you to waste the time reversing all the improperly reported
Infractions.

I note that I called a CFJ on just this interpretation of 101, and in fact
used the current hypothetical charging of money in part of the arguments.
It was found TRUE.

Does anyone have the final copy of the Judgement?
(I probably have the original CFJ if anyone's interested.)

No, that is not necessary for my conclusion, and in fact I do
not endorse that principle.  (I believe that the Rules have
no moral authority over non-Players, as a metagame principle--that
is to say, if I were not a Player, I would not feel any obligation
to obey the Rules--but there is nothing in any Rule, 101 included,
which prevents Rules from imposing legal obligations on non-Players.)

Actually, I think the way I figured them was correct, but I didn't bother to
make it explicit in my message.  Of course, I could easily have made some
mistakes.

I think you are correct here.  I had read the Rules too quickly, trying to get
this over and done with.

Thanks, I appreciate this, since they are all vacated anyway.

Re: DIS: Re: OFF: Elections

Regarding the hypothetical registration deposit, correct me if I am wrong,
Chuck, but I think you are pointing out the difference between a legal
*obligation* and a legal *requirement*.  I agree with this, a non-Player is not
obligated by the Rules to do anything, but e may be *required* by the Rules to
do something in order to do something else regulated by the Rules.

It isn't irrelevant to me, as 1743 is not repealed until its
other requirements are fulfilled.

Hmm, what does 'cat ruleset.txt | grep reasonable' output... How about
one hour ? One day ? Two weeks is obviously reasonable. ;)

As an Agora Platonist through many of our debates, I consider Plato a
house hold name in Agora.

You just have to think of other nice phrases:

"Suber doesn't have the faintest idea ..." instead of "... knows ..."
"Suber not having any say in this ..." instead of "... willing ...,"
"Suber doesn't care, but ..." instead of "For the love of ...,"

AFAIK, the penalties for unreported Infractions were assessed against the
appropriate entity, EiP or otherwise.  Any COE on this portion would just make
me change the reporting line, but not the POs themselves.  That is to say, all
unreported PI Infractions have now been reported (although some of them may
have been reported incorrectly, about which R1743 says nothing).  As for the
second objection, this would only have forced me to vacate certain of the POs
when I admitted the COE - but of course they have been vacated anyway.  Barring
someone else stepping in with a COE that forces me to issue an Infraction that
I missed, I think you are safe in assuming that the requirements for repeal
have been met when you issue your next SLR.

I agree that two weeks would be a sufficiently reasonable time,
although I would probably also admit several shorter times.  One hour
is clearly too short, and one day probably also.

This is certainly far from a rigorous argument, but the Rules seem to 
favor a period of one week as the minimum time requirement to be placed 
on actions. (I've always kind of thought that one could get away playing 
Agora only checking mail once per week).

I thought the above was what you are arguing against. If not by the sort

Proposal 3579 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Stranded Currencies 

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be created with the following
text:

      The Chancellor is empowered to submit Transfer Orders for any
      entity which lacks an Executor, as if e were the Executor of
      that entity, but may do so only as specified by this Rule.

      Whenever there exist units of any Currency in the possession of
      any entity which neither has an Executor nor is in Probate, the
      Chancellor shall (as soon as possible after being made aware of
      this condition) execute Transfer Orders transferring all such
      Currencies to the Bank.

======================================================================
Proposal 3580 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Improper Transfers

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.
      
      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

======================================================================
Proposal 3581 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3582 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal-O-Matic

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

======================================================================
Proposal 3583 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeals Without Objection

     All Players are Empowered to Repeal any Rule over which this Rule 
     takes precedence, Without Objection.

     This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules.

======================================================================
Proposal 3584 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Free-for-All

Let the following rule be created (Title: Duty-Free Days):

     Any Speaker shall have the Right to declare Duty-Free Days if e has 
     not yet done so since e assumed the Speakership.  This Right is 
     exercised by the Speaker making an announcement in the Public Forum 
     that includes the following information:

       i) A declaration that Duty-Free Days are about to begin.
      ii) The time that these Duty-Free Days shall be initiated.
     iii) The duration that the Duty-Free Days shall be in force.

     To be a valid declaration, the time of initiation must occur 
     between 72 hours and one week after the Speaker's announcement.  In 
     addition, the duration of the Duty-Free Days shall be no less than 
     48 hours, and no more than one week.

     While Duty-Free Days are in force, all fees and/or payments that 
     the Rules require of the Players shall be suspended.  The Players 
     may only be assessed fines due to Crimes and Infractions, any other 
     activity for which the Rules require a payment may be performed by 
     the Players at no charge.  This rule takes precedence over all 
     Rules that require payments by the Players.

{Comment: This is another toy for the Speaker.  It serves two purpouses.
          1) A blatant source for political power.
          2) An emergency recovery mechanism in case of economic
             collapse.}

======================================================================
Proposal 3585 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Abolish P-notes by making the following rule changes:


1727: replace the string "one P-note each from the Bank to each Player
who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's BIrth" (in the last
paragraph but two of version 2 of this rule) by "one Voting Token each
from theBank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during
Agora's Birthday"

replace the string " and shall pay out to each such Contest 5
VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each" (in the last
paragraph but one of version 2 of this rule) by "and shall pay out to
each such Contest 5 Voting Tokens."


1451: in the first sentence of the second paragraph, "The Assessor
shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one P-Note.", replace "one
P-note" with "two Voting Tokens".

[It might be simpler to repeal this rule altogether, but then 1065
becomes kind of useless.]


947: replace the string "the Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the
Proposer of that Proposal." by "the Rulekeepor shall pay out one
Voting Token to the Proposer of that Proposal."


1678: replace the string "If an Interested Proposal passes," by "If a
Proposal passes,"


1047: replace the string "When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some
Player" by "When a Proposal Proposed by some Player".

replace the string "the Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that
Player." by "the Assessor shall pay out one Voting Token to that Player."


1705: replace the string "the Wizard shall pay out to each Player with a
positive Style Point rating a number of P-Notes
equal to half their Style," by "the Wizard shall pay out to each
Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of Voting Tokens
equal to a third of their Style,"

Change the title of 1705 to "Voting Tokens for Style".


1723: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested", and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three."


1724: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested" and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by
two.

[Question re 1723 and 1724: should a price for making such proposals
reintroduced? How can that be done without keeping the whole petition
fee mechanism just for this purpose?]


1036: replace the string "accompanied by its Number, the identity of
its Proposing Entity, and a clear indication of whether the Proposal
is Disinterested." by "accompanied by its Number and the identity of
its Proposing Entity."


1729: replace the string "An Interested Proposal is Insane," by "Any
Proposal submitted is Insane,"

[Anyone have a better change? I tried to preserve the meter, though
there isn't a clear metric structure of this rule, anyway.]

---

Repeal the following rules:

833 (Awards & Penalties for Proposals)
1583 (Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players)
1701 (Proposal Notes)
1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals)
1623 (Disinterested Proposals)

---

[Comment:

On some occasions P-note rewards or fees are replaced by VT awards,
e.g. 1727, 1451.

In some of these cases I have reduced the amount of VTs, because I
think they are more valuable than P-Notes used to be. Maybe this
could be done even more rigorously.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3586 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Pardons
Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players. The
Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic month, and may not
Pardon the same Player twice in a given term of office (although, if re-elected
later, he may again Pardon that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a
Player by announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
following events may occur:
      1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to eliminate
all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player, and the Herald shall do
so as soon as possible.
      2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any Payment
Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned Player's estate in order to
reduce the number of Blots possessed by the Player's estate to below the
threshhold for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X number
of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number of Indulgences would
suffice to render the Player no longer Lawless.
      3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player may
immediately reregister.
      4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to ten
Prescribed Words in his Pardon.
      5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during this period he must
apply all Indulgences received (from any source) to his debt and may not
transfer them to another Entity.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or Persistent
Indebtedness.

[I was going to originally make this a prerogative of the Speaker, but
Swann's Proposals would already give the Speaker much power and anyway, to CotC
is not paid enough :-)]

======================================================================
Proposal 3587 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Reduce Frivolous Appeals

Amend Rule 1447 by appending the following paragraph:

      If a Judgement, Dismissal or Injunction is Appealed, and the Board
of Appeals unanimously upholds the original Judgment, Dismissal or
Injunction, then the Player or Players who initiated the Appeal have
committed the Infraction of Frivolous Appeal, detected and reported by the
CotC, which carries a penalty of one Blot.

[I think Appeals are too readily made. This seems like a relatively
simple and, hopefully, uncontroversial way to address that problem.]

(Title: Awards for InterNomic Proposals)

     A Player who submits an InterNomic Proposal shall receive the 
     following awards based upon the results of that InterNomic 
     Proposal.  The Ambassador shall pay out these awards as soon as 
     possible after e announces the results of the InterNomic Proposal.

       i) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, and Agora did 
          not vote FOR it, there is no award.
      ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora did 
          vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
     iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award 
          shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

     In addition, if the adoption of the InterNomic Proposal directly 
     results in Agora receiving enough InterNomic points to win a game 
     of InterNomic, the Player who submitted that InterNomic Proposal 
     shall Win the Game (of Agora).

      Players are permitted to submit InterNomic Proposals, which are
      distinct from Proposals in Agora, by sending to the Ambassador
      a text which is clearly intended to become an InterNomic
      Proposal. If a Player does so, the Ambassador shall be required
      to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance
      to InterNomic procedures.

      In no case shall such submission, or the distribution by the
      Ambassador of text clearly labeled as InterNomic Proposals cause
      the Proposing of Proposals in Agora, any Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

[Explanation:
Removes the restriction to one IN Proposal per Player per week,
disinfects the Rule (it still contained the old Virus sentence!),
and improved the wording.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3594 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Shorten InterNomic Voting Period

Amend Rule 1632 (InterNomic Voting Procedure) by replacing the phrase

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until one week before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

by:

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until 72 hours before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

with

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote

There are some things that the Rules require be done within 72 hours
(such as abiding by an Injunction).  However, I am not aware of any
circumstance under which a Player can be required to do something in a
shorter time that don't involve the end of a Nomic Week.

Thus, I am certain that no time less than 72 hours would be
reasonable, and reasonably confident that a time of a week or more
would be.  For the interval between 72 hours and one week, I am
undecided.

These Proposals were all Disinterested. They were the first Proposals
distributed after P3533, which destroyed all P-notes.

Why isn't it a legal obligation? It's a conditional obligation, I grant
you - they're only required to do it if they wish their attempt to be

It's pretty weak game custom though, and Michael supports his overturning

Incorrect; Proposal 3534-3539 were distributed before the announcement
of P3533's results.  Proposals 3534-3539 were distributed 11 July 1997
at 18:29:47 UTC.  Proposal 3533's results were announced 15 July at
20:01:55 UTC.

That would be one reasonable time to pick as the minimum reasonable
time needed. I think an argument could also be made for 3 days, or
for 4 days.
