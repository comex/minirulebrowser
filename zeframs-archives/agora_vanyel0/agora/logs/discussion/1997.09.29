As soon as I heard about it from the list, I went and checked it out.
Looks very interesting. The significance of November 23 for the book is a
bit spooky, though...it's my birthday.

1069 may not be able to count the transformations as they occur, but that
doesn't mean it can't count them after (or even before) the fact.

I was thinking, what an honor it must be for the person picked to

It's no good trying to save the atomic view by trying to make its
pronouncements always match those of the provision-by-provision view:
the whole point of the atomic view is that it's supposed to give a
*different* outcome in the case of P3533 - one where VTs were not
destroyed.

It's true that you can posit, say, an internal counter which counts the
number of amendments to a Rule, which Rule 1069 then consults after the
Proposal has taken effect to see what the new Amendment Number should be.
But then you can also posit an internal "Mintor of VTs destroyed" flag,
which will get set to true while P3533 is taking effect, and which R1579
consults after it has done so. What's sauce for the goose is sauce for
the gander.

But in fact, you can't really posit either thing on the atomic view.
In Scott's words, intermediate states are too fleeting to have any
legal significance. These mechanisms give legal significance to 
intermediate states and are therefore inimical to the atomic view.

Actually, I think "best interests of the game" is the best thing to be
added to the Rules since the beginning of Agora. There is no reason why a
crash might not be "in the best interests of the game".

Grmbll.... That's going to cost you the Kudo I just transferred to you.
Suppose the Judge does NOT agree with you. In that case e has to check
ALL COEs General Chaos has denied since the Crime of Wrongful COE denial
was first defined. You should have added the something specifying the
wrongfully denied COE in your Statement.

Even if they are severable, I don't see why you are interpreting 

  "Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
   ignored." 

as meaning "Provisions which are *individually* unclear, ... "

It seems to me that 594 has as much scope to bring down provisions in
a group as one by one.

Certainly.  But these provisions are not "unclear, ambiguous, or
inapplicable" and 594 would not try to prevent their implementation.

Several repeals, plus two rule creations.  All these are applicable.  The
ruleset is broken at the end, but at least it is clearly and unambiguously
broken.  :-)

I agree.  

Game custom has finally come down on the side of the non-atomicists.

Unless other more compelling factors come into the equation (I'd make
a push for "best interests of the game" myself :-), the Justices
should clearly uphold the decision in CFJ 933.

Incidentally, one *could* phrase the rules on the generation of
amendment numbers in such a way as to give us the same result as that
which holds now, and still have atomicity.  

In particular, my view of how the world should be (rather than *is*,
of course :-), does not preclude an examination of a proposal to
determine things like how many provisions a proposal contains which
amend a given rule.

This is akin to the debate on the difference between the programs 
  X = 2 * X;  X = X + 1;
and
  X = 2 * X + 1;

In most programming languages these two fragments are semantically
identical, but they do differ syntactically.   One could tell them
apart by counting the number of assignment statements, but not by
comparing their effects.

A line in the sand indeed.  That doesn't stop us being certain on which
side of the line some wordings lie.  "X is doubled, and then incremented
by 1" is clearly two events ("then" is unambiguous).  "set X to 2X+1" is
clearly one event (there is only one verb and one object).  "Repeal Rules
2000 and 2001" or "All Players receive 10 Points" are borderline cases,
but that's what the courts are for.

I suppose an apology is in order; I cannot deny that the above CFJ, as
it stands, is very poorly framed - maybe it should even be dismissed as
vacuuous. I let my outrage get the better of me, which is never a good
idea.

Not necessarily.  I permit exceptions to general rules, as well; and I
think an exception for amendments to Rules is one that should be
admitted.  Rule Changes are "special", in my opinion, and deserve
exceptional consideration.  Changes to other things are not.

I will admit that I don't follow most of either yours or Michael's
recent discussions on these matters.

Actually you didn't transfer a Kudo to him, since in your message you 
stated you were transferring a 'V.T.' to him. I agree that the CFJ is 
poorly framed.

It is poorly framed, yes, but hardly vacuous. We can't just go around 
using that term to mean 'silly' or 'overreaching'; it specifically refers 
to a 'content-free' CFJ. Unfortunately there's no mechanism for 
retracting a CFJ; maybe the judge will agree with you; otherwise, e'll 
just have to decide the statement on its own merits.

Re: DIS: counting amendments under the atomic view

I agree, there is more than one kind of "atomicity" theory floating around
here.  But isn't the incrementing of amendment numbers just as much of an
indirect effect as the destruction of Currencies?

As far as I'm concerned, an amendment changes the Rule which it
amends.  This stuff about functions is highly amusing, but I pay it
minimal heed.  It's my position that intermediate states are not
visible because they are too fleeting in duration, not because they
are "mere calculational conveniences".  If this is inconsistent with
Michael's exposition, then it's inconsistent with Michael's
exposition.

I interpreted that to mean that that clause would fire upon the text "These
provisions must either both be implemented, or neither shall.", or
something to that effect.

I don't think this is fair. The number of amendments is a formal property
of the Proposal in question, like the number of words. I see no reason why
you can't count the number of amendments at any point, just as you can
receive the bonus for Repealing a long Rule after the fact. That has
nothing to do with whether or not VT's ever did not have a Mintor.

I think I'm thinking too much 'ideal' rather than 'actual' here.  In what I
would consider the ideal way of resolving proposals (namely the proposal I
proposed), the above would be true.  In the actualy way, it's much less clear.

You are correct.  It seems that this proposal was dealt with sequentially,
and I suppose I should concede the VT destruction argument, too, since that
naturally follows (and since the judgement has come back, so there's no use
arguing over it anymore).

The question, I believe, now turns to how proposals *should* be resolved.
I made a proto-proposal a few days ago that I plan on proposing as soon as
voting periods get fixed and VTs get re-minted.  I really didn't get much
feedback on it, though, which was my purpose for proto-ing it.

As a side note, does anyone have a copy of my proto?  I haven't yet decided
how to archive my Agora mail yet, so that got deleted accidentally.

Aren't they ambigous in that the provisions fail to define a consistent
method of determining rule precedence?

I don't think so.  The fact that it might be impossible to determine the
legality of some game move in the future doesn't make a provision to enact
a Rule ambiguous.

Enact the Rule means enact the Rule, with no reasonable alternative
interpretation.

That's the Rules which are ambiguous, not the Proposal. The Proposal is
pretty clear on how it changes the Ruleset.

It is not customary in Agora to consider effects of enacted Rules to be
effects of the Proposal. They may still be part of the intent, though:
consider the anti-bribing Rule 1003.

Greetings,
rjan.

Um, yes, I believe that at times it may be in the best interests

Maybe some orthography would clarify: 
I believe it can be in the best interests of the Game to crash the game.

And anyway, whether or not it's in the best interests of anything, it 
sounds fun to me. :)

I agree, but I think too many people might interpret "the best interests

Here it is:

--------------------------------------------------

Proto-proposal:
[by Vir, reposted here:]

===
Rule 594 is amended to read:

When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its Adoption Index,
and the provisions contained in the text of the Proposal are implemented
sequentially on an exact duplicate of the Game State and to the maximal
extent permitted by the rules.  While these provisions are being
implemented, the Rules may have no effect on the game state other than
preventing a provision from being applied to it.  Provisions which are
unclear, ambiguous, inapplicable, or base their applicability upon later
provisions are ignored.  After all of the provisions in the Proposal have
been processed in this way, the Game State becomes the duplicate of the
Game State which all of the provisions were applied to unless the Proposal
has been determined to have no effect as described in the Proposal.

For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted Proposal is a
legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value requested
by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for that Proposal by the
Rules (if any).
===

The "unless the Proposal has been determined to have no effect as 
described
in the Proposal" is meant so that proposers may add the clause "If any
provision of this Proposal are not implemented, this Proposal has no 
effect."

Is that unclear in any way?

The Rules themselves are ambiguous, but the Rule Changes in the Proposal
are not.  594 prohibits the latter, not the former.

Yuck.

Rule 3000: "A Player's Style can never be negative.  Any change that
would make it negative instead makes it zero."  A perfectly reasonable
wording, but would it prevent a provision "elJefe's Style is set to -3"
taking effect?  What if a Rule refers to itself in order to determine
legality, and is repealed by a Proposal?

I don't think it is possible to satisfactorily distinguish Rules that
"prevent a provision being applied" from any other kind of Rules.
But there might be a better way based on this: remove the exception for
preventing a provision being applied, and make that prevention apply
when the whole Proposal is applied in the last step.  Separability gets
a little more complex in theory, but if you're careful about the wording
then in practice it shouldn't ever get too messy for the courts.

One other thing: what about game state changes that occur while the
Proposal's provisions are being applied to the parallel game state?
The only one of any consequence is the processing of the Proposal itself
-- you might want to clarify that in the parallel game state the proposal
has already been applied, otherwise you'd get a loop.

That's their perogative, isn't it? If that's the majority opinion, I'm not
going to contest that.

Who said anything about majority opinion?  Let me rephrase: I think
one person (not any one person in particluar) might interpret
"the best interests of the game" to mean "no crashing."

If it *is* the majority opinion that "the best interests of the game"
means "no crashing," then perhaps they should be more explicit about
it in 217, since there are at least a few Players who thing TBIOTG
can sometimes mean crashing the game.

I'm sorry; I wrote nothing of the kind. I haven't really entered this 
debate; I don't feel familiar enough with the issues at hand yet. So

I'm confused; a P-note is held by itself? Is thing something from before

Yes.  Someone noticed that when we got rid of Treasuries, there was no
specification left as to which entities could own Currencies.  So Andre
illustrated the point by granting one of eir P-Notes its freedom.  8)

That's delightful! I hope it's happy and not too lonely, and I do hope 
that if there is currency reform, this bravely independent P-note 
survives it. :)

This may not be true.  If VTs were destroyed, then the Proposal which
ratified P-Notes was not adopted.  Furthermore, the same logic by
which VTs are said to have been destroyed surely causes P-Notes and
Indulgences to also have been destroyed....

I know, but I'm waiting for the result of CFJ 933 to be officially posted
before I change to the new game state from the old one.

However, it is my understanding that Indulgences were not destroyed because the
rule that established them as a Currency has higher precedence than the rule
that attempted to destroy them (which was not true for VTs or P-Notes).  There
is a CFJ, I can't recall its number, which established this.

Not at all.  The Amendment Number is a derived property of a Rule; it
changes when the Rule is changed, without any further "operation" or
"action".  

The purported destruction of VTs is disanalogous.  If we were to argue
that the "effect" were to set the "destroyed" property of each VT to
"true", I might accept that.  But just as Michael repudiated the idea
of "destroyed Currencies" in a recent Judgement, I also repudiate the
idea that there can exist "destroyed units of Currencies".  Rather, I
believe that Rule 1579 creates an underspecified obligation to destroy
the units of those Currencies if and when their Mintor ceases to exist
or ceases to have the Authority to be a Mintor.  This obligation is
not fulfilled until someone or something acts upon it.

(We have discussed underspecified obligations in the past; an analogy
is "The coffee pot shall be turned off each evening."  This rule does
not assign the duty of turning off the coffee pot to anyone in
particular, but the coffee pot is required to be turned off,
nonetheless.  Underspecified obligations are problematic, but not
illogical.)

Now, some Players will argue that the Rules themselves fulfill this
obligation.  I deny that the Rules have agency, and therefore
deny this: the Rules lack the ability to fulfill their own
obligations.

A secondary point: It is generally regarded that if a Rule which
establishes an obligation is amended such that it no longer does so,
that obligation is discharged.  However, this is not the case in the
instant dispute.

I believe this has serious repercussions if it is determined that the
Mintor of VTs was destroyed.  The fate of the individual units is not
in the least clear.  It may be the case, for example, that each and
every Player possessing VTs is presently in continued violation of the
Rules for failing to destroy eir VTs, as required by Rule 1579.

I also believe that this means that even if VTs lost their Mintor
briefly, none of the units have actually been destroyed, since the
mandated procedure for destroying currencies has not been executed by
the persons required to do so.

That's ok, it appears that there are plenty of VTs in circulation,
although illegally, even if VTs lost their Mintor briefly.

The matter may belong before a Judge, but not as criminal matter.

If Harlequin is interested, he should CFJ on the question of whether
his message had the affect Morendil says it does.  (In theory, anyone
could, but I think it would be more proper for Harlequin, as the
party in interest, to make the CFJ).

Hm, that might be.  However, I do not think that would absolve P-Note
and Indulgence owners of their duty to destroy their own P-Notes and
Indulgences, as required by Rule 1579.  All it would do is prevent the
Currency from ceasing to exist.

In my opinion, nonsense. Rule 1579 says:

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.  All Players have Mint Authority.

Note that it does not use the phrasing "shall be destroyed", but "is
destroyed". In my opinion, while "shall be destroyed" would have been
ambiguous as to whether it is an obligation or an automatic event, "is
destroyed" has no such ambiguity: it always refers to an automatic event.

Greetings,
rjan.

I see.  That makes sense.  So it still comes down to how many amendments do we
actually consider to have taken place within the proposal.

This would be an interesting turn of events.  8)

In particular, if the VTs (and P-Notes) owned by Players still exist (in
contravention to the Rules), have they already lost their status as Currencies
because of this?  If so, then it seems that any transfers that have been issued
by statements of the sort "I hereby transfer, etc." should be considered to
have been effective, since there is no rule that prevents players from
transferring entities that they own which are not Currencies.  Is that a true
statement or are we going to stick to the "it's permissible but not possible"
line here?  If it *is* true that transfers were possible, then do such
transfers satisfy obligations that other rules specify are satisfied by the
transfer of such an entity without specifying that such an entity is a
Currency?  Specific example relevant to myself (and indirectly to Zefram) -
could an obligation to transfer a P-Note (or VT) to the Bank then be satisfied
by the transfer of an illegally owned P-Note (or VT)?

Boy, this is really FUN!  8)

This would not have prevented the destruction of all individual units 
of those Currencies, though.

Ow. Are you aware that this is an explicit violation of the TIA
Rule (1497) ?

IOW, "ceases to exist". Unless the above is just trying to be cute,
remember that the Misanthropists' Currencies issue established that
there is quite a difference between "required" and "required by
someone"; and I suppose the same difference obtains between
"destroyed" and "destroyed by someone".

Rule 1579 calls for all units of the given Currency to be destroyed, 
when that takes effect all units of that Currency are destroyed, or, 
equivalently, cease to exist; also refer to Game Custom in the form 
of now extinct Rules that called for the destruction of Win Tokens in 
the same manner.

That may be true of the situation when PC passed, but I still claim
the Rules currently give a very specific definition of what it means to be
destroyed, so the above will not apply in the future.

You can stomp your feet all day long claiming that the Rules do not have
agency; that does not make it so. Game custom is on my side. BWAHAHAHA!

Now after you were so nice as to introduce that word, I can give an
alternative interpretation: the existence of a VT is a (postponing to
find out what the word was) epiphenomenal consequence of the Rules, and so
it is destroyed when the Rules say so.

If you want the game state only to change when Players report it, you have
some serious amending to do.

Greetings,
rjan.

Nonononono and a thousand times no - this has nothing to do with the
Rules that now state that the Mintor destroys Currencies. That is a
restriction on _Players_, not a restriction on _Rules_ !

Rule 1467/2's :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

had a strict equivalent way back when (and anyway is redundant with
1011). The point is, if you have a Rule that calls for units of a
Currency to be destroyed, applying that Rule means that we are
required to consider that these units no longer exist. There is no 
construction of 1467 and/or 1722 that could possibly result in the 
contention that the Rules in general may not call for Currencies to 
be destroyed.

Rule 1722 states

      A Currency is destroyed when Mintor of that Currency posts in
      the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

but that form has always (in the two years that I've been a Player)
been taken to mean "In addition to other procedures in the Rules, a
Currency is destroyed when..." rather than "a Currency is destroyed
when X, and only in this situation shall a Currency's destruction be
legal". Please read through the Ruleset and you will find tons of
examples.

I assume you refer to the CFJ 827 annotation on R1497: Attempting an illegal
move can, if the player reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a
violation of this Rule.

Rule 1442 says:

     A Voting Entity's Votes on a given proposal are counted for that
     Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicity submitted
     by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
     of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

It seems to me that knowingly casting a Vote while not having VTs doesn't
knowingly break any rules, as the Vote simply doesn't get counted.

While looking around at this stuff, it looks like we need a Voting Reform
badly.  There are many references to casting VTs and casting Votes and it all
just seems so sloppy.

It would seem so - I'm half-convinced, the other half will have to 
wait until I have slept a few hours and can actually read complex
documents again. ;)

No, I think his point is that the original poster (why do those 
attribution lines get cut off? it's rude to quote someone without 
acknowledging it) sent this message (through the Public Forum) to an 
officer required to carry out a task based on that message, knowing that 
he was not really voting. I don't necessarily agree; actually I haven't 
made up my mind yet.

Rule 880 reads:

An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e holds, provided
e specifies another Player to succeed em ... An Officer who resigns without
appointing a successor is deemed to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

-----

I'm confused.

An officer sends a message to the PF which only states "I hereby resign from
the Office of blah."  E is permitted to resign provided e specifies another
Player, which he didn't, therefore, e is not permitted to resign.  How can
the rule then say that an Officer who resigns without appointing a successor
is deemed to have appointed the Speaker?  That makes no sense!  E can't resign
without appointing a successor!
