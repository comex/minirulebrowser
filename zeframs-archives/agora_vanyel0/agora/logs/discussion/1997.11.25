Fine, then you post the next version, I don't mind.  All I remembered
was that *someone* suggested it but it never got adopted.

I was also going to add a Without Objection clause.

I thought you stated an intention to replace the self-repeal clause with
something like "This Rule shall be repealed when a Player states, Without
Objection, that e is repealing it"?

I'm glad you like the idea. In case I was misconstrued, I am not offended
that you re-protoed it; but I would like to reserve the right to propose
it myself. I'll probably do so soon.

I have already protoed a version with that modification, but I'll reword 
it to fix Chuck's objection before I proto it.

There also needs to be some consideration as to what to do when the Office
is Delegated. As it stands, it will no longer be held Indefinitely (or in
perpetuity, as it was in my proto). Should the Office return to being held
in perpetuity after the period of delegation is over? I think that it may
not be worth the extra complexity. If perpetuity is lost in this fashion,
then the Speaker can always reinstate it later.

It wasn't really a veto power.  Instead, the Speaker could (in today's
terminology) make the AI of a Proposal that impacted on them 2 instead
of 1. 

Michael.
(Trying desperately to remember whether or not I ever used this power;
 I think I might have indicated that I wasn't happy with something
 that then failed the AI = 1 test, so I wasn't actually required to
 declare that I refused to consent to it.)

But if the Office has been dumped on the Speaker, then presumably the
original holder of the Office hasn't looked for a successor, in which
case, only one person has to: the Speaker.

The term 'Voter' is still used in two Rules (apart from Rule 103 itself):

Rule 112: If there is no other win condition defined, the Speaker randomly
 selects the Winner from among the Voters that are not under a Win-preventing
 condition.
Rule 1043: A Voter may always deregister (the Speaker may still deregister
 in most cases because of Rule 113, btw)

I want it at the option of the CotC; I don't want the CotC to have to
simply wait longer (for two players to object) before reassigning a CFJ. If
someone is late they should know that they might be penalized and replaced
immediately.

I think that gives the CotC more power than e deserves, to be quite
honest.

This, of course, lets the Promotor decide which one of several

there is no way to ensure that the Promotor in fact makes eir choice

The Promotor has no obligation whatsoever to maintain secrecy about a

Oops, I think that was supposed to be the assessor.

Emergency and the Guillotine may cause the Voting Period to end earlier.

Re: elJefe's Dissent

elJefe's recent dissenting opinion on CFJ 1062 brings up an interesting point
which I think needs clarification (at least for me).  While most of those who
thought that 1062 should have been judges false seemed to me to focus on the
idea that Zefram's TO was invalid, elJefe seems to focus more on the statement
of the CFJ itself.  I'm basing this on eir reference to the difference between
Plato and Plato's estate.

I would say, in general, that the two statements "Plato possesses at least .9
VT's" and "Plato is deemed to possess at least .9 VT's" are not logically
equivalent. However, it is my understanding that all legal fictions existing in
Agora at the time of a CFJ should be treated as true matters of fact for the
purposes of rendering a decision on that CFJ.  IOW, as far as a judge in Agora
is concerned, the two statements *are* equivalent.  This may be a
misapprehension on my part.

I hope elJefe (and others with an opinion on this) won't mind answering a
couple of questions on this to help clarify the issue for me.

1.  Given Zefram's TO, how would you have judged the second of the above two
statments, "Plato is deemed to possess at least .9 VTs"?

2.  Given current Reports and the fact that I have never received a package of
poker chips or any other objects purported to be Voting Tokens from an
Assessor, how would you have judged the statement, "David Albertz possesses at
least .9 VTs"?

We thank you for your contributions to our education and enlightenment.

You've forgotten the details of your example. Player A *has* looked
for, and found, a successor, Player B. It's just that B hasn't
consented at the time A deregisters. Under my proto, B gets the
Office if e then consents.

I agree. If you get your Judgement in late, but before the CotC reassigns,
you're 'lucky' - you get fined, but at least the judgement is accepted.

Well, you're the mathematician, Oerjan, not me. On the other hand,
you're evidently quite, quite Mad. Still, I would have thought that
99 mod 11 == 0, not 11. More generally, I thought that the purpose of
the modulo n operation was to deliver a number between 0 and n-1.
So m mod n can never be n.

Enlighten me.

Well, now, that's a bit hasty, as the Ents say. I can think of
three reasons straight off that this Rule Change is not prohibited
by R1698.

Firstly, even if the effect of the change was to reduce the number
of legal Voting Entities to zero, there's a good chance that the
sentence will be deleted within 4 weeks. I think we have a history
of interpreting possibility quite liberally, so I suspect that this
would be enough to get around R1698.

Secondly, it's not at all clear that the effect of the Rule Change is
to reduce the number of legal Voting Entities to zero.  It looks to
me as though R1671 is now in conflict with R206 on the question of
whether (certain) Players are permitted to vote.  R1671 claims that
only legally designated Frankenstein Monsters can vote, whereas R206
claims that legally designated Voting Entities can vote. This
conflict R206 wins.

Thirdly, note that R1671 designates the Contestmaster of each Contest
to be a Frankenstein Monster. So even if for some reason R206 does
not secure the right of Players to vote, Contestmasters can vote, I
think. There may already be enough Contestmasters to make Quorum, and
if not, we can always make more Contests.

AH, but 99 == 11 (mod 11) is NOT the same as (99 mod 11) == 11 (WHICH as
you say is FALSE.)

It is the same as (99 mod 11) == (11 mod 11), which is TRUE.

The (mod 11) QUALIFIES the equality to be in a QUOTIENT RING.

The (a mod b) notation is RARELY used as such in THE mathematics I am
acquainted with.

UNIVERSAL ALGEBRA RULES,
Oerjan.

Feeble attempt at translation:

Of course, it doesn't make sense to make the penalty for a late judgement
larger than the penalty for failing to judge, for obvious reasons.

Question: how long has the text:

      to cast Votes.

been a part of R1671? Has it just been added by our Very Mad
Scientist, or has it been around longer? If the latter, the Assessor
may need to correct some results.

I'm not opposed to adding an appropriate clause to this rule, but doesn't
R790 already cover this?

Rule 790/6 (Power=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

      ...

Just because an office is held indefinitely, does mean that the condition
given is falsified.

Not very well at all.  The only word you got right was "Latin",
although "whomever" is close.

That's pretty good.  The canon translation I have is "Whatever is said

The point is moot, but I thought the Order of the Evil Eye had voted
on a Proposal recently.

Agora is Byzantine and legalistic, but that seems to be the way we
like it. We regularly conduct incredibly long and abstruse
discussions on legal minutiae and matters of metaphysics. In a spirit
of fun and inquiry, naturally.

I'm curious: which Rules, or concepts, would you recommend we get
rid of for the sake of simplicity?

Next question: what if the Judge is both CotC *and* Justiciar?
This is rather unlikely, as if that is the case the Justiciar
has been retired from Office, but e could still be holding
it temporarily.

I would say leave the proto as it is; although this would
allow the Judge to unilaterally grant emself an extension,
I think the case will be rare enough that we don't have
to legislate for it.  (Plus, another chance
to bring Abuse of Responsibility into play. :)

I think both Crito and Morendil have addressed this point (Crito may have
done so during the discussion after his original Judgement). It is no
doubt true as Morendil noted that an ordinary RL Court faced with this 
question would rule that Plato cannot own anything. But that view is
the result of applying RL standards about what is sensible that are not
necessarily applicable in the context of a game.

As I made clear in my own Judgement, I do not like the principle
invoked by Crito in his Judgement that 'arbitrary legal fictions', as
Morendil calls them, can be created to be the possessors of VTs.
Nevertheless, once you have adopted the numbers on paper (or numbers
in files) view of Currency holdings, there seems to be no reason to
think that we cannot have a file with 'Plato: 0.9 VTs' written in
it, which counts for legal purposes as the possession by Plato of
0.9 VTs. Such a view seems to me to be possible, if not particularly
attractive - to me. But I still think it's a matter of taste.

Speaking of interest in the subject, I have a question about
Lost in Space.  How is it that Jonathan Harris (Dr. Smith)
appeared in every episode, yet still managed to get billing
on the opening credits as "special guest star?"

[Disclaimer: I don't know for a fact that he was in every episode.
He has been in every episode I've seen, however, which is a fair
number.]

I'm not entirely sure I'm going to propose this proto, or even keep
developing it. It seems to have served its purpose of igniting 
discussion on the issue, with the result that Jeff and Scott have
both now suggested ideas which are less bureaucratic than mine, 
because they don't employ Applications.

I would support a proto in which:

1. The CotC must accept late Judgements. Ie the CotC is not given
   a choice about whether to accept a late Judgement depending on
   whether e likes it.
2. Late Judgements are penalized, although not as heavily a Failure
   to Judge. I could support increasing the penalty for FtJ.
3. The CotC has the right to reassign at any time after the one week
   deadline for submission of Judgement expires.

This would give the CotC some political clout.

Ah, so the case of Heather Locklear (who was similarly "special guest
star" on Melrose Place) has a precedent. My guess is that Harris
shrewdly had a clause inserted into his contract specifying that he
be billed as such. That's certainly what Locklear did.

(And no, I don't watch Melrose Place.)

I tend to agree.  There is already a prohibition on the situation in
question being persistent.  If we're in the case where the CotC is
also the Justiciar, we will have bigger problems than the ability of
the Clerk of the Courts to unilaterally finagle an extension on time
to Judge.

That's intentional, a) Checking P-note holdings would be a hassle for the
Assessor, who doesn't keep those records, and b) If there's a indeterminate
amount of P-notes in a Player's possession (all too possible) that wont affect
the Assessor's determination of Quorum, and the outcome of the affected
vote.
