Protoproposal Chaos236 [rev. 3]

Motions, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rules 789, 1500, 1564, 1826, 1827, 1828 and 1868
be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) The Court of Appeals shall have exclusive jurisdiction to
          decide any question regarding:
        (1) the correctness or legality of the Judgement entered by a
            Judge in a Call for Judgement;
        (2) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of any
            Judicial Order;
        (3) the correctness, appropriateness, or legality of the grant
            or denial of any Judicial Motion; or
        (4) any allegation that a Judge has failed to properly perform
            eir duties as a Judge.

      (b) A question shall be certified to the Court of Appeals by the
          Clerk of the Courts when any of the following hold:
        (1) any three Players have requested, in the Public Forum,
            that the question be certified;
        (2) the question involves the issuance of an Order binding
            some Player and that Player has requested, in the Public
            Forum, it be certified; or
        (3) the question involves the correctness of a Judgement
            convicting a Player of a Crime and that Player has
            requested, in the Public Forum, it be certified.

      (c) When a question is certified to the Court of Appeals, the
          Court shall immediately convene and collectively decide the
          question, either in the affirmative or the negative, and
          upon reaching a decision the Court shall inform the Clerk of
          the Courts of its decision and the reasons therefore.

      (d) The Court of Appeals shall also have the power to execute
          such Appellate Orders as may be necessary to enforce its
          determination, subject to the limitations established in the
          Rules upon Appellate Orders.

      (e) The Clerk of the Courts is directed to establish a system of
          nomenclature for certified questions so as to permit easy
          and unambiguous reference to them.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to a Court. 
          This may be either a Common Court or the Court of Appeals.

      (b) A Motion is filed by submitting it to the Clerk of the
          Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ or certified question to
          which the Motion applies, and setting forth the action
          requested.

      (c) The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed
          Motion to the Court in question as soon as possible after
          receiving it.

      (d) Within five days (unless the Court defers ruling on the
          motion) the Court shall rule on the Motion, either granting
          or denying it.  If a Court fails to rule or defer ruling on
          a Motion within the time alloted by this subdivision, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (e) A Court may defer ruling on a Motion by informing the Clerk
          of the Courts that it is doing so, in which case it must
          either grant or deny the Motion not later than it issues a
          decision on the CFJ or certified question with which the
          Motion is associated.  A Court may not defer ruling on a
|         Motion made after a decision has been issued.  If the Court
          fails to rule on a deferred Motion by the time it issues a
          decision on the related CFJ or certified question, it is
          assumed to have denied it.

      (f) The effect of granting a Motion depends on the nature of the
          Motion granted, but generally amounts to requiring the Court
          to perform as requested by the Motion.  A Motion requesting
          a Judicial Order, if granted, requires that Court to execute
          the Order requested.

      (g) A Court rules on a motion by filing its ruling of grant or
          denial with the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons
          it chooses to state.

      (h) Upon receipt of a Court's ruling on a Motion, the Clerk
          shall note the ruling made and the reasons, if any, on the
          record of the CFJ or certified question, and shall notify
          the Player who made the Motion of the ruling.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) Whenever a Call for Judgement is received by the Clerk of
          the Courts, the Clerk shall convene a new Common Court to
          hear that CFJ, and shall assign a Player to act as the Judge
          of that Court.

      (b) If the Player assigned as the Judge of a Court ceases to be
          eligible to act as the Judge in that Court, and any CFJ
          assigned to that Court is not fully resolved, the Clerk of
          the Courts shall assign a new Player to act as the Judge of
          that Court.

      (c) Once a CFJ is assigned to a Common Court, it shall remain
          assigned to that Court, unless transferred to another Court
          by an Order of Transfer.

      (d) The selection of Players to act as the Judge of a Common
          Court shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
          to serve as the Judge of that Court.

      (e) Once assigned as the Judge of a Court, that Player remains
          the Judge of that Court until e is recused as Judge of that
          Court, or e ceases to be a Player.

      (f) A CFJ is fully resolved if:
        (1) it has been either judged or dismissed and such judgement
            or dismissal has not been vacated; and
        (2) every filed Motion which applies to that CFJ has been
            either granted or denied.

Steve asks:

>>2.  I hereby order the PO labeled VT671, in the Accountor's report of
>>15 March 1999, to be vacated.  (Note: it has already been satisfied.)

>>3.  I hereby order the Clerk of the Courts to pay out .84 VTs to Blob.

>What's the rationale for that last Order? Has the payment of Blob's
>Commission been on those Proposals been held up awaiting resolution of
>this matter?

No, if the payment had been held up then all I would need to do is amend
that order as well.  But since it has been paid, the original PO needs to be
vacated and Blob will have to pay back the entire .9 VTs.  Then e
will have received no commission for that batch.  The .84 VT pay out
reimburses Blob for the amount of commission that e *should* have
received.  There is no provision in the Rules to correctly handle
an amendment to a satisfied PO the way there is for handling a
vacation of a satisfied PO.
