I don't see why. If the game should develop factions competing with
other for control of the political agenda using scarce resources, so
much the better, I say.

The Office still exists. There was a Proposal recently to repeal it,
but it failed Quorum. I've just proposed another Proposal which will
repeal it if it is adopted, but that Proposal hasn't been distributed
yet.

High traffic?  You must not be on any interesting mailing lists. :)

I am on at least three lists that get more mail a day than the Agora
lists generate in a week.  These lists are not "high traffic".

I don't see any reason not to use findmail, if they're interested.

I just got my magic eight ball to work!  I want to thank blob for the
model in the VT, and Macross, Morendil, harlequin, and all the others
who helped, but especially Macross who helped me push the code into the
object and was there when it worked.

I am taking orders now for dice and simple fortune predictors.  I also
do custom objects, no job to small.

for technical and learning curve reasons. Then just let it grow.

>What should the style be...
>Hack & Slash? [ala Dungeons and Dragons]
>Economic? [trade, etc.]
>Combinations, other?

I personally find the idea of RPG MUDs intriguing, and I have also
started a charcater in one some time ago, but gave it up again becasue
I simply don't have the time. It is fun to have a character who learns
by training, gets hungry and has to get money and food. But I don't
have the time to let my char do all that.

I would take some time to learn the MOO language and program a few
simple objects, because that is a creative process and I can learn
something useful as I move along.

But actually, of course, this uestion is not only an annoying problem
on the way to connecting Agora with a MUD, and creating some
interesting politics. This question leads to interesting politics
itself: There are differing interests and ressources (time,
programming experince, MUD experience) and therefore different
positions we Agorans have on this, and we'll have to find a way to
reconcile them.

We can try to force everyone into the same result, or just let
everyone do whatever they like. We can split our efforts between the
SW and the AgoraMOO project (potentially leaving too little ressources
for either of these to succeed), or we can try to unite our efforts.

Personal interests quickly become involved - players who start out in
one or the other and grow attached to their players and/or creations
there.

>Who should determine the physics? How can it be changed?

Not Agora - that's the challenge. To start interacting with a system
where we don't have godlike powers. BTW, AgoraMOO also qualifies for
this, because of the power and irreplacability of Morendil.

>What elements of Agora should be influenced by the MUD...

Formnally (i.e. in the forms of rules): None.

Informally: Whatever we like. We may, e.g., pay for things we want to
obtain from a player in the MUD by Agora VTs (transferred in the Agora
infrastructure).

My MOO builders' Contest idea is also an attempt to loosely couple the
two systems.

>Who should have to play in the MUD...

I'm for

>Only those who want to?

Of course, we may create by force characters for every Agoran. We
might even introduce legislation that penalizes Agorans who never use
their character. But I doubt it would find a majority.

>Should the MUD attract non-Agorans? If so, how?

Why not? Maybe make it attractive for other nomickers?

The current Agoran ruleset does a pretty good job of controlling our
behaviour.  If we set up AgoraMOO, then the ruleset would control the
behaviour of the person implementing it to greater or lesser extent
and this would be control of the physics by the rules.

No, no, and no again.  It is the whole point of what Scott, Steve,
Blob and I are proposing that the rules *not* attempt to control the
people who control the MUD (i.e., the wizards).  Rather, the rules
should attempt to control the behaviour of the Players *only*.
Enforcement of those rules will definitely be an interesting
challenge, but these rules will only constrain Player behaviour; not
how objects should work in the world.

I don't think we want to regulate any physics at all.  To my mind the
interest in this exercise is forcing our game to come to grips with a
physics that is more than disembodied agents (the Players) and a set
of documents.

I don't know about this.  I think it would be quite interesting, for
example, to be able to make our area in SW a haven for Sanom outlaws.
But think of the tension that might cause.  Alternatively, we could go
for the other extreme, and try to make it some sort of nasty, dystopic
place that insisted on only characters of a certain (SW) race.

This is true.  If you manage to attract a reasonable set of people to
play the MOO who are not players in Agora, then you may even be in a
position to implement something like my Polis proposal.

Well, I think it's best to assume the Judgement is correct until the

Well, on the IN list hardly anything is happening at all.

Acka seems to be alive and kicking, and their webpage is well
maintained and up-to-date. They've even got a domain now,
www.ackanomic.org. Whether they'd be interested in our MUD-related
projects, I don't know.

NRn is moving slowly, as usual, and is documented on its webpages

I don't know much about the other nomics, I must admit.

I agree with Blob that this is definitely one of the interesting
issues.  Shattered World is not inhabited by well-behaved Agorans on
the whole.  If people can cheat they will.  The general culture with
respect to the law seems to be one of ignoring it as much as possible,
with it being up to the establishment to enforce it.

I think it will definitely be a challenge to make laws that we can
enforce, are still reasonably interesting, and which also protect our
communal investment in the Agoran zone of the MUD.  

One enforcement option that Blob didn't mention in his post (ref:
<980808022854.21222@cse.unsw.edu.au>) is that of NPC Guards.  From
reading the documentation, it sounds as if these 'monsters' are bought
by the Sanom City establishment.  As I understand it, their role is
entirely to attack people that are on the list of outlaws.  They
clearly have pretty simple programming behind them, and presumably
don't represent a major effort by the Wizards.  The price for Guards
varies with their combat strength, so that the establishment can vary
the amount they spend on "Law 'n' order" and have this make a
difference. 

It'd be interesting to see if a more configurable brand of robot could
be hired by our own establishment.  (The Wizards might well charge
more for this sort of thing.)  Perhaps particularly charitable people
would be like to be 'hired' by the state to act as guards too..

Of course, both this option and that of bounties (which we should also
embrace), is dependent on the state actually having some cash.  This
is also worth spending some thought on.  (This is all starting to
sound like SimCity! :-)

Introducing the notion of compulsory voting based on net worth is

Relatively early on in the discussion last week, a few people
expressed the opinion that we could choose to reify (make "real") our
Currencies in our destination MUD, or keep them virtual and that the
possibilities were an all-or-nothing affair.  I don't think this is
true.

In particular, I think we can allow for interaction between our
economy in VTs and the economy in the MUD without feeling that we had
lost the ease of an e-mail economy.  My feeling that this is possible
is based on the real world, where money comes in forms that are
concrete (coinage and notes) and virtual (cheques and bank balances).

I don't see why we couldn't mint coins of our own in the MUD context
and allow these to be fully equivalent with our own VTs.  People
playing in the MUD could use our coins just as they might use any
other coinage.  \footnote{Setting this up would perhaps require a
little helping work from the Wizards, but I don't think this is a
compromise with our principles of working outside the game physics; it
would rather be a precondition on us joining the game that certain
elements of the physics be modified to suit.  Drawing up this wishlist
will clearly be an important part of the move itself.}  The
Accountor's responsibility would be to track VTs that happened to
reside in the virtual world; those that were in circulation would
naturally be beyond their knowledge.  It would be up to the Chancellor
to ensure that the Bank's MUD-world embodiment had the coinage to
honour VT obligations from the virtual bank.

With our own coinage, we then get into all sorts of interesting
questions about inter-convertability with the existing currencies.  (I
don't know for sure what the situation is there, but I assume there is
one gold standard that operates throughout the whole MUD.)
Unfortunately, we will start off at quite a disadvantage if the
existing currency is an element of the game physics.  We probably
won't want to tie our currency to gold, because this will probably
expose us to currency obligations that we won't be able to meet.  On
the other hand, we will need to pay some bills in gold I suspect.

This brings me onto the economy at SW in general.  If their
documentation is to be believed (check:
http://gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au/economy.htm and
http://www.cs.monash.edu.au/~mmcg/shat/economy.html), their economy is
zero-sum.  This is pretty unrealistic for all that it is a big
improvement on what happens in most MUDs.  The amount of value in a
world should, in general, increase over time as people spend time and
effort in improving their environment, creating things and the like.
If the money supply doesn't expand to keep up, then you will get
deflation.  The second reference above explains what happens in more
detail, and I don't think I quite understand what is going on, but it
seems likely to me that SW doesn't actually allow for an increase in
value through the world, thus making it hard for people to think that
they are improving their lot.

Has anyone got a better model we might be able to persuade the Wizards
to adopt?  

Michael.

As far as I can see, the same problem applies to Shattered residents ,
and they seem to be dealing with it fine.

I'm not saying anything else. My point is that the hierarchy of
power in AgoraMOO is occupied by persons already loyal to Agora,
thus our enforcement is bound to be more effective. This doesn't
imply any attempt at controlling the wizard's actions. It will simply
be the case that the players charged with enforcement (city guards,
whatever) can be recruited from the ranks of Agora.

Hmm, I just realised that the rules of Acka probably require me to say
something here since I'm Ambassador there. We are indeed alive and kicking.
About the most interesting thing that has happened recently was the repeal
of anti-voting due to four votes from non-player-entities, one person
voting yes when they intended to vote no and one person antivoting (!) This
hass now lead to a discussion about the entire nature of the game being
discusse and a proposal is currently under consideration that would repeal
points totally. Now would probably be as good a time as ever to see if
they'd be interested.

What I could see happening was a new world being set up under internomic
control. Unless I've missed the point entirelythen that could allow you to
shape the new world as you want it but not be able to legislate for it's
environment. I would hope that Acka and several of the other nomics would
join such a venture and it could also help to encourage trade between nomics.

I shall ask the rest of Acka what they think about the basic idea if you wish.

Tom.

Having the world under the control of InterNomic is no better than
having it under the control of Agora, in my opinion.  The UN can't
change the Earth's gravitational constant, any more than the United
States can.

After seeing the other suggestions recently posted, I agree and retract my last

The style will develop according to the tastes of the MUDers, but our tendency
is to explore ecomonic and political styles.  Of course, you may need to look
at "marketing issues" if you want to attract a lot of outside participants.

Physics should be determined external to the Rules.  But if we build our own,
we may want everyone to be able to have input.  Ultimately, of course, it is
the code maintainers who really determine the physics.

>What elements of Agora should be influenced by the MUD...

Define "influence".  8)  It should be possible to play Agora fully, without
having to step in the MUD.

>Who should have to play in the MUD...

Definitely "Only those who want to".

>Should the MUD attract non-Agorans? If so, how?

Sure.  I like the idea of attracting other Nomics.  Maybe Internomic could be
moved there.  As to attracting other "players", I haven't had a good enough
access to the Web for a long time to see what kinds of MUDs are attracting what
kinds of players, but obviously, if you want to bring in the crowds you have to
give them what they want.

>What other concerns are there? Suggestions? Comments?

I can see a definite split forming in the opinions on whether to start our own
or join another.  It would be nice if there are enough Players in both camps
with enough time to explore both possibilities.  Right now my time is too
limited and my access to the internet too erratic to allow me to participate,
much to my regret.  Maybe later in September things will change.  The
programmer in me would like to participate in the coding of AgoraMOO, but I
think it would also be interesting to see how a colony in Shattered World works
out.

Do try to log in to both environments at least once to check them
out, though... Shattered is at gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au:2666 and AMOO
at netdive.com:7777.

I am not particularly interested in Shattered World, really... I am past
my hack-and-slash MUD period, and even when I was in the middle of it, the
one mud I tried which had mandatory eating and drinking was kind of a
traumatic experience ... I never really managed to get off the ground
before dying of starvation, and once that happened, I didn't manage to
recover.

The problem might be that I liked to take the time to walk around and
explore the MUD, rather than running frantically around in order to
survive.

Greetings,
rjan.

Yuck, I hope Agora Moo never requires this.  The metaphor is
disgusting.  Why not make mushrooms or fruit grow and players could
gather those  to eat if they are hungry?  It would be necessary to go
exploring to find them, because in high traffic areas, they would be
quickly gathered. I think this is less tedious than killing rats. It
would also encourage exploration, and expansion, gardens.  I think I
might be able to program a fruit tree.


I still hope that such requirements are minimal, and tied to some sort
of exertion. I don't see the point to requiring ppl to eat just to
stand around and talk, and i think that we want to encourage people to
hang out there.

Except that you get hungry while doing that; and if you don't want it
to take too much time, you need to buy weapons - an axe costs a
minimum of 80 gold coins, and since weapons get damaged with use, you
have to keep killing critters to buy weapons to kill critters to buy
weapons... I've logged a good few hours in SW now, on the principle
that I wanted to know exactly what we're getting into, and in my 
opinion we'd have a tough time getting to the point where we could
start doing meaningful things.

Heh, this reminds me of when I tried to program dandelions into Vikingmud.
Somehow the check I had not to grow more than one dandelion in each room
didn't work, and it almost crashed the game.

Given that, it was probably fortunate that the procedure to make players
spread the seeds didn't work either.

Greetings,
rjan, who recently discovered he had forgot his Vikingmud password,

And if it takes a while to before you can  do meaningful things, I'd
rather be taking the time building up a new world.  Programming hones a
real skill, and is much more enjoyable than killing virtual rats.

Good for the dandelions, i never have seen just one dandelion. I have a
quota, so I think that would prevent the worst results, but you never
know.

Yet, there have been times in the past when we've done the exact opposite

I agree it would be tough at first. That's why I think we should work
together as a community to support each other, at least initially. If we
can start some money-making business ventures in Merenth, we'll be able
to afford to eat without killing rats.

I think that here you're appealing to a principle very similar to one
which was actually enshrined in Agora's Initial Rule 213 (the ancestor
of our Rule 991), to the effect that "[d]isagreement...may be created by
the insistence of any player." Of course, that principle no longer
appears in the Rule. But even if it did, I'm not sure you could make the
use of it you do here. R217 distinguishes cases in which the Rules are
clear from cases in which they are not, and requires the Judge to
consider game custom, amongst other things, only in the latter cases. If
we say that the fact that a Judgement concerning the interpretation of
a Rule has been Appealed indicates that the Rule is necessarily unclear,
we collapse the distinction which R217 invites Judges to make. 

In other words, I still think that lee was entitled to judge that the
text of R1808 had a clear meaning contrary to game custom, the calls for
Appeal notwithstanding. If your argument were accepted, no Judgement
that the clear meaning of the text of a Rule is contrary to game custom
could ever survive Appeal, for on your view, the mere fact of Appeal
establishes unclarity, and hence the primacy of game custom. I think
this is bad interpretative practice. In addition, I think we have
independent reasons to doubt that the Appeal of a Judgement is evidence
that a Rule is unclear, for the motivations of the Appellants may have
nothing whatsoever to do with the clarity of the Rule in question.

I disagree that "directly to X" differs *strongly* in meaning to "to X
only". I think they differ only weakly in meaning. In particular, "to X
only" *implies* "directly to X", since sending something indirectly to X
only would involve sending it to someone else, violating the requirement
that the message be sent to X only. Hence in the only other case in
which the Rules require the submission of a message to a specific
Player, and prohibit that message from being sent to the PF, we find
that the Rules *implicitly* require that the message be sent "directly
to X". So the example of Secret Voting actually serves to reinforce the
substantial correctness of lee's Judgement.

Not the mere fact of Appeal, but the fact that the controversy 
centers on the meaning of the Rule. But I'll grant your point.

Not true. When I send mail to you, it passes through several relays
before reaching you. If I wanted to add one more relay, that would
make the submission of email from me to you less direct, but not
necessarily less exclusive. Conversely, it is conceivable that a more
direct way of reaching you might be less exclusive; for instance, if
I left a message on your answering machine, and your roommate got it
first, that message would be invalid as a Voting message. 

I'm assuming this is 'more direct' in some sense. The term 'direct'
in the context of Internet email is certainly a shifty one, and one
more reason to argue that its addition to a Rule should not be
allowed to change the substantial meaning of that Rule. 

In any case, I stand by my contention that "directly to X" and "only
to X" are essentially orthogonal.
