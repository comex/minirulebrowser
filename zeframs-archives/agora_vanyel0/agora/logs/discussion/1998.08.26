Yes, this makes sense to me.  But then we are back to the distinction you make
between primary "claims" and secondary "claims".  I still wonder how you
justify treating certain claims as secondary.

Firstly, I think it's a very natural view to have. Rules makes claims.
Sometimes these claims conflict. The Rules also make claims about how to
resolve those conflicts. It's very natural to call these claims 'second
order'. Alright, you say, but what justifies treating these claims you
call 'second order' differently to those which you call 'first order'?

I think it's a non-obvious consequence of the two Assumptions I outlined
in my CFJ. You'll recall that the first of these was the Mirror Image
Assumption that precedence and deference are logical mirror images of
each other, so that "A takes precedence of over B" is logically
equivalent to "B defers to A". I think the Mirror Image Assumption is
strongly supported by R1030, where precedence and deference claims are
treated in just this way.

The second Assumption was the Conflict Assumption, which says that we
don't treat precedence claims as conflict-avoiding, but rather as
conflict-resolving. In framing the CFJ, my main concern was to establish
that we should therefore treat deference claims in the same way. But
here we're trying to answer a different question. What we have to notice
now is that if we treat precedence claims as first order claims on a par
with the other claims made by Rules, we shall have to treat precedence
claims as conflict-avoiding, which it would be extremely counter-intuitive 
to do.

Why do I say that treating precedence claims as first order means
treating them as conflict-avoiding? Well, look at how those who think
that all claims are first order treat *deference* claims. Consider two
Rules:

A1: Foo is equal to 6. This Rule defers to other Rules which give Foo a
    different value.

B1: Foo is equal to 5.

My reading of A1 is that it contains a first order provision about the
value of Foo (that it equals 6), and a second order provision about how
to resolve conflicts with other Rules when they arise. Michael, and
others who read deference clauses as first order provisions, say that A1
and B1 do not conflict. They say, in effect, that A1 does not claim that
Foo is equal to 6, but rather that it makes only the conditional claim
that Foo is equal to 6, unless another Rule says otherwise. Since in
this case another Rule does say otherwise, A1 does not actually claim
that Foo is equal to 6, and so there is no conflict.

Viewed in isolation, this is a plausible reading reading of the
situation. But combined with the Mirror Image Assumption, it has
unpalatable consequences. For, according to the Mirror Image Assumption,
the above pair are equivalent to the following pair:

A2: Foo is equal to 6.

B2: Foo is equal to 5. This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which
    give Foo a different value.

Since the two are logically equivalent, if there is no conflict in the
first case, there can be no conflict in the second case, and this, I
say, is counter-intuitive, not to mention at odds with game custom
concerning the interpretation of precedence claims. We can see, then,
that the only way to preserve the Mirror Image Assumption is to treat
both precedence and deference claims differently to first order claims,
to treat them, not as modifying first order claims, but as resolving
conflicts between them.

Of course, one could give up the Mirror Image Assumption. But how then
to explain the mirror image treatment given to precedence and deference
claims by R1030?

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

And how to explain the fact that R1482 would have worked in exactly the
same way if it had said:

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the lower Power defers to the Rule with the higher Power.

P3785 (Permanent Electioneering) has 3 votes FOR, none against.
I therefore call on supporters of the Proposal to declare Presence on it
(it's free, after all).

For P3786, I offer to pay 2 VTs to each of the first 2 Players to
vote FOR the Proposal.

Oh, and I meant to add: the VPs finish midnight, Saturday night, GMT.
