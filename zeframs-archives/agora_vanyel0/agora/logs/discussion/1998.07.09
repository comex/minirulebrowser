I think you're right. Does 'effective' imply 'undisputed'?

I think your version is more complicated to administer, since it
requires Recordkeepors to track in much more detail exactly when
Players are coming On and Off Hold. So I prefer Crito's.

Then apply the obligations to the position of Speaker, not to the particular
Player holding the position.

Hmmm....  Perhaps what I really meant to say is that we might temporarily
treat currencies held by Players on hold as if they didn't exist.  They
don't count as in circulation and when a tax is levied the Player in
question is not considered to be holding any of the currency.

I like your idea of simply giving the Player time to pay.  Couldn't this be
done by requiring all POs issued to a Player on Hold be stayed until they
come off hold?

Well, that's basically what I proposed to do, although I didn't use the
technical language of staying. But Crito's solution is probably
preferable.

Firstly, I will point out that you are objecting not to the proposal
itself, but to my recommendation how the Assessor might use this lever
in the current situation. It doesn't necessarily follow that having the
lever is a bad thing. The Chancellor could allieviation the current
problems by raising the BOS significantly, but e doesn't because there
is sufficient political pressure for em not to.

Perhaps this lever is redundant then, because the same effect could
be had by increasing the BOS and the tax threshold. To some degree this
is true, but I rather like the symmetry of having a this third lever.
I could create some interesting dynamics between the Chancellor,
Accountor and Assessor. Tying it to the Assessor's income makes things
even more interesting.

On matters of economic policy, I will say more in a follwoing email.

On the current economic situation, I am pleased to see that our economy
seems to have taken off at last. The degree of wheeling and dealing
going on excites me, and I'm not about to suggest that we go back to
the days when everything was free.

I do, however, think we have picked an inopportune time to be
experimenting with quite this level of scarcity, when a large proportion
of our population is relatively inactive. As a result, we seem to be
struggling to achieve quorum on every single proposal, which is 
getting rather tedious. 

The blame for this does not really lie on our current economic policy.
History will show that this sort of lull happens every year. But this
year we have the tools in place to rectify the situation. By setting
the parameters correctly, we can boost our economy through this
difficult time. Not to remove all economic pressures, but to save
the game from stagnation as proposal after proposal fails to gather
enough support to even make Quorum. 

The most excellent thing about the economic levers we have established
is that we can tune our economy from season to season, to suit the 
level of activity at that time. This being a naturally dry season,
I suggest we turn up the sprinklers. :)

Yes, but this has the disadvantage of allowing a Player to postpone PI
infractions indefinitely by remaining On Hold except for the infinitessimal
time it takes to make a move within a message.  Of course, e could only send
one such message every 96 hours.

Interestingly, I can no longer find a definition of 'disputed Order' in the
Rules, although I think the natural meaning would be an Order whose validity is
the subject of a pending CFJ.  In that case the CotC is required to stay the
order and I think 'effective' does imply that the order must be neither stayed
nor vacated.  Of course you don't automatically get this protection upon filing
a CFJ.  You have to wait until the CotC actually issues the stay order.

Yes, that's a nice, clean solution too.  I wonder if anyone (Scott) would
object to the condition that a PO is automatically stayed when issued to a
Player On Hold and automatically becomes effective as soon as the Player comes
Off Hold?

Why not have the announcement of going on and off hold Implicitly Order the
stay and implicitly vacate the stay?
