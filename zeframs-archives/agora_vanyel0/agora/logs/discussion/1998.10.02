If it really is that important that people should vote on Proposals,
then we shouldn't charge people for the privilege.  It seems to me
that the basic thrust of the Duty to Vote proposal is to return Agora
to the way it used to be, when voting was much more universal.  This
might be a reasonable objective in itself, but I think coercive
proposals are a bad way of going about this.

One of the reasons why people are reluctant to spend VTs on votes
because they are useful for other things.  In particular, I have been
consciously trying to amass VTs because I can then pay good prices for
Indulgences.  

Perhaps this is a better cause yet: I will transfer 2VTs to each
player who votes AGAINST "A Duty to Vote".  I will do this by seeing
how people have voted when the results come out. 

Michael.

But this time, that is the reason you want it lowered.    I don't find
my self sympathetic to that reason, although the others seem reasonable.

I think voting is too expensive.  If the BOS is raised, i will agree to
keep the VTCL the same for now.  That is a compromise to me because my
own inclinations were to raise it.

BUS: Moo Builders' contest

I didn't save the message, but didn't someone else submit one of their own
rooms recently to add to the competition?  I think it might have been macross
(or maybe Morendil), but I'm not sure.

Hi all,

Here is the first round of the Moo Builders' Contest. It's a bit of a
slow start, but at least it is a test run.

In the next two weeks you (all Agorans, not just members of the
contest) can vote (send votes to me) for your favourite candidate for
best room - of those submitted in September.

I admit that the choice for this contest is somewhat limited ;) - if
you think that's silly, why don't you send a submission for the
November MBC together with your vote? Thanks for your attention.

Here is the submission:

For best room: The Underground System (as a whole), by lee.

For best object: no submission.

In two weeks' time I'll announce the winner, who will then get a prize
of 1.5 VTs.

Kolja A.

I don't remember seeing such a mail - maybe it was on a-d while I
wasn't subsribed there? I'd be more than willing to include more
submissions in October's contest. So if anyone's submission was lost,
please let me know asap.

Yes and no. It is true that what I'm trying to achieve with 'A Duty to
Vote' is increased voter turnout. But this does not represent a return
to the way things used to be because the rest of the game has changed so
much since the days when voting was free. Let me emphasize once again
that I'm coming at this from a game designer's perspective. The question
I'm asking voters to ask themselves is: will 'A Duty to Vote' make the
game interesting? I think the answer is 'yes'.

The trouble is, nobody else seems to have any other ideas. To tell you
the truth, it's a bit depressing to encounter so much resistance to new
ideas when they're the only ideas anyone is putting forward. Is any of
this relentless negativism going to be balanced by a constructive
alternative? I'm proposing a 3 month trial of a different way of doing
things. I'm prepared to try something different and see what happens.
And if we don't like it, it will go away. What are you proposing?
