That's an interesting way to phrase it. It seems to me that the rules
_do_ impose such requirements, e.g. in the rule on paying for
voting. My idea is to consider the required action a null action,
while your phrase sounds as if you deny that the requirement is made
in the first place. This I find confusing, because the rules do say
"so and so is required to execute a PO for 0 VTs" - maybe not in these
very words, but still explicitly.

I don't believe in the Rules "requiring null actions". My point of
view is that the Rules either impose an actual obligation - a well-
defined action or set of actions has to be effected to fulfill it -
or they don't. I consider that a Rule saying "Every Week, Player
Morendil shall be required to post 0 or more messages to the PF"
doesn't impose any requirement on me, appearances to the contrary
notwithstanding.

This may be a matter of taste. Then again, it might not.

Protoproposal Chaos24 [rev. 2]

No Retroactivity

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created with a
Power of 3:

      No action by any Player may have, as a direct or indirect
      consequence, the effect of changing any part of the Game State
      prior to the moment at which that action occured.  Any change
      which the Rules might seek to require to occur at a time prior
      to the time of the Player action of which it is a consequence
      takes place instead at the time of that action.

Pay the officers at a per week rate but only cut the check once a month.
