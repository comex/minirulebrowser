The maximum number of votes you can cast is five. That is the most number
of votes you can cast on a Proposal regardless of any other Rule to
the contrary. You may cast two votes on any Proposal. That is not a
maximum, because if you were, say, Speaker, then you could cast a third
vote.

I am distinguishing here between a maximum and what one might call
a 'ceteris paribus limit'. I claim that R206 establishes a ceteris
paribus limit of two votes, and a maximum of five.

Consider the analogy of a device designed to warm a bottle of baby's
milk to a certain temperature. It does this by heating the water
surrounding the bottle to a certain temperature, say 60 degrees
celsius. What is the maximum temperature water in this device can
reach? The temptation to say '60 degrees' should be resisted, because
the thermostat in the device can malfunction, in which case the water
will keep heating up until it reaches its boiling point of 100 degrees
(assuming the device is at standard pressure). What the thermostat
does is to limit the temperature of the water. It doesn't change the
boiling point of water. What I suggest is that the phrase 'the maximum
temperature of water' is better understood in a context like this,
in which events do not always take their normal course and
malfunction of the device is a relevant possibility, to mean 'the
boiling point of water'.

Similarly, the phrase 'the maximum number of votes' in a context like
this in which events do not always take their normal courses and the
Player's being the Speaker as well an Officer affected by R1766 is a
relevant possibility, should be understood to refer to the five vote
limit set by R206.

Did you miss the P-Note I paid out to Blob in this morning's Wizard's
Report, or was that going to go into the next set of Bank Transactions?

I realize that I did mislabel it by calling it to the attention of
the Promotor rather than the Chancellor. My apologies.

Kolja, this is a wonderful contribution to Agoran literature for which
I both thank and congratulate you. It contains many stimulating comments,
on matters general and particular. I hope to reply to a number of remarks
you've made at greater length, but just at the moment I haven't the time.
For now, a simple 'Bravo!' will have to do.

What do you make of the difference in wording between 1766, which
states "This shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
permitted to be cast by that Player", and 1660, which has "This Rule
does not increase the maximum allowable votes that can be cast by a
Voting Entity" ?

Taking up the baby bottle analogy again, I take it you don't view
this difference as analogous to the one between "the highest water 
temperature this particular thermostat can be set to" and "the 
highest possible water temperature in general" ?

There's nothing inherently wrong with self-depriving Rules; we've 
enacted a lot of them in the past. "This Rule shall have no effect 
until date X", and the like.

You do seem to have a point here. The relevant provisions of both
Rule 1660 and 1766 are redundant; I note that 1465, the other Rule
to grant additional Voting privileges, does not include such a
provision.

Minor nit: I did vote in this (msg-ID:
<E0y8Obo-0000BG-00@merganser.cl.cam.ac.uk>).  But it makes no
difference so I'll not COE it.

On a second reading I noticed a few problems with some of the adopted
Proposals.

> Proposal 3703 (Steve)  AI = 1
> Speaker Transition Reform

>       (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
>       all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
>       of being Speaker;

I don't see how this paragraph can have much effect without a precedence
clause.

> Proposal 3705 (Crito)  AI = 2  (Silly when submitted)
> Cantus Cygneus

>       As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk of

Does this really require the Registrar to make that annotation?

How are Players supposed to get their first three
Plots?  It seems that we would all have to spend
15 VTs just to get started (as would any new
Players in the future).  Or am I missing
something?

Thanks anyway, but I realised the Sherlock was in a better time-zone

I am disappointed:  I surely expected you to also set a suitable Power for
the Rule fixing the Power loophole.

I must mention that it was my expectation as well.  In the scam I was
about to perpetrate, the Instrument loophole-closing rule (with
almost the exact wording that has been enacted) was intended to have
a Power of three.  As it is, with a Power of one, it doesn't close the
loophole, and would allow _my_ scam to pass through unchanged except for
a precedence claim.

I hope this is just an oversight.

It doesn't need one. R402 has higher precedence by virtue of lower
Number than any of the Rules which grant the Speaker special rights
and privileges.

I expect that Jeff is waiting to see what Title/Number the Rule is given,
so that he has an easy way of referring to it. The Rule was not given
a Title by the Proposal, a minor oversight.

No, I don't. Frankly, I don't think there's much to be made of this
minor difference in wording. In my view both Rules plainly refer
to the five vote maximum set by R206. Since this really is a maximum,
ie an absolute limit on the number of votes any Voting Entity can
cast, it makes no difference whether these Rules refer to the maximum
number of votes some individual Voting Entity can cast (as R1766
does), or whether they refer to the maximum number of votes that
Voting Entities in general can cast (as R1660 does). The same thing
is being picked out in each case.

But I'm not Speaker, so I can't. I am using the specific me, not the 
general "me" [as in "a Player"]. If I can cast two votes on, say, 
Proposal 3700, but not more than two votes, then why do you say I can 
cast a maximum of two votes? I think I've made my argument clear. I 
_think_ I understand yours, but I also think I don't, because I can't 
grasp how I could cast a maximum of five votes when, in fact, I can 
only cast two votes.

English, please? I don't know Latin.

I think I see. You consider the last sentence to apply to votes on 
_all proposals_, while I see it as only applying to _the proposal the 
extra votes are awarded on_. This would be analagous to what is the 
highest tempature the device can reach, _as it is now_, as opposed to 
as it might be in the future. The current ('actual') maximum versus 
the potential maximum.

The problem is, if you were to give me such a device and say 'the 
highest tempature the water inside this can reach is 100 degrees 
celsius', when I knew the thermostat regulates it at a maximum of 60 
degrees, I would believe you to be correct (if excessively literal); 
while if you gave me the device and said 'the highets tempature the 
water inside this can reach is 60 degrees celsius', I would also 
believe you to be correct. The difference is whether you are saying 
what might happen if the device is changed, versus what might happen 
as the device is now (assuming no unexpected events). Of course, if 
the air pressure were to change (for example, in outer space, or 300 
feet underwater), the 'maximum' tempature in your sense would _not_ 
be 100 degrees celsius; in fact, the 'maximum tempature' depends on 
how drastically the environment as it is (including the device) can 
be changed.

How does this apply to Rule 1766? I'm not sure. It appears that you 
are assuming that the maximum number of votes I could make is five, 
because I could (for example) become speaker. However, if we are 
allowing hypothetical situations to be included in our definition of 
'maximum', what if the five-vote limit is eliminated at some point in 
the future? Then, the 'maximum' number of votes I can make is higher 
than five - it's very large, possibly infinite. So I conclude that 
the maximum number of votes I can cast is aleph-null, since even if I 
can already cast five votes, I _might be able_ to cast two more, 
somehow. I submit that this is an absurd conclusion, and therefore 
some part of my argument is false. So... what part is it? [Note: I 
will not be excessively suprised if you can't find a flaw in one of 
the other parts... so let me make a few points: this is assuming you 
allow the future to be included; I am leaving out the possibility of 
human error; and I _am_ assuming this is not an Urgent proposal, so 
that an Urgent proposal could change the ruleset before votes are 
tallied]

I see a very distinct difference the maximum number of votes _you_ can
cast and the maximum _any_ Player can cast.

Rule 1766 refers to "the maximum number of votes that are permitted 
to be cast by that player.", which definitely refers to a specific 
player, and not players in general. It is also logical to assume that 
it means 'on that Proposal', as well, but since it is not stated, it 
could be argued to be 'on any given Proposal' or 'on Proposals in 
general'.
