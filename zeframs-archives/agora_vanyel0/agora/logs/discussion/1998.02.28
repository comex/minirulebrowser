So, Omnibus Reform is up for vote. Has the latest verison been adapted
to take into account the passage of 'Split the Assessor's functions'?

For goodness' sake Blob, he only said it was 'fallacious', which is really
nothing more than the truth. That's not rude or boorish.

I tend to think that since R1504 provides for the case already, 
the more appropriate Injunction for the situation is the one that
it requires the Judge to make.

Well, as I've already said, there are compelling reasons not to go
ahead with this at all. But I'm curious as to why you see the question
of the cost of votes as connected to the question of their indelibility,
as I call it. I see them as quite separate matters.

Actually, if we're going to make any change to indelibility, I think
we should go in the opposite direction and make voting on Proposals
indelible, as it is for Referenda and Elections. Indelibility provides
a friendlier environment in which to conduct negotiations, since (a)
once a Player has voted you don't have to worry about them any more,
and (b) voting then provides a nice public way of keeping one's
promises, and of announcing that there's no point trying to negotiate
withh you any further. It also prevents Players from saving VTs by
casting early votes, and then retracting them late in the Voting
Period, and finally, it's legislatively simpler, since you don't have
to worry about retraction or about changing votes. Taken together,
these points all add up to a strong case for indelibility across the
board. I'll work up a proto.

This was CFJ 1045, and you do remember wrong, partly.  Of the three
Justices, two ruled that the injunctions were illegal and inappropriate,
and one (Steve) ruled that they were inappropriate and did not feel the
need to comment on their legality.

CotC Andre:

Justiciar ElJefe:

The point is that Rule 663 requires (among other things) that an Injunction
be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules, and be issued in a manner
consistent with the Rules.  I fear that this injunction may fail this test
for the same reason as Morendil's.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1710 be amended to read,

      There shall exist the Office of Cartographor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 896 be amended by deleting the
paragraph reading "When a Player registers, eir Location is the
Welcoming Center."

      Speaker shall promptly inform the recipient that e has been
      Granted the degree by some means which has a reasonable
      likelihood of reaching the recipient.  The Speaker may Delegate
      this duty to any other willing Player.

So what you're saying is that the Vogons write poetry because underneath
their mean callous heartless exteriors they really just want to be
loved. Is that right ?

Protoproposal Chaos33 [rev. 1]

The Industrial Revolution

| Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

|     Certain entities, or classes of entities, may be designated as
|     Possessions by the Rules.

|     Every entity which is designated as a Possession has an Owner.
|     If no other record exists of the Owner of a given Possession,
|     its Owner is the Bank.
| 
|     Any entity which possesses any Possession, but which does not
|     have an Executor nor is already in Probate, shall be placed in
|     Probate.
| 
|     The Owner of a Possession may transfer the Ownership of that
|     Possession to any other entity capable of owning Plots by
|     sending a message to the Officer responsible for maintaining the
|     record of Ownership of that Possession.  The message shall
|     unambiguously identify the Possession to be transferred and the
|     entity who is to receive ownership of that Possession.  The
|     change of ownership is effective at the time the message is
|     sent, unless the message specifies a later time.

| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 896 be amended by deleting the
paragraph reading "When a Player registers, eir Location is the
Welcoming Center." 

| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended by replacing
| "Moves to the Stasis Chamber" with "announces that e does so in the
| Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the Stasis Chamber" with
| "announces that e does so in the Public Forum".
| 
| 
| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended by deleting the
words "whose Location is the Beer Hall".

| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1711 be amended to read,

      A Degree that has been Granted becomes awarded when the
      recipient notifies the Speaker (or eir Delegate, as described
      below) that e accepts the Degree.

      When a Degree is Granted to a recipient who is not a Player, the
      Speaker shall promptly inform the recipient that e has been
      Granted the degree by some means which has a reasonable
      likelihood of reaching the recipient.  The Speaker may Delegate
      this duty to any other willing Player.

| Be it further resolved, that Rules 1706, 1707, 1708, and 1709 be
| repealed, and further that any and all Locations still remaining in
| existence are destroyed.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1710 be amended to read,
| 
|     There shall exist the Office of Cartographor.  The Cartographor
|     shall retain the records of Ownership of Plots and of Factories.
| 
|     The Official Report of the Cartographor shall contain:
|     * the Location and Ownership of every Plot
|     * the Placement and Ownership of every Factory
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:
| 
|     A Location is an ordered pair of integers.  The first of these
|     two integers is the Longitude of that Location, and the second
|     is the Latitude.  No Longitude may be less than the Minimum
|     Longitude nor greater than the Maximum Longitude.  No Latitude
|     may be less than the Minimum Latitude nor greater than the
|     Maximum Latitude.  Initially, the Minimum Longitude and Minimum
|     Latitude are both 0, and the Maximum Longitude and Maximum
|     Latitude are both 10.  Any of these may be changed
|     (independently of the others) by the action of any Instrument of
|     Power 1 or greater, or by the Cartographor Without Objection,
|     but in no case may the Minimum Longitude be greater than the
|     Maximum Longitude, nor may the Minimum Latitude be greater than
|     the Maximum Latitude.
| 
|     For each possible Location (as detailed above) there exists
|     exactly one Plot.  Plots are Possessions.
| 
|     A Plot may contain Currencies.  For the purposes of the Rules, a
|     Plot's Executor is the same as the Executor of its Owner.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:
| 
|     Factories are a class of entities which may be placed upon
|     Plots.  At most one Factory may be placed upon a Plot, and every
|     Factory is placed on at most one Plot.  The Plot upon which a
|     Factory is placed is called its Placement.  
| 
|     The Owner of a Factory which is not placed upon a Plot may place
|     it upon any Plot which does not already contain a Factory.  The
|     Owner of a Factory which is placed upon a Plot may remove it
|     from that Plot.  The Owner of a Plot may remove any Factory
|     placed upon it.  All of these are accomplished by the Owner of
|     the Factory (or the Plot, in the third case) by sending a
|     message to the Cartographor unambiguously specifying what is to
|     be done.
| 
|     Factories are Possessions.  
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:
| 
|     Each Factory is of a particular Design, and once created as a
|     Factory of that Design cannot be changed to a Factory of another
|     type.  
| 
|     Every Factory consumes and produces units of Currency according
|     to its Design.  The Design for each Factory specifies an input
|     of a positive number of units of a Currency, and an output of a
|     non-negative number of units of a Currency (which need not be
|     distinct from that of the input).
| 
|     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if, in the Plot where a
|     Factory is placed, there exist at least as many units of the
|     input Currency as called for by that Factory's Design, and that
|     Factory is Active, the Factory destroys that many units of the
|     input Currency and creates the number of units of the output
|     Currency as specified in the Design.  The units of Currency thus
|     destroyed are taken from, and the units of Currency thus created
|     are added to, the Plot in which the Factory is Placed.
| 
|     Any Factory which has, for the entire preceding Nomic Week, been
|     Placed in the same Plot, is Active.  All other Factories are
|     Idle.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:
| 
|     A Factory with a given Design may only be created by the Mintor
|     of the Output Currency called for by that Design. 
| 
|     In order to create a Factory, the Mintor of the Output Currency
|     called for in that Design must destroy 4 Ergs, specifying that e
|     does in a message sent to both the Recordkeepor of Ergs and to
|     the Cartographor.  This message must also specify for the
|     Cartographor the Design of the Factory thus created.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:
| 
|     The following standard Factory Designs exist:
| 
|     Mine:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 3 Ergs.
|     House:  Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 P-Note.
|     Farm:   Input is 1 Erg, output is 1 VT.
|     Church: Input is 1 Erg, output is 0 or more Indulgences, as
|     specified elsewhere.
| 
|     The Bank may not create any Factory with a Design other than
|     those given by this Rule.
| 
|     The Bank, upon the request of any entity who also successfully
|     transfers 4 Ergs to the Bank for the purpose of making that
|     request, shall create a Factory of any of these designs and
|     shall transfer ownership of the Factory thus created to the
|     entity thus requesting.
|
