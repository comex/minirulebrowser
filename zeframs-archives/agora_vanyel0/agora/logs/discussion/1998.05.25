My representation of "frequently" was used in the generic sense,
rather than in the sense of "appears frequently in the Ruleset".
Americans, especially, seem to have trouble distinguishing "can" from
"may".

I am the Judge of CFJ 1094, with the responsibility of arbitrating the
validity of the putative Orders contained in Swann's message entitled
"Coup d'etat".

I have read Swann's arguments and I find them prima facie convincing.
I have no opinion in particular as to what the actual effects of the
Orders issued by Swann might be - perhaps, as General Chaos has argued,
they are null in their effects. But that is not what I have been asked
to adjudicate. Nor have I been asked to judge the validity or effects of
the many subsequent amendments to his Orders later issued by Swann, nor
the validity or effects of the Orders issued by Macross. What I must
decide is only whether Swann's original Coup d'etat message contained
valid Orders, ie, whether they contained commands to other Players to
(in this case) refrain from performing certain actions, and whether
these Orders were binding upon the Players to whom they were directed.
As I say, it seems to me that they are.

Nevertheless, I do not want to judge such a grave matter hastily.
Therefore, I call upon Morendil, General Chaos, Macross, and any
other Player who feels they have something to contribute, to submit
to me briefs summarizing their positions on this quetion, if they
feel a Judgement other than TRUE in CFJ 1094 is warranted. Please
address Swann's arguments in your briefs. I will wait 3 days for
submissions.

This Court is adjourned, and will resume on Friday.

Well, with time running out on Swann's 72 hour deadline for vacating my
Orders issued against him, I'm starting to wonder how to proceed.  It
seems that if my Order requiring palindromes was actually issued that
his subsequent orders were criminal.  But, if I am correct, they are
none the less binding on me unless he vacates them.  However, he can't
legally order their vacation unless I give him an Order to do so.
I, of course, am currently enjoined by his Orders not to issue such an
Order!  Have I missed anything?  Any ideas on how to proceed in this
quagmire?

I've just been relooking at the existing Plots law and I see a few problems,
and have some suggestions:

Plots, Structures, and Ergs
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1843/0 (Power=1)
Buying and Selling Plots

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

This is not clear whether or not this Market Value applies only to this
purchase, or to every transaction involving those three plots from then
on. If I transfer ownership of these plots back to the Bank, do I get
any VTs or not?

Also, I think the flat 5 VT value is a bit arbitrary, and might be made
a tuneable parameter, a la "Levers of Monetary Policy".

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by
      transferring the Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the
      sole purpose of buying that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other
      consenting entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes
      to do so.  For the purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always
      deemed to consent to such wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as
      possible after a Plot is transferred to the Bank in this way,
      the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's Market Value to
      the transferring entity.

What if the Plot is involuntarily repossessed?

Also, I think it is more appropriate that the Market Value should be
set in Ergs, not VTs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1844/0 (Power=1)
Winning by Ownership

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank,
      and all Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single
      entity, then that entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition
      known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by
      the Bank.

This is very bad. All Plots are confiscated when someone wins? So 
every player has to purchase them anew? Even if they are recompensed 
at half the Market Value, this is still a significant penalty, especially
when lost production is taken into account.

How about redistributing all Plots anew when this occurs, so each player
reverts to having 3 Plots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1845/0 (Power=1)
Structures

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each
      Structure is assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.
      No entity may own more than five Structures, unless another Rule
      specifies otherwise.

There is no specification in this or any other rule that no more than
one Structure can be assigned to a particular Plot. Also, why is the
five Structure limit imposed, if players can own as many Plots as they
please?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1846/0 (Power=1)
Ergs

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1848/0 (Power=1)
Types of Structures

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.
      E must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the
      Structure is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens,
      the Cartographor shall bill that Player the price of that Type
      of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.
      E must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon
      as possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out
      to that Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1849/0 (Power=1)
Maintenance of Structures

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance
      Fees of all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of
      Structure e owns, at the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that
      Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1850/0 (Power=1)
Production of Structures

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall pay out each Structure's Production to its
      owner, excluding Structures whose Type changed during that Week,
      and excluding Players with a Maintenance Fee that is neither
      satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

If, by R1849 above, the Cartographor issues Maintenance POs immediately
after the end of the week, then there are no Production payments for em
to pay out, because all Players have Maintenance fees pending.

Maintenance should be charged at the beginning of the week, and Production
paid out at the end. Then if no-one has paid the Maintenance fee during
the week, no Production is forthcoming at the end.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1851/0 (Power=1)
Standard Types of Structures

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified
      prices, Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise
      specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to
      be given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two
      Players, and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a
      Church is instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule attempting to prevent Churches from
      having this effect.

Using these figures, one player with 2 Mines and 1 Farm can make 1 VT
and 1 Erg a week, which is more than the current BOS (and much more than
the proposed BOS). Two players working together, one with 3 Mines and
the other with 3 Farms, can produce 3 VTs and 1 Erg a week between 
them.

Ideally we'd like to see the single-player setup produce about as much
as the old unemployment benefits, so that players who do not "work" 
(ie: trade with others) received a minimal basic wage. Officers, who
have to do more work, should receive more than this, as should players
who are willing to form appropriate trading partnerships.

(I am working on the assumption that Kolja's suggestion that Officers
cannot also be land-holders is implemented, which I think is a very 
good idea.)

Is there some way we can make any of these values tuneable so as to 
achieve this sort of effect?

Or how about this for an idea: Eliminate the 3 free Plots, and make 
them all cost. Reinstate unemployment benefits, but only for players
who do not have any land or hold an Office. 

This also eliminates the problem I had with automatically billing 
players Maintenance for their Plots. As long as Plots are the sole 
source of income for unemployed players, I object to automatic billing
because it means that the least committment level of play is unnecessarily
raised. But if unemployment benefits continue to exist, then the least-
committment level is unchanged, but players who are willing to make 
more committment to the game are able to profit because of it.

Just some thoughts. I think now that this thing is worth resuscitating,
if possible, but I want to avoid having the economy go out of control
when we do.

I have two interests in this matter.  The first is to see the
Dictator thwarted in his scam (nothing personal, just part of the
fun of the game :) ).   I found his argument for the validity of
his Orders to be not unreasonable and after a brief look over the
relevant Rules (I dared not wait long else he notice the new
Player loophole) I found nothing that would indicate the Orders
were invalid. I have since not had reason to change my mind in
this regard.

That being said I really hope you can find some cause for them to
be invalid.  If they are invalid the dictator will have been
defeated before ever he got started, and, as you know, it was to
prevent this scam that I once again became a player. 

My second interest in this matter is whether or not Swann's Orders
constitute a crime.  The reason for this is that my subsequent
Orders are of the same nature as Swann's and thus I am in the same
boat.  I can only hope that any Judges on these matters will take
into account the reason why I felt it was necessary to abuse the
Order Rules as I have done (and yes, I do think it abusive).

Well, I've written down a lot of my opinions on the subject, but
it's still too early and too confused to summarize, so don't hold
your breath on my account.

I think the most promising avenue for a discovery of invalidity
probably rests in an examination of what bearing, if any, R1011
might have on this situation. In the Arguments accompanying his
CFJ, Swann rests much of his case on the Permissibility of the
Unprohibited enshrined in R116. But he ignores R1011, which some
in the past have been inclined to interpret as R116's mirror image, a
Prohibition of the Unpermitted. In particular, Swann does not address
the possibility that his Orders might have changed some Nomic
Property via procedures not defined in the Rules. If that can be
shown, then I think his Orders would be shown to be invalid. What
is needed is a plausible candidate Nomic Property to play the required
role.

As for Criminal activity, I have not seen it suggested that Swann's
original message, nor your Counter-Revolution, constituted a Crime,
although some of his subsequent actions (and I suppose some of yours,
too) might have been.

It is precisely a summary of your views that I desire. There have been
150+ messages on this subject posted in the last 3 days, and I don't
have time to wade through them all sifting for all the different arguments
that have been tried, rebutted, tweaked and tried again. Can you prepare
a brief summary by Thursday? Just on the question raised by CFJ 1094?
I don't need you to consider the potentially thornier issues raised by
Macross' intervention and Swann's response to it.

I think I have to agree with Swann here in distinguising between
classes of Orders and types of Orders. R1794 lists four classes of
Orders; I would agree that one cannot issue an Order which is not of
a class defined in R1794. But R1796 refers, perhaps somewhat
cryptically, to the "class and type" of an Order. I think 'type'
here likely refers to whether the Order is a Payment Order, or a
Transfer Order, or some other kind of Order, a distinction among
Orders which is orthogonal to their class. This is the best sense I
can make of R1796.

Officiating at a marriage ceremony is a voluntary act. It does not
follow that the laws of a country or institution cannot empower
specific individuals to perform that act, or prevent other individuals
from performing it. I cannot conduct a Catholic marriage service; only
a priest, empowered by the Catholic Church, can do that.

Or consider an example closer to home, levying taxes. According to
R1853, only a Player specifically empowered to levy a tax on Voting
Tokens is permitted to levy such a tax.

If things are as you describe them, then it seems likely that both
of you will be guilty of committing a some number of Crimes of
Contempt by Action, or Contempt by Inaction, or both. Since each of
these are Class C Crimes, it seems very likely that both of you will
become Lawless, either immediately, or eventually as a result of
incurring further Blot penalties as a result of Persistent Indebtedness
for Indulgences.

My suggestion is that you both throw yourselves upon the mercy of the
Clerk of the Courts, who can pardon Lawless Players...that is to say,
he can pardon one of you (see R1747). The other of you will likely
have to a cop a month's deregistration as punishment. You'd probably
better start the grovelling and the bribery now. 

:)

Or else you could hold a Rebellion and hope that it succeeds. One you
you will be the Miscreant, so that should improve your chances. (Oh,
except that the Miscreant rule still lacks an appropriate precedence
clause, so will have no effect on the probability of success. Oh well.)

Hi all,

For a change, I have some practical questions regarding the current
situation. Of course I have seen all the orders, amendments etc, but
didn't study them in detail yet. What do the prohibit and what can we
still do? Maybe some players can try to give their yes-no answers to
the following questions.

Can I vote on proposals the way I want?

Can I declare presence?

Can I submit proposals?

Can I make transfers to satisfy Payment Orders as a player? 

The same, but limited to TOs that name me as an officer? (e.g. were
Chuck's recent P-note reward POs ok?)

Can I issue Payment Orders required from me by the rules (e.g. rewards
for successful IN proposals?)

Of course, all this is complicated by Macross' counterrevolution. Just
to understand the issued better, maybe we could collect answers to
these questions once for the situation as it is now, and once for the
situation immediately after Swann's coup (assuming that the initial
coup orders were ok). Here is my take on the situation, based on my
cursory reading of the many coup related mails (the first answer is
with couterrrevolution, the second for the inital coup only):

>>
Can I vote on proposals the way I want?
yes/yes

Can I declare presence?
yes/yes

Can I submit proposals?
yes/yes

Can I make transfers to satisfy Payment Orders as a player? 
? / no

The same, but limited to TOs that name me as an officer? (e.g. were
Chuck's recent P-note reward POs ok?)
? / no

Can I issue Payment Orders required from me by the rules (e.g. rewards
for successful IN proposals?)
yes/yes

<<

I wonder what others will say...

Kolja A.


P.S. Although Swann will probably be target of much criticism, Kudo
penalties etc, for the coup itself and the way it was executed, thanks
for the fun anyway - and for the restraint you showed to keep this
nondestructive. I just hope we can also limit this to an episode, and
not waste too much time with chains of CFJs that are only concerned
with sorting out details of an increasingly entangles situation. I
think it would be good to enjoy the coup on the merits of the basic
idea, try to repair the loophole it uncovered and refrain from
identifying and punishing every little mistake, crime and

Obviously need to add a fix for this in the Order Fix proto.

I could be wrong but I seem to recall someone (Scott??) suggested that
they might fall afoul of Rule 1797/0.  Of course, My defense in this
case is that I believed at the time the Orders were valid.  Also, bear
in mind that once Swann made attempts to bind me with Orders, I prefaced
my Order with "I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do
so" which I think affords me a measure of protection, as well as being
Swann's main lever in resurrecting his scam.

   "Rule 1797/0 Abuse of Authority
      Knowingly and willfully executing invalid Orders constitutes the
      Class B Crime of Abuse of Authority."

I think this is a correct assessment particularly in light of the
last paragraph of Rule 1794/0 (Classes of Orders) which reads: "A
Private Order is any other sort of Order."  This is a VERY broad
definition.

I don't think this will fly, since there _is_ a defined procedure, namely 
the one of making the Orders themselves:


Rule 1808/0 (Power=1)
Administrative and Private Orders

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

      Private Orders are executed by submitting them directly to the
      Player to be commanded, and take effect upon submission.

Oh, great!  I don't know how Swann stands financially but as a new
player I suspect I am most likely dirt poor.  What assets do new 
players start out with?

I think there is a possible solution to this situation.  Would it be
Kosher for Swann and I to amend our Orders such that they we are no
longer in this bind?  In other words, and CFJ have to take into account
the final form of the Orders or could they consider the form of the
Orders at the time amendments were made.  If so we could each issue
Orders on the condition that the other issues the necessary Orders.
Looks like Swann and I might have to join forces after all.

Not much better than yourself, I'm afraid :(
Somewhat wose due to a few blots I've collected already :( x2
Much worse since I've CFJ'd on the one criminal act I believe
I've done :( x many.

Actually, my Orders are already amended, you can make any Order you
wish-- as long as I approve it beforehand.  A clumsy mechanisim, but
one that-- for sure-- works.  Which means you're pretty safe from
prosecution if you want to be.

Me, well, I knew the job was dangerous when I took it.  But the actual
scam aside, the resulting debate is interesting enogh that I might
consider it worth a short time deregistered.

This is why I didn't bring up 1011, though I probably should've for
completeness' sake.  I though that the defined mechanisim was not only
obvious enough to deflect any invotation of 1011, but obvious enough
that I neededn even adress the issue.

Well, it obviously didn't go as smoothly as I had planned.  The idea,
before I panicked and jumped the gun, was to draft a set of Orders that
prevented anyone else from abusing the system, and then dive right into
proposing the fix.  Unfortunatly, I've been very edgy ever since I saw
the loophole, and the moment it seemed someone might possibly see it, I
pounced-- probably, make that definatly, prematurly.  My original intent
was only to issue one other set of Orders, the one instructing everyone
to vote for the fix I'd propose.

Fortunatly, the situation, as well that the pragmatic nature of Orders,
means that the "entanglement" caused by this scam is limited to the
status of a few actions of mine and Macross' (Whether my last amendment
was Crime, which I think it isn't, and whether Macross' last order was
ever actually made, which I think it wasn't.)  All the other happenings,
for a scam of this scope, are refreshingly determinate.  I am certian
that everyone is pretty certian of the state of things now, with the
possible exception of my arguable criminal status re:my last amendments.

IMO it was inevitable that there would be a scam or a crisis with the
Order Rules before long.  It seems to be our basic method for ironing
out the kinks in new legislation :)

I don't recall Scott, or anyone else, suggesting that. Obviously
neither you nor Swann believed your Orders were invalid, so Abuse of
Authority is not really an issue. Scott moved a Judicial Motion that
the Orders be vacated, whereupon Swann used another loophole to
prevent any Judges from doing that.

I present a little bit of analysis concerning making the Maintenance Fee a 
parameter that can be tuned by the Cartographor. Based on a simplified 
model of just Mines and Farms, the table below shows how the number of 
Farms a player can support (and hence eir VT income) depends on the number
of Mines e runs, and the Maintenance Fee (which is assumed to be uniform
for all kinds of Structures).

                       Maintenance Fee (Ergs)
 
      | 0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6
    --+------------------------------------------------------------
 M  1 |  1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0
 i  2 |  6    4    3    2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0    0
 n  3 | 11    8    7    5    4    4    3    2    2    1    1    1
 e  4 | 16   12   10    8    7    6    5    4    3    3    2    2
 s  5 | 21   16   13   11    9    8    6    5    5    4    3    3

                 Number of Farms that can be supported

Note that due to the 5 Structure/Player limit, those entries where the
total number of structures exceeds five will need to be spread over 
two or more players. (Note also, that the statistics are incorrect for
the case in which the farms are owned by two or more players, as the MF
would increase by 1 erg per additional player.)

For a single player arrangement, taking into account these limits, we 
have:

                       Maintenance Fee (Ergs)
 
      | 0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6
    --+------------------------------------------------------------
 M  1 |  1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0
 i  2 |  3*   3*   3    2    2    2    1    1    1    0    0    0
 n  3 |  2*   2*   2*   2*   2*   2*   2*   2    2    1    1    1
 e  4 |  1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*   1*
 s  5 |  0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0*   0* 

The star indicates that there is a significant surplus of Ergs
(enough to fund an additional Structure, if it were possible.)
This gives an interesting curve for the optimal single-player 
setup, based on MF, (assuming we first want to maximise VTs, then
Ergs):
                       Maintenance Fee (Ergs)
 
      | 0.5  0.6  0.7  0.8  0.9  1.0  1.1  1.2  1.3  1.4  1.5  1.6
    --+------------------------------------------------------------
 M  1 | 
 i  2 |  3*   3*   3    
 n  3 |                 2*   2*   2*   2*   2    2    
 e  4 |                                               1*   1*   1*
 s  5 | 

Based on this (admittedly over-simplified) analysis, I'd advise that
we change the output of each Farm to 0.5 VTs, and make the MF a parameter
that can be set by the Cartographor. By only allowing em to vary the 
MF, e is limited in eir ability to victimise particular players. 
Obviously greater control could be facilitated by allowing em to 
manipulate the Production Rates directly, but I think this gives em
too much power to pick on individuals.

If we follow Kolja's suggestion that Officers are not landholders,
then we may have some interesting political situations result. The
Cartographor will have control over other players' incomes, but not
eir own, unless e was also the Chancellor. Perhaps we should have a
rule stating that the Chancellor and Cartographor must always be
different players.

A bug in Murphy's "Plot Repair":

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with this text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially
      owned by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name
      Without Objection.            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Create a Rule entitled "Adjacency" with this text:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.
      Two Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

      For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y)
      from 0 to 9:

        * If a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" 
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          and the Longitude for "Y") already exists, its Latitude and 
          Longitude are set to X and Y, respectively.
        * If no such Plot exists, then a Plot with that name, Latitude and
          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
          Longitude is created.

The underlined portions indicate that whenever a player changes the
name of one of eir Plots, from "Area XY" to something else, a new
Plot with name "Area XY" will have to be created.

Also, I feel that these rules are too Platonic about how Plots are 
created. They should be explicitly created or destroyed by the 
Cartographer in a message to the PF, as it is with Currencies (R1471).

What, anyway, is the point of Adjacency? At the moment, it seems to
be without any purpose. I'd prefer not to clutter the ruleset with 
extra definitions, unless they are actually going to be used.
