I'm still not sure I like this. Admittedly, we did a similar thing with
Powers, but I don't think you should define non-fungible entities as
Currencies...

"Units of energy"? Yuck. What's the scientific term for one unit of work
energy?

I think the existing Currency mechanisms are useful enough to justify
basing Plots on them.  Perhaps the one idea I added (TOs and POs must
specify which Plots they refer to, and can't make anyone go negative)
could be adapted into a general framework for non-fungible Currencies?

Right, that'll go into the next version.

I guess I'll rename them "ergs".

I basically just renamed "Structure" to "Working Mule"; I don't think any of
the fundamental mechanisms have changed.

I disagree. I just don't think one week is long enough. I could accept
a compromise of 2 weeks.

Who said anything about the bulk of the Rules? The Virus has been
operating in its current form or about 8 months, and this is probably
the first time we've had to consider upmutation as a response. I
think the Rule that underpins Transfer Orders is a pretty damn
important Rule and deserves upmutation on those grounds. All the
Virus has done is to bring this fact to our attention. Your response
is to shoot the messenger.

I think history has shown by now that amending Power = 2 Rules is
eminently feasible.

Why is three weeks far too long to wait before ratifying one of the
most important documents in the game? What situation is it that you dread,
that you hope to avoid by ratifying after just 7 days?

Perhaps not, but saying "I have a negative amount of money." is an
acceptable way of saying "I am in debt." in my opinion.

I think you'll find that Oerjan wrote R1729, not me. As for the Kudo
transfer, no taking of the moral high ground should be inferred. Let
me repeat that I have the highest respect for your style of play. 
Nevertheless, it was a violation of the Rules for strategic purposes,
yes? I just think the pursuit of such strategies should not be without
risks.

Ah, I was hoping that someone would make this comment!  Suppose that
we do hold that a negative balance is a debt.  A debt to who?  The
Bank seems to be the obvious choice.  Then what is a negative balance
in the Bank?  A debt to the Bank?  That's absurd!

The "negative balance == debt" concept is absurd when there is no
central lending authority.  We have no central lending authority.

Sigh. Economics is not my forte, regrettably. Still, I'll try to
press on with what limited understanding I have of such matters.

What reason is there for denying that a negative balance in the Bank
simply means that the Chancellor should mint that many units of
Currency in order to cancel the debt? Sure, it's technical, but it's
not absurd.

Neither do I! It should add some extra interest to the prosecutory

You're creating an obligation out of thin cloth.  I'd say that you
need support in the Rules to accomodate that interpretation, and that
supoprt does not exist.

I have yet to be presented with a reasonable model of absolute
possession in which negative possessed quantities has a reasonable
interpretation.  The obvious one, that the negative quantity
represents a debt, fails because without a debtor there cannot be a
debt, and there is no entity capable of acting in the role of debtor.
The other arguments I have seen rely solely on Rule 116 for support,
but the permissibility of a thing does not ensure its possibility.
Given the lack of a convincing reason why it should be possible for an
entity--especially the Bank--to possess a negative quantity of a
Currency, and the obvious problems with doing so, I must refuse to
recognize the attempts to attribute the possession of negative
quantities to the Bank as illogical and impossible.

Why not the Bank itself? The case where we regard the Bank as in
debt to itself seems to me a degenerate case, but not an absurd one.

I'm not going to press the matter; I don't care that much. I'll leave
it to others if they can be bothered. The only issue of substance (and
not much substance at that) is whether 'RGB II' has self repealed or not.

That sounds interesting. I could support that.

I agree with you that the Assessor's job has probably become too onerous,
and I now think I will support the suggestions being made by Scott and
yourself which will enable the splitting of the Assessor's functions
into two roles: one a VT recordkeepor and the other a vote tallyer.
These are the 'reforms of the system' that we need.

What I don't understand, and what I don't think anyone has demonstrated
satisfactorily, is what any of this has to do with the Virus.

Proto-Proposal
Bring Back Public Voting

[Comment: the Public Voting Experiment seems to have been popular,
but the renumbering of the Rule which brought it into being means
that it will end on Dec 23, since P3634 no longer amends the correct
Rule. I propose to bring it back quickly.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Public Voting", be
created with the following text:
