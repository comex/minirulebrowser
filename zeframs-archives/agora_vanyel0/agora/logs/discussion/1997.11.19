It doesn't matter if Public Voting becomes permanent, but currently, once
Public Voting is over, the rule as written would allow the Vote Collector
to reveal a Player's current Vote, if that Player had made any Vote or
Presence declaration to the PF, even if e later made a (different) Vote
in a private mail to the Vote Collector.

While I'm sure I'll get fried for this, I agree with Crito on this issue. Why?
I certainly agree with the argument that Plato can most likely not possess 
anything. But I've never fully agreed with the poker-chip metaphor -- we are
*not* passing around physical tokens here, but bits of information recorded in
files. While I agree that we certainly couldn't actually put physical "VTs" into
Plato's possession (exhumation notwithstanding), I feel that, in absence of a
Rule to the contrary, any entity can possess currencies.

RL currency actualy apepars in both forms. Hard currency, as in monopoly,
or poker chips is really just a small part of all currency. Most
transactions take place on paper.  So of one were to push the face to face
analogy, or RL analogy a bit further, one'd right back at the point that
says it doesn't matter which of these represetations one chooses to
follow, and that representation has no bearing on the issue.

As for a dead man's ability to own property, that is a construct of law.
If one would be granted another small venture into evolution of law, in a
pre-legal society (is there such a thing?)  when a person died, presumaby
e immediately ceased to own all things, and they would be free for the
taking.  With th evolution of the concepts of society, family and
ownership, what was previously refered to as 'proper disposing of the
belongings' was developed.

I don't know about other places, but here I was told bya lawyer, that when
he is the Executor of a will, he acts as the representative of the heirs.
That is - he petitions the court that a will exists, and the legal heirs
are so and so, and the court recognizes the legality of the whole thing
and permits the lawyer to distribute the inheritance according to the will
- and once the heirs say that they are satisfied with it, the court may
set a fee to be paid from the heirs to the Executor.  So even in this
instance, there is no real concept of property owned by the dead person
any more.

Happy to support it, but I don't know about the description of the crisis
as 'Great' (or even a crisis). Seems more like Oerjan's leadership averted
what would or could have been a crisis altogether.

Yes, indeed, the search for a solution to the Sorites paradox is one
of the main motivations for the development of fuzzy logic. Unfortunately,
as Tim Williamson demonstrates in his excellent book _Vagueness_, fuzzy
logic has many other problems, especially in defining how the logical
connectives work and with the notion of what constitutes a valid argument.

Strange as it seems to me, Williamson actually defends the view which
I described above as absurd, that there is some number of grains of
sand N, such that N grains is not a heap, but N+1 is a heap. He claims
that we merely cannot know what this number N is. I still find this
view quite bewildering. What strange creatures philosophers are!

I'm curious; why should we not interpret Rule 103 as trumping Rule
1664 and barring a non-Player Speaker Elect from becoming Speaker?  It
seems to me that Rule 103 and Rule 1664 are in conflict (Rule 1664
seeks to make a non-Player Speaker; this violates Rule 103's mandate
that every Player is either a Voter or the Speaker by causing every
Player to be a Voter and no Player to be the Speaker).  We have chosen
to resolve this conflict by elevating the non-Player Speaker-Elect to
the status of Playerhood despite the lack of any procedure within the
Rules for doing so (in violation of Rule 1011).  It seems to me that
the more proper resolution of this conflict is to adjudge that Rule
1664's attempt to change Speaker is voided by conflict with Rule 103.

This would, of course, mean that Morendil is not Speaker.

I suspect that it just never occurred to anyone.  I think it's a better
interpretation of the Rules than anything previously suggested.

Which IMHO it is a misnomer to call these things currencies.  The term
brings too much RL baggage that forces us to try to adapt RL processes
into an arena that isn't suited for them.  Better to call them something
unique and allow our own standards and practices evolve.

EiPs no longer have the right to cast Player's votes for them.

Rule 103:

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.


The first and second sentences do not put any requirement on the Speaker
to be a Player - it would be consistent with those for all Players to be
Voters and for the Speaker to be a non-Player.

The last sentence is phrased as a definition of "Player", and it is not
natural to read it as a restriction on Speakerhood.

I am somewhat bothered about this way of judging. It is my view that if a
Judge cannot find sufficient evidence to make one outcome reasonably
certain, e should dismiss the CFJ, not Judge it TRUE or FALSE.

I noticed the same bothered me when I was Appeal Justice for the CFJ
whether Scott had committed improper COE denial, and the other Justices
voted for FALSE.

Of course, there is that "preponderance of the evidence" clause in some
Rule or other, but the preponderance of the evidence is that there
probably is important evidence missing or insufficiently considered...

For the Scott case, the no reasonable doubt requirement would prevent a
Judgement of TRUE but says nothing about whether the CFJ should be FALSE
or Dismissed.

Ørjan.

This is very interesting.  I agree that what we are talking about are two
different kinds of ownership, which may be contributing to the disagreements. 
What you call "strong-ownership", seems to require an act of will on the part
of the owner.  That would limit such ownership to living persons.  It is not
the kind of ownership I thought we have in Agora.

But even your "weak-ownership" depends on applicable laws (by your own words),
or on the inability of the dead person to enforce their ownership, to dispose
of a dead persons properties .  It is not an inherent property of dead people
which provides a logical, non-legislative argument as to why a dead person may
cease to be capable of "weak-owning" things at some point later than the actual
moment of death, rather it is a property of the surrounding culture (consider
the culture of ancient Egypt).  It is the general will of the living in most
cultures to retain control of "useful" property in the hands of the living.  Up
to this point I had believed that such general will in Agora could only be
implemented explicitly via the Rules.

I'm confused here.  If every Player is a Voter, then every Player is still
either a Voter *or* the Speaker.  How does the fact that no Player is the
Speaker violate this mandate?

I agree that it's ambiguous, but Game Custom supports the latter

All very interesting.  From my naive viewpoint, the problem with these
arguments seems to come from the fact that a "heap" is not defined by the
single property of the number of elements but rather by a combination of the
number of elements and their configuration.  Looking at things larger than
grains of sand (like blocks, for instance), P2 above seems trivially false (I
put a third block on top of two, side-by-side blocks).  So the resolution of
the paradox involves answering the question, given a particular configuration
of N grains of sand which is not a heap, is there a way to place another grain
of sand on it that turns it into a heap?  Since there is no single N (it
depends on the configuration), and it seems to be easily true on a small scale
for small N (very small "heaps"), I'm not so sure the denial of P2 leads to as
much of an absurd conclusion as accepting P2.  The fuzzy part seems to come
into deciding which configurations of a particular N are heaps, and which are
not.

This does appear to be a well-reasoned argument in support of the
customary reading.

Yes, it is, in a way.  Entities with Executors are capable of
"strong-ownership" because their Executors are empowered to exercise
the same degree of control that a natural person would.

A further thought.  The difficulty of determining which configurations of N
grains are a heap is one problem (where relative values of "heapness" may be
useful).  A separate problem is finding a mapping of those configurations of N
grains which are not heaps into those configurations of N+1 grains which *are*
heaps.  The difficulty of finding such a mapping where the configuration of the
N grains is contained within the configuration of N+1 grains seems to be the
source of the "paradox".  But expressed this way, it doesn't seem like such a
paradox to me, especially since mapping transitions from lower values of
"heapness" to higher values of "heapness" (rather than the all or nothing of
the paradox statement) may make a resolution easier and sound less absurd.  Of
course there is still the problem of determining the relative "heapness" value
of a configuration.

Yes; your Votes were not noted because I typoed when recording them in

It is news to me that this is the default kind of ownership in Agora.  So the
result of this would be that, unless a Rule explicitly grants ownership to an
entity, only living persons and entities with Executors may possess Currencies.
Is this really the consensus?  Seems to me there should be no restriction to
either strong- or weak-ownership unless it is so specified in the Rules.

I think calling them "Objects" is a bad idea too; the term is way too
vague, specifically failing to reflect the fungibility of Currencies.

I haven't made my mind up yet.  Probably won't, unless (of course) I
am properly Justiciar for the Appeal, in which case I'll have to. :)

Understood.  I selected the Justices as soon as I read your call for appeal
last night, when Steve was still Justiciar.  I typed the e-mail at that
time but did not send it until the morning.  The change of Justiciar in the
meantime does not  alter the composition of the selected (but not
announced) Board.

Perhaps I should have written "Steve (J, at the time of selection)" to be
more clear.

For each week, I believe is the custom. If Harlequin hasn't produced
a Mad Scientist's Report for over a month, oughtn't he to habe been
removed for Dereliction? Does the Mad Scientist have an Official Report?

This kind of misses the point, which isn't really about heaps per se, but
about vague predicates. Some wit suggested years ago that P2 was false
for heaps, and that the number N in question is obviously 3: no arrangement
of 3 grains of sand makes a heap, but 4 grains of sand, arranged in a
tetrahedron, make a heap. But now consider the same argument for 'young'

P1. New-born infants are young.
P2. Nothing that is young at time T ceases to be young one second
    after T.
C.  (by induction) Ninety year old persons are young.

Now, once again, Williamson says that there is a time T such that at T
you are young, but one second after T you are not young, even if we cannot
know what T is.

Well, if you assume that heap-ness is 'fuzzy' (not neccessarily 
true/false, but possibly somewhere between the two), the paradox 
disappears: a pile of sand gets more and more heap-ish with each 
grain of sand, but doesn't transform from completely not being a heap 
to completely being a heap with a single grain. In other words, you 
can escape if being a heap and not being a heap are not the only 
two options; there's also at least one degree of sort-of being a 
heap.

Although I can't see anything wrong with this, I think this may be the
first time that time of selection has been distinguished from time of
posting in this way. The only thing that troubles me about it is that
we have absolutely no way of verifying that what you say is true. 

Given that this is a game played over the Internet by the exchange of
messages, perhaps it's time we introduced a kind of 'no private events'
Rule?

The idea is to move away from a system in which some or most Currency
transfers are mandated by the Rules and merely detected and reported
Recorddkeepors, to a system where the Rules merely impose requirements
on Players to make transfers (Payment Orders), which Players then
satisfy by making transfers (Transfer Orders). This means that
Recordkeepors don't have to worry about missing Rule-mandated
Transfers: if there hasn't been a Transfer Order, there hasn't been a
transfer. Similarly, Players can be sure that if there hasn't been
a Payment Order, then they aren't required to pay. The major disadvantage
of the system is the increase in 'paperwork' it involves: this is held
to be the cost of certainty.

Hmm.  Would that require the use of dice servers for random selection?
We've always put some measure of trust in our Officers to make
random determinations fairly, and taken them at their word
that they have done so.  I don't see that there's much
difference here.

Well spotted! My current intention is to propose to make the PVE
'permanent' (ie, to propose to amend away the self-Repeal clause
in R1741), in about 2 weeks time. I'll make a separate Proposal
to fix the bug.

I think I agree with Crito and Oerjan: there is no conflict here.
If every Player is a Voter and no Player is the Speaker (because 
a non-Player is the Speaker), the first sentence of R103 is not
violated. I read the last sentence of R103 as making the word
'Player' in the Ruleset refer to the Speaker, even if the Speaker
is not a Player. I regard this provision as equivalent in effect
to: if the Speaker is not a Player, then e shall be deemed to be
a Player for all legal purposes.

The idea behind the remark was not to force Officers to use dice-servers
to make random selections, although I can see that the way I expressed
myself above does make it look that way. I think it has more to do
with the legally effective timing of selection rather than the method used.

But of course, I can see the problems with this idea. The Rules require,
for example, the CotC to make a random selection from among the eligible
Players. The CotC has no choice in determining who the eligible Players
are but to use the list of Players eligible Players at the time e makes
eir selection. But there is always a delay between selection and publication
of the results of the selection, and in that time the list of eligible
Player may change (akin to what has happened in this case with the identity
of the Justiciar). So perhaps a 'no private events' Rule *would* force
the use of dice-servers for random selection, even though that's not what
I intended. Hm.

Is the above provision effective?  I tend to think it is:
although usually only comments with no effect are placed
in brackets, there is no Rule to the effect that text in
brackets is without effect.  And one cannot argue Game Custom
that it is ineffective, because (at least as far as I
know) there has never previously been any text in brackets
which might have had an effect.  Thus, I tend to believe that
the above is effective, by R594, but I thought I'd solicit
others' opinions.

Can you give me a few concrete examples of how everyday events occur 
within this framework? Say:

1) I am required to pay a penalty to the Bank.
2) Of my own desire, I pay a certain amount to the Bank to pay for some 
   service.
3) I transfer some amount of currency to another player.

What would be the proper sequence of actions in each of these cases?
How does this new system help to handle mistakenly called for penalties,
or mistakenly attempted transfers (if, say, the player does not have the
currency to make the transfer)?

Also, how explicit to I need to be, for doing things which require such
transfers, like voting, proposing, etc?

Or, as I would phrase it, the Speaker is a Player, even if e
would not be in the absence of R103.

I took elJefe's comments to indicate that e believed the fixed portion
of the Board was determined at the time the appeal was perfected, and
not at the time it was announced.  I was not Justiciar at the time the
appeal was perfected, so it is proper that I not serve as Justiciar.

Are you certain that there has never been any other text in brackets
which might have had an effect, had you chosen to interpret it as
other than a comment? It seems to me that I often accompany my Proposals
with comments like: 

[Comment: I propose to amend Rule 666 to fix the bug discovered by
Fred.]

A very uncharitable interpretation of this Comment might have it that
this actually has the effect of changing the text of Rule 666 so that
it reads 'fix the bug discovered by Fred.'

Whether this has any bearing on the current case, I leave it up to
you to decide.

What does 'perfected' mean, precisely? Surely not the time the third
call for Appeal reached the PF. The time Jeff made his selection?
Do the Rules justify privileging that time? Perhaps they do...

I do not believe that it offends the Rules or Game Custom to hold that

all.

Say you commit the Infraction of Failure to Report. The Registrar is
responsible for detecting the commission of the Infraction, and announcing
your penalty. Until e does so, you are under no obligation. He does so
by executing a Payment Order for the amount of the penalty naming you
as the Payor and the Bank as the Payee (actually, for FtR it's two POs).
Once e's done that, you are required to satisfy the Payment Order by
making a Transfer Order to the Bank for the amount named in the PO. 
You do that by sending a message to the appropriate RK saying "I transfer
<amount, Currency> to the Bank to satisfy such-and-such Payment Order."
I'm not entirely clear whether it's necessary to say exactly which PO
you're satisfying. "I hereby transfer <amount, Currency> to the Bank"
might well be sufficient.

>2) Of my own desire, I pay a certain amount to the Bank to pay for some

"I transfer etc" as above.

"I transfer <amount, Currency> to <Player>" as above.

>How does this new system help to handle mistakenly called for penalties,

If the Registrar mistakenly cites you for FtR and executes POs against
you, you can dispute the POs. If the Registrar admits the mistake, he
can vacate the POs, removing any obligation pplaced upon you to satisfy them.
If you've already satisfied them, then I think the Registrar has to 
execute a new PO from the Bank to you to recompense you. In the interim,
you don't actually have the Currency you paid, even though in a sense
you should have done.

>or mistakenly attempted transfers (if, say, the player does not have the

In that case, the RK announces that your attempted TO failed.

Voting happens as before, as far you're concerned. You just send your
votes in. According to R1442, this act comprises the submission of
an implicit delayed Transfer Order for VTs, to be executed at the end
of the VP.

The relevant Officer or other official will state that you are
required to make a transfer to the Bank; such a statment that
a transfer is required is called a Payment Order (PO).  e.g.,
"For making emself ineligible to Judge CFJ 4444 after e had been
selected, Blob is hereby required to pay 0.5 VT to the Bank."
You would then make such a transfer, by announcing so either
to the PF or to the Recordkeepor for VTs, and also stating
that the transfer was for the purpose of fulfilling that PO.  This
announcement is called a Transfer Order (TO).

If you fail to make the TO within a certain time, the Recordkeepor
will announce that you are guilty of Persistent Indebtedness,
and issue a PO requiring you to pay a certain number of Indulgences
to the Bank.  If you have outstanding, overdue, non-disputed
POs requiring you to pay a total of 30 or more Indulgences
to the Bank, you can be deregistered for Lawlessness.

>2) Of my own desire, I pay a certain amount to the Bank to pay for some

You simply state that you are doing so (again, either to the PF
or to the Recordkeepor for that Currency), and the purpose for which you
are doing so.

>3) I transfer some amount of currency to another player.

Again, simply state that you do so.

>How does this new system help to handle mistakenly called for penalties,

Let's say the COTC was in error in issuing the PO in #1.  He then
announces that the PO is vacated.  If you have not already satisfied
the PO (i.e., made the TO required by that PO), no further action
is required (beyond the Recordkeepor noting that the PO has been
vacated).  If you have satisfied the PO, the Recordkeepor will
issue a PO requiring the Bank to return your 0.5 VTs, and
the Chancellor, as the Bank's Executor, will have to transfer
0.5 VTs from the Bank to you.

>or mistakenly attempted transfers (if, say, the player does not have the
>currency to make the transfer)?

The Recordkeepor will inform you and the intended recipient that
you had insufficient funds for the transfer, and thus it did
not take place.

>Also, how explicit to I need to be, for doing things which require such
>transfers, like voting, proposing, etc?

In most cases you need to be quite explicit about the transfer.
Voting is a special case, in that voting constitutes an Implicit
Transfer Order (which is also delayed until the end of the Voting Period.)
In other words, when you vote, you need not explicitly state
that you are transferring the appropriate number of VTs
to the Bank.

Malcolm> 1) I am required to pay a penalty to the Bank.

Someone (normally, an Officer) posts to the Public Forum that you are
required to pay a certain amount of Currency to the Bank.  The
Recordkeepor of that Currency records this obligation.

You are then obliged to transfer that amount of Currency to the Bank,
at the same time specifying that you do so for the purpose of
satisfying that obligation; you do this by sending a message to the
Recordkeepor of the relevant Currency specifying the aforementioned
information.  (Most people achieve this by posting to the Public
Forum, but this is not required.) 

Malcolm> 2) Of my own desire, I pay a certain amount to the Bank to

I think the only case where that applies presently is the payment of
Petition Fees (Rule 1702).  A message to the RK of the relevant
Currency stating that you are transferring the specified amount to the
Bank for the specified purpose is required and sufficient.  (In
theory, it may be necessary to send the message to the Public Forum or
to more than one person; but I am not aware of any.)

Voting is an exception to this; the Transfer Orders required for
Voting are implicit in the act of Voting; you need do nothing special
in order to pay for your Votes.

Malcolm> 3) I transfer some amount of currency to another player.

Send a message to the RK of the Currency stating that you are
transferring the specified amount of Currency.   

Malcolm> What would be the proper sequence of actions in each of these

Detailed above, I hope.

Malcolm> How does this new system help to handle mistakenly called for

Malcolm> player does not have the currency to make the transfer)?

If you feel a penalty is improperly applied, instead of paying it, you
dispute it.  The Payment Order thus arising can be vacated, by the
person who originally made it, or, in some cases, a Judge (or the
Clerk of the Courts for penalties related to Infractions) if
improperly applied.

There is no recourse if you make a transfer by mistake.  If a transfer
fails because it would overdraft the payor, the Recordkeepor is
obliged to inform both payor and payee ASAP.

Malcolm> Also, how explicit to I need to be, for doing things which
Malcolm> require such transfers, like voting, proposing, etc?

Voting, as mentioned above, is implicit.  In general, liberal
construction of putative Transfer and Payment Orders is required,
pursuant to a recent CFJ, so there is no mandated form of expression
to be followed.

Nope, it's the Recordkeepor(s), not the Registrar who issues
the PO from the Bank.  It would have been the Registrar in
an early draft of PC, but I pointed out that the Registrar
might not know whether or not the original PO had been satisfied,
whereas the Recordkeepor would.

The responsibility to execute reversing POs lies with each

I tend to think that the Board should be selected based on the
conditions prevailing at the moment that it becomes necessary to
select a Board.  In the case of an Appeal, this would mean the moment
that the criteria for an Appeal are met, which is what I mean by
the Appeal being "perfected."

(In real-life practice, an appeal is "perfected" when the lower court
has assembled and transmitted the complete record of the case under
review to the higher court, as required by the higher court's writ of
certiorari.  Since we have no such practice, I have hijacked the term
to mean simply that the appeal is "ripe" and ready to be heard.)

Nope, I'm not entirely certain that there has never been any text
in brackets which would not have had an effect.  If you could
produce such an example, I would certainly reconsider
my conclusion.  However, I found no such example in my back records
of Proposals (which, admittedly, only go back 4-5 months.)

As to your example above, I note two things which I believe are
relevant and differentiate it from P3596.  First, your comment
is clearly marked "Comment:" as are many comments in brackets
(or variations, such as "Comments:" or "Explanation:") which
I would regard as a clear indication that the text was to
be without effect.

Second, I believe your text would be without effect even if
not in brackets and preceded by "Comment:".  The natural reading
of "Amend Rule 666 to fix the bug discovered by Fred" is not
to amend Rule 666 to "fix the bug discovered by Fred," but
to amend Rule 666 in such a way that the bug is fixed; the Rule
Change would not take place due to its ambiguity.  It might
be a different story if the formatting were different.  For
example,

Amend Rule 666 to

      fix the bug discovered by Fred.

might have the effect you suggest, but I know of no comments which
have been formatted this way.

DIS: P3596: Opinions sought

I tend to agree that it is effective.  The Rules do not specify that text
within brackets must be ignored.

-- Crito

Is the above provision effective?  I tend to think it is:
although usually only comments with no effect are placed
in brackets, there is no Rule to the effect that text in
brackets is without effect.  And one cannot argue Game Custom
that it is ineffective, because (at least as far as I
know) there has never previously been any text in brackets
which might have had an effect.  Thus, I tend to believe that
the above is effective, by R594, but I thought I'd solicit
others' opinions.
