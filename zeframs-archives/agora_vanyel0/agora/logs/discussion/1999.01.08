I just noticed this myself while building back records for the
Promotor.  My mail archive browser presents the messages to me in Date 
order (well, actually, I can have them presented in any order I want,
but that's the default) and when I came across Morendil's messages
satisfying those Payment Orders, I hit "Transfer" and went to record
the transfers, but the Payment Orders weren't there.

Morendil is advised to check his clock.

I'm up to 21-Dec-1998 in building parallel Promotor's records, and
should be up to date within a day or two.  The interface I've built is 
rather nice, if I do say so myself. :)

Can you fix the problem?

Alternatively, please clearly describe the effect of the problem so
as to avoid confusion in the future (and so I can code a special
exemption into my handling software to adjust for your broken clock).

It should be OK now... I had it set to GMT+2, which is one hour off 
from the actual time zone of France during winter/spring, which is GMT+1.
I always forget to change TZ when we switch from one to the other.

It doesn't change automatically?  I happen to live in one of the more
enlightened areas of the world that doesn't observe "summer time", but 
my understanding is that most computers are programmed to change
automatically.

I'm glad someone agrees with me.  (For those of you not in the
know, Scott and I both live in Indiana, most of which does not
observe daylight savings time.)  Another friend of mine in Indiana
calls it "IST--Indiana Stupid Time", on the grounds that he thanks
we should sheepishly follow most of the rest of the U.S.  My response
is "IST--Indiana Sensible Time."  :)

It doesn't appear to be necessary to perform a formal COE; my
substantive right has been vindicated by informal process, and as it
appears that I will be succeeding Blob as Promotor I don't need to
rely on formal power to correct the error in the records.
