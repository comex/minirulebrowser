Well, AGAINST.  Internomic is supposed to be a Nomic of Nomics, not a
Nomic of Liaisons.  You are effectively suggesting that we remove most of
what little Player participation we have.

Oerjan has a point.  How about a compromise?  Let the Ambassador vote at eir discretion in case of a tie and/or failed quorum.

I don't think so, I just think that player participation will be less
formally structured than a Referendum. I imagine a good Ambassador
will poll the rest of the players to ascertain there opinions before
voting. And if e fails to represent those opinions often enough, e is
not likely to hold onto eir office very long. 

It would still be a nomic of nomics, because we would expect the 
Ambassador to represent our interests, not just eir own, and we would
do what was appropriate to make sure e does so. This proto just allows
us to do so in a more flexible and (imho) interesting way.

Either way, we will have exactly as much player participation as we
have participating players. It's just a matter of whether those players 
control our internomic voting directly by referendum, or indirectly by
political means. I think the latter course would be more entertaining.
That is why I suggest it.
