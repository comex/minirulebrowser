That still leaves the question of just what restriction is imposed, 
and how effective 1729 is in imposing it. For instance, is "in 
public" strictly equivalent to "by a posting to the Public Forum" ? 
What about the 'employer and professor' clause ? ;)

I'm aware of that, but I don't see a good way to deal with this, 
short of instituting some form of exchange which could be used to 
determine the market value, in terms of the ratio of offer and 
demand, of a given Currency.

That does seem to be necessary. I'm toying with the idea of having
the Chancellor maintain a list of Traded Currencies, which are
Currencies which meet certain criteria such that they would be
allowed in Bids; it would be a pity if custom Currencies were not
usable for anything but scamlets such as the above. One of the more
interesting ideas behind custom Currencies is that I should be able
to mint, for instance, MoTokens, and have a Policy making those
redeemable for services I can perform, such as Voting on some
Proposals. In this case MoTokens would have a definite market value 
and should be usable in, for instance, an Auction.

It is not sufficient in the first case, as the Judgement does not
find me guilty of a Crime; it is sufficient in the second, as I am a 
Player named in the Injunction.

"Cloneliness is next to godliness. Right !"  - Steve Taylor.

I like the way Steve Taylor takes the self-righteousness and self-importance of
church-goers ("Christians") and stuffs it up there collective noses.  :o)

Maybe we should continue this discussion outside of the PF. (Then again maybe not,
they might learn something.  ;o)

btw how about a bio from you ?

Bumma, I liked the virus. The FM didn't look too good (but then a monster aint
s'posed to <g>), so I'm glad it's gone.

If this group is gonna be all politics then I'll run away. Rules I can really
enjoy, loopholes, fixes, etc., all good fun. Politics don't rub with my logical
mind, backstabbing, floor crossing, lies, yuk, too illogical.

I'll have to increase the levity level around here I reckon. I am going to erect
a circus tent on my plot. :-) ;-) (I gotta learn some new smileys) :-(

I reckon we need taxes. Have a tax-free threshold and then beyond that
threshold all savings (and/or all earnings) are taxed regularly. That way
the hoarders lose their currency while those who are actively involved
aren't heavily penalized.

Another encouragement to be actively involved would be to have free
transactions regularly (eg: For each active Player, each week the bank
will waive one PO for up to 2 VTs and one PO for 1 P-Note if that PO was
made within the preceding week). I don't know if this should extend to all
entities.

Lastly, how about giving Players more means to 'waste' their Currencies.
1. Gambling works very well here in Australia :o)
We currently have (in a nation of under 20 million individuals) four $1
000 000+ Lotto games each week, and Keno, slot machines, etc.
2. Education is another option.
What if Players could spend regularly on 'Subjects' in the 'Agora
University' to complete 'Diplomas' etc on Nomic subjects ?  It would take
time (Only 1 subject allowed per week) and Currency but would not require
the effort needed for the Patent Titles of Degrees, and would be Titles
not Patent Titles.
3. The Arts.
Agorans could patronize the arts. Either ey could create works of art ("I
erect a huge statue of a dangling carrot in front of the Welcoming
Centre") which could be appreciated by visitors to eir Location or Plot.
Or ey could sponsor the Arts in whatever manner was eventually deemed fit.
("The library is falling into disrepair as only 3 VTs have been donated
within the last 3 months.")
4. Hobbies.
Every person is willing to spend Currency on eir hobby. I have already
considered creating a collectibles hobby (like trading cards) for Agora.
Imagine speeding around the Agoran Kart track (Plot 02,36) with the wind
in your hair. Feels great doesn't it. Only costs 1 VT per lap, or for 50
VT you can buy your own kart (upkeep 2 VT weekly, track use 1 VT each
week, etc).
5. Charities.
Please give to Jester's "Agoran travelling circus" Appeal. All donations
over 3 VT are tax deductible (see above).

Let me know what you think.

The current fad for repealing white elephants makes it tempting.
However, a contributary reason for my deregistration was the Rule (I
forget the number), authored by the General, that attempts to enforce
inter-Player agreements.  Quite apart from the excessively Pragmatic
method of operation, it seems like a fundamentally bad idea to bring under
the game's control agreements that may have nothing to do with the game.
I definitely won't reregister while such a Rule is in effect.

I'm afraid it might not be.  For instance, the Promotor might add a comment
with potentially legal consequences and *not* mark it as informational
only.

You might also argue that a proposal which does not fulfill the formal
requirements of the ROM is not really an ROM proposal, but a proposal
proposed by the promotor personally, and illegally declared as an ROM
proposal. That's the interpretation I'd prefer.

I reckon we need taxes.
<<

I agree that taxes might be a good idea. And they have been discussed
before, but I guess it is hard to implement them without lots of
additional paperwork. I'll support you if you want to do things in
that direction, though.

I haven't been following the plots debates - is there a tax element in
there? If there isn't, introducing one might be a good way to curb
inflation. 

>>
Lastly, how about giving Players more means to 'waste' their Currencies.
<<

I don't think many players would use these structures. I probably
wouldn't, and I wouldn't like to have to do administrational work on
them, either. 

I have the impression that Agorans are mostly interrested in the
nomicking essentials of fiddling with rules, scamming, politicking
etc, but not so much with the "MUD"ding fun stuff that some other
nomics seem to indulge in (wigs, works of art, portraits, widgets and
what have you).

I agree that the plots stuff is also going in this direction (which is
why I don't support it) - I wonder whether it will work, and be used
by players in more ways than the absolute minimum needed to survive.

BTW, don't be afraid of the politicking part of things, it's more fun
and less nasty than you think. My experience so far was that players
mostly treat different proposals and ideas on a case by case basis, so
there may be coalitions forming to push or stop certain projects and
scams, but people seem to be quite willing to enter shifting and
changing coalitions, and to cooperate reliably with players they have
just opposed on other issues. What matters is whether you like the
idea/scam etc, but personal vendettas and longlived feuds between
players or groups are rare (if people get the impression that such
vendettas are going on against them, they tend to Leave In A Huff, I'm
afraid, even if their impression is not realistic). And lies are
explicitly prohibited, in the public forum at least.

On the other hand, the conflicts around controversial issues, scams
etc are the things I enjoy most about Agora, although recently I have
tended to be on the losing side (P-note abolition in P3585, I think
it was; the zombie scam...)

I think I would agree with your preferred interpretation for the current rule
and your proposed revision, with the additional comment that the real ROM
proposal would have been submitted but not distributed, so the Promotor would
also become guilty of an ASAP violation one week after the selection process. 
If, however, you allow any comments to be added (as in my suggestion), it would
be possible for the Promotor to add extraneous legal effects to a legal ROM
proposal without violating any Rules.

There are two ways to prevent this (if you want to):

  1.  Explicitly restrict the content of the comments (as in your proposed
      version).

  2.  Restrict the legal effects to the non-commented, fixed form portion
      of the proposal.

The first way prevents the Promotor from adding useful and/or interesting
free-form comments to the proposal unless e violates the Rules.  The second way
gives the Promotor greater flexibility without increasing eir power in using
the ROM.  As current Promotor, I would like the greater flexibility, but I'll
support your proposal in either form.

Rule Agency

The question of whether Rules have agency is, of course, a matter of the
definition of "agency".  Clearly the Rules do not have the kind of agency
associated with volition, the kind that Players have.  However, they also
clearly do have the kind of agency that a computer program has.  The real issue
seems to me to be whether "computational" agency has legal significance.  My
impression is that this issue is obscurred by the metaphorical use of
"volitional" agency in the text of Rules (or in our discussion of the
interpretation of such a Rule) that seek to initiate a computational event.

Example rule:
  "At the beginning of the Nomic Quarter, 100 P-Notes are created in the Bank."

When we say that this Rule creates 100 P-Notes at the beggining of a quarter,
it sounds like we are attributing volitional agency to the Rule, but in fact
this is just shorthand for saying that this Rule causes Players to re-compute
the game state at the beginning of the quarter by adding an additional 100
P-Notes to the Bank's P-Note holdings.

I do not think it is valid to say that computational agency is without legal
significance simply because it is not truly volitional agency.  I also think
too many Players and potential registrants are too used to the validity of
computational agency to deprive it of legal significance as a meta-game
principle rather than by specific legislation.  I suspect, also, that there is
a great deal of game custom within Agora to support its legality, so I would
say that the above example would have its intended effect in Agora.

I wonder if it might be useful to frame this debate in terms of actions rather
than agency.  I see two kinds of Player actions in this game, let me call them
"actions" and "meta-actions".  "Actions" are those things Players do that are
direct moves within the game - sending messages and performing tasks
specifically directed of them by the Rules.  "Meta-actions" are all the other
things that Players do in support of the game.  The most significant
meta-action, and the one I want to focus on in this debate, is the calculation
of the game state.  Looked at this way, the issue can be framed in terms of
whether legitimate changes to the game state can only be introduced by
"actions" or whether they can also be introduced by "meta-actions", e.g. by the
process of game state calculation.  Rules of the kind in my example force the
change to be introduced through the calculation process itself (meta-action). 
Scott's viewpoint would restrict the introduction of game state changes to
actions, as opposed to meta-actions.  I am sympathetic to Scott's idea that
this greatly reduces the chances of game state indeterminacy. I also think that
rules of the other sort do not necessarily increase the chances of
indeterminacy, but that you have to be much more careful when you write them.

In any case, if we are to go down the road of restricting all changes to Player
actions, I think we need to do it explicitly and I don't think that this is
currently the case.

We've had taxes in the past; mostly they make for busywork for the
Recordkeepor.  They don't appear to have much effect on hoarding,
unless there are ways to shelter funds, in which case everyone will
shelter their funds, rendering the tax futile.

In any case, there is no reason for the Bank to tax because it doesn't
need the stream of revenue; it can merely create new units of Currency
at will.  I would rather see a closed-system econony, with the
creation of new units of Bank Currency heavily restricted; then if we
do use a tax, it will because the Bank needs it to raise revenue,
rather than as monetary policy.  (I'd rather see the Bank manage
monetary policy [inflation] through loans and the interest rate.)

I am dubious of the merits of such Proposals.  Agorans are not prone
to wasting anything, except time.

Extremely unlikely to work.  Agorans, as a rule, will not participate
in negative-sum games, and are generally intelligent enough to
recognize negative-sum games as such.  Of course, positive-sum games
are inflationary, and zero-sum games merely redistributive.  Gambling
is only profitable for the operator when it's negative-sum.  And if I
want the thrill of gambling, I'll go down to Evansville and spend a
night at Casino Aztar.

Kieron> 2. Education is another option.  What if Players could spend

I personally will not approve any system which awards titles of
educational merit without comparable demonstration of worth.  The
Degrees require at least a token demonstration of worth.  Frankly, I
think calling this suggestion "education" somewhat insulting.

Kieron> 3. The Arts.  Agorans could patronize the arts. Either ey

I can do this without any support for it in the Rules, by virtue of
Rule 116, and without expending any Currency.  Why pay for what you
can do for free?

Kieron> 4. Hobbies.  Every person is willing to spend Currency on eir

I just imagined what you suggested without paying anybody any VTs.
Unfortunately, you can't offer anything more than that instance of
imagination.  Again, why pay for what you can have for free?

Kieron> 5. Charities.  Please give to Jester's "Agoran travelling

This will, of course, create a profligacy of "charities", and thereby
allow everyone to totally evade all taxation.

This is going to be very weird for me. I have used the handle "Jester"
for many years now, except in a couple of places, including Agora. 
It's quite strange getting messages that appear to be signed by myself.

Not at present. It could always be added.

I really don't see the sort of "frivolous" sort of thing you mention as
being something you could really accuse Plots of -- Plots is not at all
MUDdish -- it's *getting rid of* all the MUD that Agoraverse dragged in.
Despite the humorous names, Plots is at heart a number-crunching system.

On the other hand, the objection that players might not actually use it
might have some weight to it. However, I think that, even if most Players
never actually trade their commodities, it should still produce some more
economic activity, with Currency imbalances between players leading to trade.
