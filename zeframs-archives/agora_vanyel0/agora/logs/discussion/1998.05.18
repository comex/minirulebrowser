Ahem!  That "nursery rhyme" was the first verse of the Norwegian national
anthem.  Yesterday was our national day.

I keep forgetting what a bunch of crap the majordomo documentation is.

There is a file list-owner-info which should be sent to all new list
owners and which contains all you need to know.  However, if you did not
get it and/or didn't save it, then there is no way to find it in the man
pages - I only found it because I looked through the source directories.

> Did the messages get mangled? They looked OK to me...

Well, if you consider it OK that they all appeared to come from you rather
than from Crito, that they had a subject like "Bounce:  Approval
requested", that the real headers were included only in the body and that
the MIME parts therefore didn't get decoded, yes, they were OK.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Three cheers for Norway, mother country of Latin-speaking, techno-
wizard, and only-just-occasionally-irascible mathematicians! May your
nation thrive beneath the midnight sun. (At least, those parts of
it that are above the Arctic Circle.)

But you didn't answer my question: what does it mean?

I have that file, and I consulted it this morning in the course of
refreshing my memory of how to bounce messages properly; but as I
said, there wasn't time for that yesterday.

Like I said, they were OK. :) The subject line alerted readers that
the messages were not really from me as they appeared to be, and the
important parts of the messages were intact, if encapsulated in some
MIME garbage, and the extra headers. My main concern was that people
get them. The alternative was waiting until this morning to do it
your way,

But, evidently, not so embarassing as to refrain from quoting it in your
.sig :)

<sniff> That's beautiful.

And, measure for measure, here's the first verse of Australia's
national embarassment:

Australians all
let us rejoice
for we are young and free
we've golden soil
and wealth for toil -
our home is girt by sea.
Our land abounds
in nature's gifts
of beauty rich and rare
In history's page
let every stage
Adavnce Australia Fair.
In joyful strains
then let us sing
Advance Australia Fair.

>wrong?

Messages from you have had some trouble getting through.
Are you sending from a completely different address to the
one you're subscribed from? I have you subscribed at 
<dalbertz@mrb.state.ma.us>. I have turned on the 'mungedomain'
option, so messages from rmv.state.ma.us should get through
now.

Hopefully the problem is now fixed. Please try sending some
mail to the lists and see if you receive it.

In view of there being even fewer P-Notes in circulation that we
thought, the price for that Indulgence is hereby lowered to 2
P-Notes.
