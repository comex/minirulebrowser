But IN does not have that power: Each nomic is sovereign except where it
has explicitly given up control within its own rules.

It may be considered a flaw of the Internomic Rules that they don't
require a member nomic to have rules that force it to either obey the
Internomic Rules, or leave within a reasonable time.

For the moment Internomic is in this respect similar to a nomic with human
Players: It sometimes makes requirements which it has no power to enforce,
and relies on the Player's willingness to follow the Rules.

In the history of Agora the idea was once put forward that a Player which
broke a Rule would thereby implicitly stop being a Player, but that was
rejected and has not become custom. I doubt Internomic will be different;
however, since the matter has not come up before this is still to be
decided.

The Liaison of the nomic must tell Internomic that the nomic is leaving.

I once made an Internomic SFJ, submitted by Agora, which was judged false,
thereby deciding that a Liaison's actions on behalf of eir nomic are
effective, even if they are illegal according to the nomic e represents. 
So in some sense, that is all that has to happen. Of course, a Liaison
would normally follow the rules of eir nomic, one would hope.

I don't know what Ackanomic's procedures are for when the Liaison may tell
Internomic that Acka leaves.

Under Agora's current Rules, Internomic must first be declared no longer
Friendly, which the Ambassador/Liaison can do.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I would think that would be part of rule 101... but that brings up a good
point that you could just not follow that rule and continue like nothing
happened.  That would definitely bring about someone proposing new rules
about sanctions and so forth.

Yeah... and there's nothing currently written in the IN rules explaining
what happens to a member nomic which doesn't follow the rules, from what I
understand.

I think the next step is to find out what AckaNomic's rules are regarding
the IN and the Liason, and to find out if the liason is in this "vulture"
group that took over.

Do you happen to know where the IN homepage is?  (if there is one)  I've
looked for a bit, and can't seem to find it.  Also, what's the IN mailing
list?  I'd like to get on that, too.

Erick

One should hope so; it's not like too much happens in Internomic usually.

Right. It started with a bare bones ruleset and hasn't been developing
very fast.

The Liaison of Ackanomic (who is the same as the Internomic Moderator and
homepage owner) is Malenkai. According to Uri Bruck, Malenkai is a member
of the Tyranny.

IN homepage: <http://www.itw.com/~malenkai/zhome.htm>

Mailing list: internomic@muppetlabs.com
(By the way, the list address has recently changed.)

To subscribe, send a message to majordomo@muppetlabs.com with a body of
"subscribe internomic".

Greetings,

This may seem like a very odd request, but if anyone has copies, I'd appreciate it if someone 
could send me copies of my most recent Cartographor's and Mad Scientist's Reports. I'm trying to 
get a new setup going so I can continue my duties here in my temporary location, but I'll need 
copies of the old reports. Thanks!
