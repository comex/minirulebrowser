Nice touch, General! :) But this gives me an idea: should we legislate
to allow the Rulekeepor (or even, any Player?) to correct spelling mistakes
in the Rules Without Objection?

Actually, if memory serves, The Threat was formed before the
Mousetrap scam, as a tongue-in-cheek response to a remark of
KoJen's. I seem to recall Jeff coming to me with the idea
for the scam, and my reaction being something like: "Great! Now we
can live up to our name."

I like the idea. Now that we have declarations of Presence, Quorum
won't be a problem. I'm not fazed by Vanyel's (?) concern that voting
might become impossible. I don't think there's a genuine risk of that.
Besides, anything that really made adopting Proposals impossible within
a 4 week period would be blocked by R1698.

However, this experiment should probably be tried separately from another
experiment I'd like to conduct: make voting public, rather than by
secret ballot. Ie, force Players to vote only in the Public Forum.
I think this might have some interesting effects, and I'd like to see
what they are. Not that there would be anything particularly difficult
about doing both things at once (VTs must become a lot scarcer than
they are now in any event), but your experiment will, I think, be
more interesting if Players don't have to reveal how they're voting.
Hmmm, maybe we shold try it both ways.

It doesn't really matter whether the Bank can go negative or not.
All you need to do is define the concept of the number of VTs
'in circulation' (ie, not held by the Bank), and limit that to 5*P.

There isn't really a non-voting penalty as such in the Rules right
now, not at least in the sense of extra transfers which have to be
recorded. (Is that the sense you intended?) R1699 has already been
repealed. The situation at present is that voters get the stipend and
non-voters don't. Personally, I quite like the system at present;
after much tweaking, it's pretty close to what I wanted. VTs entering
circulation due to the stipend roughly balance VTs leaving circulation
due to voting. The major source of VTs entering and not leaving
circulation at the moment is Salaries. I have some ideas about how to
deal with those. These are not inconsistent with Kolja's: if VTs were
very scarce indeed, Officers would probably be more inclined to spend
their Salaries on voting.

Procmail is acting up again and it doesn't look as if I'm receiving any mail.
I'm working on the problem.

And where are the Indulgences going to come from to achieve this?  I
am not going to vote for something that causes the system that Oerjan
so carefully set up (a sum total of -1 etc) to be messed around with.
I suppose a reading might be that the Indulgences come from the
Bank...

As you're probably well aware, this will change very little for some
Voters, such as me, who habitually Vote publicly anyway. As I recall,
I adopted this policy for two principal reasons : first, to avoid any
difficulties with possible mail transport problems between me and
the Assessor; second, and most important, that in a context where
most Players Vote secretly, disclosing your own Vote could have some
influence on other Players' Votes - without needing any expenditure
in bribes or other forms of enticement. That was the theory, anyway;
it's been borne out in some cases at least.

IMHO prohibiting secret ballots will lessen this influence, such as it
was; on the other hand, it should encourage livelier debate _during_
the Voting Period on Proposals, which I think will be much more enjoyable
overall.

I would support such a possibility, perhaps officially limiting such
changes to cosmetic ones in the sense of Rule 1668. As it is the
Rulekeepor's job to define changes as cosmetic or not, such changes
should always go through eir hands, even if suggested by other
players; maybe there could also be a small reward for successful
corrections of this type?

I like that idea, especially as I find it hard to predict what kind of
voting behavior this would encourage. (Do you have any predictions for
the influence of public voting? I think it might be fun to compare
everyone's expectations with what will actually happen when votes are
public). So I would support a proposal along the lines of what you
posted shortly after the quoted suggestion.

However, I do think it should be separated from the change to very
scarce VTs, because with very few VTs around (and especially when
everyone is still adapting to the shock of a sharp reduction in the VT
circulation) I think it is quite obvious what everyone would do:
Withhold eir votes until the last moment, waiting to see whether the
others vote the way e wants to anyway, and paying VTs to vote FOR or
AGAINST instead of just being present only if things seem to go
"wrong".

Apart from being boring this would also introduce a lot of asymmetry
between players because of timing problems: voting at the last moment
is easier for those whose working (or online ;) hours happen to be
close to the ending of the voting period, and there would be the
danger/hassle/paperwork of mails just arriving too late to count
etc. (of course that might provide a nice check of the rules
concerning timing, time stamps of mails etc :)

Dear Blob,

What do you think about the following scenario: Some player is
desperate to get rid of eir blots, and for that purpose only tries a
revolution every week, even against the odds, until e finally
succeeds. Have you got an idea how likely that would be to succeed (or
fail because the "agitator" becomes lawless and is deregistered
according to Rule 1714), given the odds for a single revolution to
succeed and the additional blots that come with failure?

Do you think that would be an _abuse_ of the rule, or do you _want_
that to be possible? I think it might be a good move for a player with
several blots, but a bit boring (and repetitive) for the others.

Also I notice that together with your other proposal to let office
holders stay in power indefinitly this would mean a transition from a
democratic re-election system to an African style coup-driven system
where officers hold on to power until they are explicitly kicked out
(pardon the macabre real world example, this may be fun in a Nomic,
but it certainly isn't in central Africa).

I think I would prefer to keep things more democratic and less
"African", to be honest.

I, personally, don't like the idea of public voting - it seems to 
generate too many complications. I also think that we should get our 
pay-as-you-vote system in good order before we modify voting in other 
ways.

There's been much discussion both ways with no real consensus
emerging, but no CFJ.

With 20 players, that's a 5% chance of success per week, meaning about a
50% chance of success within 14 attempts.  How many Blots would the
proto have the Rebels lose upon each failed attempt?  If it's at least 2,
then anyone with "several" blots would have perhaps a 1/3 chance of
getting rid of eir Blots that way.

A Rebellion doesn't kick any Officers out of Office, merely forces
em to win another Election.  And the indefinite-power idea wouldn't
apply to all Officers, just those who tend to get re-Elected anyway;
so a Rebellion would likely have little substantive effect on those
Offices.

No problem:

Rule 1435 says in part: "a loss of Blots is the same as a gain of  
Indulgences." and Rule 1479 says, in part:

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to receive some quantity of
      Currency but does not specify where the Currency shall be
      transferred from, that quantity shall be transferred from the
      Bank to that Player's Treasury.

So the Indulgences are transferred from the bank.

This is why I changed the old "Blots are set to zero" to "lose all their
Blots."

So the -1 sum is never lost, altho the Bank's holding could potentially
go negative, for a time, until sufficient Blots are gained by Players.

Lets see. There are 18 players, so a one-man revolution has a 1 in 18
chance of success. You gain 3 Blots per failed revolt (if you issue the
CFR), and can only revolt once per week. You also gain 1 Blot per week
for Debt.

Thus, you have ceiling(30/4) = 8 chances to revolt before becoming 
Lawless.

So you have:

1/18 + 1/18 * 17/18 + 1/18 * (17/18)^2 + ... + 1/18 * (17/18)^7
~= 1/3, chance.

A bit high maybe. I would if anyone would be willing to take the risk?

Not really. A Rebellion could be the act of a righteous few fighting 
against their oppressors, or of a lawless few seeking to take control. :)

With a maximum of one per week, I don't see it as a much of a nuisance.

There are mechanisms to overcome this. Firstly, the appointment is Without
Objection, so if any single player objects to it, the appointment has no
effect.

Secondly, you can always Rebel, or impeach the Speaker.

Democratic elections are not interesting if you do not give any real
powers to the people you elect. Otherwise, why choose one candidate over
the other?

Same here. Of course, I've only been using it for one week.
(Okay, I lost two messages while trying to get it set up, plus a 
bunch of test messages, but those don't count.)

I think you're probably right about the tendency to produce the race
condition - but I think it would only be a tendency. I've noticed
that Players rarely play 'hard', or optimally. Which I think is a
shame, but it's still a fact. How much this tendency would actually
be expressed is one of the interesting things I wish to observe. At
any rate, I disagree that it would be boring, especially given the
limited trial period being proposed.

I think you might have failed to notice the possibility of a
countertendency to vote early on some Proposals as a strategic means
of creating a bandwagon effect. Ie, you and maybe 3 other Players all
vote FOR early in the VP, and by doing so, you discourage others from
voting AGAINST, since you make it look as though such a vote will be
wasted. Would such tactics actually be used? That's another thing I'd
like to observe.

I rather hope, although I don't know that I'd go so far as to say that
I expect, that the Public Voting Experiment might encourage more
debating about voting, (ie more posts along the lines of "Why did you
vote *that* way?") and more attempts to persuade Players to change
their votes, whether that is achieved by the use of reason or by the
use of bribes.
