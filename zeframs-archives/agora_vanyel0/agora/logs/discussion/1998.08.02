As far as I can see, no one is suggesting such a thing - the nearest
thing I believe could prompt your reaction is Gen. Chaos' claim that
your assessment of game custom in this case is mistaken, and I don't
think you should take that as an insult; the Court of Appeals exists
precisely for the reason that Player may sometimes feel that a
Judge's reasoning is flawed, or eir understanding of the facts in
error.

My call for an appeal of your Judgement had absolutely nothing to do with
the quality of the job you did.  As I stated in my appeal, this Judgement
will have serious repercussions.  In addition, the reasoning behind your
Judgement is in conflict with the Judgements of past Judges, in particular
CFJs 1094(in which Judge Steve ruled that Private Orders sent by Swann to
the Public Forum were, in fact, valid) and 1097 (in which Judge Kolja A.
ruled that a Private Order I posted to the Public Forum was, in fact,
issued).  For these reasons (and others as well) I felt that a further
review by the Board of Appeals was warranted.

Also, as someone who took the time to assist you in reaching a Judgement, I
personally take offense at the very idea that I have been anything but
supportive of your efforts as a Judge.  In the future I will perhaps not be
so willing to assist.

It should also be noted that the language I used is essentially the
same as that used in briefs filed in the appellate courts of the
United States.  I certainly intended no opprobrium by it.

dfw.net seems to be having a few problems, so I'm sending out

Apologies if it appears twice.

I confused that with 1100... Hey, what's the deal with assigning
CFJ numbers in binary, anyway ? ;)

I am glad to hear that.  I never said that the order was not conveyed
to Swann, just that it was not conveyed directly to Swann  as the rules
state need to take place.  I also did not rule that the orders were
invalid, just that they were not executed, since they did not meet the
qualification of execution as per the rule.

Indeed, a decision on that will be made shortly.

Is there any way an unexecuted Order can be valid given that Rule 1793
defines say that "an Order is a command, executed by a Player..."?  It seems
to me that execution is a condition of existence.  Have I missed something?

> I hereby nominate for Clerk of the Courts.

Hmm, BTW, is this in fact legal ? 

Rule 1558/2 (Power=1)

      [...]

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted
        Nomination, would not be permitted to hold the Office which
        the Election is seeking to fill.

Rule 1450/2 (Power=1)
Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

If you take "hold the Office" as "hold in the normal fashion",
which is a not unreasonable assumption, the legality of a Speaker
Nominating for CotC or Justiciar is questionable.

I may be wrong, but I think what lee was trying to say was that his
Judgement does not contradict outright previous Judgements finding that
certain orders were validly issued, since those Judgements did not
address the question (of the meaning of the word 'directly' in R1808)
which he addresses in his. lee may be saying that it his view that had
the Orders been conveyed directly to Swann, in his sense of that word,
they would have been, or may well have been, valid.

Curses, you're absolutely right. I can't nominate for CotC, unless
I first give up the Speakership. Oh well.

I wish I had thought of that. :)

Let me just add that, while I hope the Judgement is overturned because of
the mess it might cause, I can only look to Game Custom for grounds to do
so.  Lee was quite correct in putting the actual wording of the Rule ahead
of the way Game Custom has led us to interpret it.  My main reasoning for
the Appeal was simply that a fuller consideration of the ramifications is
warranted and the Appeal Board seemed the best way to start.

I know how you feel Lee, I seem to recall that one Judgement I returned was
referred to as "the most appealed CFJ in Agoran history!"  :)

I understand that, but my point is all Private Orders not sent directly to
the Player being Ordered are invalidly executed, correct?  If so someone
better be ready for another Order Coup because all those Coup d'etat Orders
were never executed.

But how is that different from the case discussed in CFJ 737? (Does
anyone have the text of this CFJ, btw? My records don't go back that
far, and the CFj is missing from the Agora Archives.) Several Heralds
(or at least one Herald for a period of months) followed the practice of
accepting Kudo transfers before the problem with R1062 was noticed.

I think it's premature to be claiming that reassigning the CFJs will
result in a 'mess of unprecedented extent'. Around here, that's a big
claim. I don't think we know enough at the moment to be able to say just
how much of a mess reassigning the CFJs would be. We don't know how many
CFJs would be affected, or which ones they are. But it strikes me as
implausible that this mess could be worse, or even as bad, as the mess
that followed the discovery that 'Pragmatic Currencies' had not really
passed, about 2 months after we thought that it had. At any rate, what
we really ought to be doing is trying to discover which CFJs are
affected.

But would anyone try it now? All the gloss has been taken off it.

Are all aspects of the 'game' subject to change by proposal-and-vote?

I think you must have missed the second 'only' in R1859:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
      votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on
      Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by sending
      a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal, Election, or
      Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted to send or copy
                 ^^^^
      such messages to themselves.)

So the last sentence is not redundant.

An unexecuted command still exists, but, by virtue of not having been
executed, lacks the legal status of an Order.

I had given it some thought.  Of course, that's really just the least of the
problems that will result if in fact most of the Private Orders haven't been
executed.  It will be a record keeping nightmare to say the least.

It certainly would be a stiff test of the Order paradigm. One would hope
that the result would be a lot of reversing Orders correcting, in the
present, mistakes made in the past. But is that what would actually
happen? I'm not sure...

I predict that a number of Players will find themselves with debts they
cannot pay as a result of this.

Which is neither here nor there. It would have a number of effects, none
of them especially undesirable in themselves. First, it would massively
increase the demand for Indulgences. It would also increase the supply
of Indulgences, since an Indulgence Lottery would have to be held the
week after all the Blots were issued. Second, it would greatly increase
the chances of a Revolt, since successful Rebels get a Blot amnesty.
Third, it would increase the influence of the CotC, who has the power to
pardon Lawless Players. Interesting, no?

Obviously, the proto represents a significant change in our practices.
Nevertheless, it is borne out of a clear-eyed assessment of our current
circumstances. We have, after years of trying, achieved a balanced
economy in all three of our major commodities, and in VTs in particular.
But the size of that economy is very small - in the region of 8 VTs per
week are being spent. I think there is broad agreement that an increase
in the absolute size of the economy is desirable. My recent attempts in
this direction have not been markedly successful (although the results
of the experiments have certainly provided us with interesting
information). The effect of banning Presence has not been to increase VT
expenditure as I hoped, but rather to redistribute it so that it gets
spent on fewer Proposals. There doesn't seem to be much support for
continuing with Secret Voting, and there seems to be a positive yearning
for the reintroduction of Presence. Since these did not work out
especially well, I'm content for that to happen.

But what does that leave us with? The various 'encouragements' to vote
have not really worked. So it seems to me worth trying something
stronger: a requirement to vote. Asking Players who can afford it to
spend 1 VT a week is not a lot to ask in my opinion, and the potential
benefits are significant.

Would you be prepared to support a 2 month trial?

By the way, the proto as it stands has a significant problem: it
re-opens in a new form the familiar loophole that allows Players to
avoid some requirement which is contingent on their having certain
assets by setting up dummy Contestsa (or using Group treasuries) to
serve as holding companies for those assets (cf Chuck's Savings and Loan
Contest). Any ideas as to how to close this loophole off?

I concede that this is a cost of the proposal, but I think it's worth
paying.

Introduce the notion of a Player's net worth ?
