The easiest fix is not to allow TOs to be vacated at all.  This is
what I think is best.  I'm not quite sure what the difference betwen
TOs and POs is such that one should be able to be vacated and the
other not, but I feel it exists.

I agree, and I'll take a stab at stating the difference.  TOs
are, in one sense (and purely an extra-legal one), satisfied
immediately.  Yes, they do impose a requirement on the recordkeepor,
but in fact when Bob posts a transfer to me, as long as the
transfer is valid (Bob has enough of the given currency), I
have those currencies available for immediate use.  I can
in fact spend those currencies before Bob's TO is de jure satisfied
by being recorded by the recordkeepor.

If we thus think of TOs as being satisfied immediately, then
not allowing them to be vacated falls in line with the "satisfied
Orders cannot be vacated, or (same thing) vacation of a satisfied
Order has no effect."

POs, of course, are not immediately satisfied, so can be vacated
(with effect).

You are correct.  I sent them "hurry up" messages over the weekend
giving them a little extra time.  But they haven't judged yet, so I
will be appointing new Judges presently.

I agree that a BOS of 0.5 VTs is appropriate at the moment. In fact,
before this flexible tool of a variable BOS was introduced, I was
thinking of cutting the BOS in half by a simple rule change as a
remedy for the current inflation.

Of course, if we reintroduce unemployment benefit, this will mean that
people (like me) who hold a single office with a salary of 1 BOS do
not receive any reward for their work. Now in my case that's not too
bad really, because I am certainly not overworking myself as
ambassador. But with plots half introduced now I, for one, would
prefer to make plots functional soon, and give non-officers a way to
earn real money. Unemployment benefits are, IMHO, just a makeshift
tool to keep non-officers alive until plots are running.

I'm afraid I do not see this as a fix at all, as I'll elucidate below.

Since the Rules permit all Players to issue Private Orders, this is no
restriction at all.

I'm still waiting to see what circumstances would *prevent* the execution of a
Private Order.  So far, only orders that seek to compel a Player to break the
Rules would be invalid.

Same thing.  The Rules to not explicitly render any Order invalid, unless it
would force a Player to break the Rules.

What is the personal business of the Player issuing them?  Certainly gaining
wealth and Kudos, getting your proposals moved up in the queue and getting them
passed are all direcly relevant.  I don't think this restriction works to
prevent people from ordering transfers, votes, or other actions that we would
normally consider improper.

Actually, I fail to see the need for any Private Orders that are not explicitly
defined by the Rules.  If you want to enforce private agreements, add penalty
clauses to the agreement or define standard penalties for broken agreements,
both of which can be enforced by the courts.

Re: DIS: Re: BUS: PROTO: Order Fix, Final

Take a look at the queue.  I already have a proposal there which would prevent
TO's from being vacated.  If you like it, it might save you the trouble of
working up another one.

A couple of remarks. You seem to have forgotten that unemployment
benefits are expressed in terms of the BOS: they are half the BOS
to be precise. So Officers will always have a relative VT-income
advantage with respect to the unemployed, which is probably as it
should be.

Secondly, I think we should regard the necessity of halving the BOS
as an indication that Officers are currently overpaid.

I don't think that's true. When we had unemployment benefits, they were
defined in terms of the BOS. If we reinstated them that was as 1/2 the
BOS, the unemployed would get either 0.2 or 0.3 VTs a week, rather than
the 0.5 VTs of a low-paid officer.

"Request" implies that the request could be refused.  I think I prefer
"Transfer Notice".
