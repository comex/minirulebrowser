I suppose so.

It needs a clause along the lines of "Upon such a Win, all the Winner's
Plots become Owned by the Bank".  Would you support it then?

What's so tough about making 4 Payment Orders each time a new Player
registers?  I have the Registrar do it because that's who tracks
registrations and Grace Periods.

Sounds good.

Right.

No, it's because I added Movement to the Degree system by making "granted"
and "awarded" non-synonymous; so I'm taking it out by making them
synonymous.  It could also be done by replacing all instances of one with
the other, but why not allow either term to be used?

I hadn't even noticed that such a clause was absent. :-/

No no no no. I mean, the Registrar would get rather poor, having to 
pay each new player all that...

I'm afraid you've lost me completely. What does Movement have to do 
with Degrees? I'm sure it's very simple, but I'm confused.

 Hello guys,

 I'm running a Nomic game via my E-mail gaming zine (game & discussion 
 newsletter) "The Bluesmobile" and was wondering if and how contact can be
 established between the various E-mailable 'Nomic planets' (about 20 in 
 number, as far as I'm aware). All and any reactions to this are very 
 welcome.


 All the best,

 Berry Renken

We are, to an extent, way ahead of you there, Berry. Several email
Nomics (Agora, Thring, Acknomic, Rishonomic, The Pumpkin Patch) are
already in steady contact with each other and are indeed conducting a
game of Internomic with the individual Nomics as members. It's good
to see that there are other Nomics out there, though. It'd be great
to swell the Internomic membership and get more Nomic Players in touch
with each other.

The Agora Mailing Lists are located at:

<agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>
<agora-official@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>
<agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>

I'll get the Internomic mailing list address for you in a tic and pass
it along. No, better, I'll cc this to Agora and to Internomic. Someone
will get in touch with you. Probably several people.

We had a brief spate of people saying that they were reading this.  

I'm wondering what people thought about it.  I haven't read it myself,
so I want to know if it's worth my time (it'd go to the end of a very
long queue :-)

Tangentially yours,
Michael.

I don't like the 'without being required to do so by the Rules (including
by a Payment Order)' part. What about '... without being required to do
so by the Rules, and without satisfying a Payment Order by the Transfer.'

'... whether any given Voting Entity has voted or declared Presence' can
be interpreted in the wrong way. I think it is therefore better to change
the phrase into "... as long as e does not indicate of any given Voting
Entity specifically whether the Voting Entity has voted or declared
Presence."

Those last two words are a cut-and-paste-error, I presume?

No, no, no, no. Paying out doesn't make one any poorer:

Rule 1479/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill"

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some quantity of
      Currency to some entity, that Player shall execute a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that entity for the amount specified.

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill an entity for some
      quantity of Currency, that Player shall execute a Payment Order
      from that entity to the Bank for the amount specified.

Well said.  And if the Rulekeepor were entitled to "reinterpret"
Rule Changes in this way, I'm not sure I would want to be Rulekeepor.

I like all these Protos, and it is especially good that we finally get
some timeout clauses. More comments on that below.

Drop that "presumed" - this are the actual results.  And why not extend
this to Referenda and Proposals as well (although probably with a longer
timeout for Proposals)? Ancient errors in the Rules have caused a lot of
grievance before.

I had an idea myself that we should have a timeout on reporting
Infractions, as well - somewhere between one and two months, I think.

This makes me think - what if the Chancellor forgets? There should a
timeout for basic requirements as well. Let's be comprehensive.

And to plug the final hole, a 6 month timeout on _absolutely all_ errors.
This one seems harder to phrase, however.

All good.

This is a patch for the particular question of election results. Could
we not use the more generic instrument of report ratification?
E.g. making the ratification of the first registrar's report after an
election obligatory?

The main reason for having an exception is
to remind people whether they have Voted, and publishing just a count
would not do that.
<<

Of course, the publication of this information also serves to show
whether quorum has already been satisfied. For example, I published a
voting reminder for INP 350 because at that time quorum was not met
then. 

The decision to publish or not publish such a reminder, of course,
gives me some influence over the outcome if quorum has not been met
yet. This kind of influence of the vote collector may be desirable or
not.

This would eliminate the above possibility of influencing the outcome
slightly, and make the list of possible decisions (2xFOR, FOR,
PRESENT, no vote, AGAINST, 2xAGAINST) even more symmetric.

To me it would seem more interesting to abolish the cost free
declaration of presence - that would increase the pressure on decision
making processes due to scarce VT supply.

This is an automatic cancellation, right? I do think it works, and
have nothing special against it, but somehow I feel this goes against
the PC paradigm where all status changes of POs and TOs are made by

Wouldn't that encourage laziness and a general spirit of laissez
faire? "I'll just do what comes to my mind - if I'm called on it, I
can always read the rules later and claim to have been unaware of the
details". 

Of course it it annoying to be penalized for things you weren't aware
of (or, even worse, for things you _were_ aware of but couldn't
change, anyway, like my recent failure-to-report penalty, had it
survived in court), but I think falling into unexpected traps can also
be considered part of the fun of playing a Nomic with a very complex
ruleset. 

It may be an inappropriate reference to real life, but I think that
ignorance should be no protection from persecution.

The Internomic Judgement was that whatever the Liaison declares is an
action of eir Nomic, whether or not it is regulated internally. There is
nothing in Agora's Rules regulating this, so you are free to do as you
please. I think your Proto is just a rewording of the current status quo.

That's the old Virus sentence - I don't remember whether it was overlooked
or whether it was Infected while the Amendment of the Virus rule was going
on.

Note that there is currently a Proposal by Andre to Amend 1633 and
completely remove the 1 INP per Week limitation (as well as the Virus.)

I would say that the Rules allow you to do anything you want with a subsequent
proposal.  It might not be a bad idea to make this explicit, as your proto
does.

This Rule was infected by a previous version of the Virus.  It never got
disinfected and so remains our Rule of lowest precedence.  8)

No.  First, there is information in the Registrar's Report which does
not pertain to Officers.  Second, Ratification is, in my opinion, an
extraordinary measure, not one that should be exercised frequently or
lightly, let alone routinely.

I would rather establish a set of "cutoff" clauses such as the one I
propose for various things; the exact cutoffs might be different for
different things, of course.

Voting is already a special case in the PC paradigm.  It is tolerable
because the Assessor is both collector of Votes and Recordkeepor of
Voting Tokens.

The general principle I'm shooting at is that one should not be
punished for not doing things you should not reasonably have been
aware you had to do.  Ignorance of the Rules is not an excuse; neither
is ignorance of something being posted to the PF.  But what about the
case where a CFJ finds that our interpretation of some Rule has been
in error for six weeks?  This could create a great many penalties for
the failure to perform various duties ASAP.  This Rule would provide
those Players with the Innocent Error defense: they reasonably
believed that they were not obliged to perform those duties.  That's
not simple ignorance; it's reasoned belief of nonapplicability.

I understand that. How are you going to draw the line between these

Hmm.  I can't find it in my inbox or archives.  I'm afraid I may have mistaken
it for a proto, since I do remember seeing it.  My apologies.  Please send me
another copy and I will distribute it immediately.

Might have something to do with the fact that Swann forgot to remove the
word "Proto" when he tried to Propose it...

I've been reading it, and enjoying it a lot. I'm about half way through
at the moment, although I seem to have set it aside in an attempt to
finish David Foster Wallace's immense _Infinite Jest_, a novel about
addiction in the Republic of Entertainment which I highly recommend.
_Le Ton Beau de Marot_ is by far Hofstadter's most personal book to
date, since it includes among many other things many reminiscences of
his late wife, and anecdotes about translating GEB into many other
languages. Well, since the book is about translation, there's lots of
stories about translating all kinds of things - Pushkin's _Eugene
Onegin_, George Perec's _La Disparition_, and so on. I've just read
an explanation of the theory of relativity using only English words of
Anglo-Saxon origin *and* of one syllable. Quite a set of hoops to jump
through!

It's a hangover from the previous version of the Virus, which had
the effect of appending that sentence to the infected Rule. There's
another one left in Rule 1645 (Temporary Delegation of Office).

Ah. I misunderstood (or rather, didn't know R1479 existed). There 
*has* to be a clearer phrase than "Pay Out" (and "Bill"), which sound 
like the funds are going to/from the person doing the 
pay-outing/billing.

Not quite. R1645 also remains infected by the old Virus - and it has
a higher number.

I bring to your attention the following sequence of events:

Date: Wed, 5 Nov 1997 15:32:34 -0500 (EST)
   Harlequin resigns as Commander-in-Chief, naming Vlad as his successor.
   Harlequin goes On Hold, and is removed form the Office of Cartographor.
   Speaker Morendil becomes temporary Cartographor.

Date: Wed, 5 Nov 1997 16:50:52 -0600 (CST)
   Vlad consents to be Commander-in-Chief.

Rule 880:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.

Question: when an Officer resigns and appoints a Player other than
the Speaker to succeed em, and the other Player consents (as is
the case here), when does the change of Office occur? At the time
of the resignation, or at the time consent is given? What if consent
is withheld?

If the change does not occur until consent is given, then Harlequin
was still CinC when he went On Hold. He would thus have been removed
from that Office when he went On Hold and the Office would have fallen
to Speaker Morendil. If that's so, does the Office go to Vlad when 
Vlad consents? That's hard to justify.

There is way to preserve the intuition that Vlad is now CinC - but
we may not like it much. That is to say that at the time Vlad consents,
he retroactively becomes CinC as of the time that Harlequin resigned.
Note that this does not violate the new R108. Maybe this is what former
Wizard Zefram was referring to when he opined that the new R108 does not
really prohibit retroactivity.

Comments?

My reading of this is that the new Player becomes temporary holder of the
Office upon specification as described in the first sentence.  The lack of
consent within seven days or public refusal then either throws the Office back
to the original Player at the time of the refusal (or at the end of seven days)
or retroactively invalidates the appointment (which effectively amounts to the
same thing).  If there is retroactivity in this Rule, it seems to me to be in
the refusal provisions, not in the appointment provision.
