Ah, now I understand our differences.  I agree with Steve--I'm
not so much interested in simulating a real economy.  I am interested
in creating a game where Players must make difficult choices about
how to use their limited resources.  Hopefully some interesting
bartering will result from that, but I don't know that it would
be particularly interesting (to me, of course) to move beyond bartering
to a monetary economy.

I think you're overly optimistic about Summary Adoption.  Consider
Plots--they were unworkable due to an unintended error.  But would
Summary Adoption have helped them?  I think not, as people who
were opposed to Plots in the first place would most likely have
Objected to the fix in order to keep Plots unworkable.

What's your point?  The reformat proposals aren't even bug fixes--they're
purely asthetic!  Nothing but a pretty ruleset and a slightly easier
way of referring to portions of Rules is lost by not having them.

No *need*, perhaps, but it's a convenient distinction.  Players
are those people who have agreed to abide by the Rules.  Thus,
it's reasonable for the Rules to impose various duties on Players.
People who have not agreed to abide by the Rules--or those who did
at one time but have revoked such agreement--are non-Players.  Since
Agora has no efective means of enforcing the Rules on those who do
not wish to obey them, there is no point in the Rules attempting
to impose requirements on non-Players.

What I was driving at is that having a child is an example of
an action not defined by the Rules as having legal significance
creating an entity that does, and so is a counterexample to your
rule.

Look at my example. We can't arbitrarily alter the sphere of
Players while it exists, unless we are willing to have
Players who completely ignore the Rules, which seems counterintuitive.
Rule 101 tells us that, among other things, Players are entities
that are willing to follow the Rules, just as Article I of
Amend. XV tells us that persons are born, they reside places, they
may have privileges or immunities, they have life, liberty, and
property, and that they can be protected by the laws. An incomplete
definition, surely, but a definition nonetheless.

Well, Summary Adoption Without Three Objections would be better,
but I'll take what I can get.

Why can't we have Players who are unwilling to follow the Rules?

You are assuming that, because a law has been passed which explicitly
or implicitly recognizes that an entity has certain properties, it has
those properties.  Does this mean that, in your opinion, until the
Thirteen Amendment was adopted, slavery was moral, and afterward it
was not?

For the same reason we can't annex Poland.

The Thirteenth Amendment is silent on the morality of slavery. If
you are asking whether the existence of a law that requires all fire
hydrants to be painted red means that all fire hydrants are, in fact,
red, then of course not. But "fire hydrant" is a concrete entity;
it exists regardless of its color. "Player" is not the same order of
concept. An equivalent dictum would be "All Catholics must believe
in the Trinity".

Well, I don't think we need an economy at all. But, if I may ask,
why did you respons with "Indeed." when I made the statement that
Monopoly is a more realistic economic simulation than we have now.
I took that as approval of my criticism.

You are aware, of course, that the United States asserts the right to
prosecute violations of a certain subset of its laws no matter where
they occur.  The reason the United States doesn't annex Poland is that 
it would be impractical to do so.  (Actually, to an extent the United
States does lack the power to do so, because the United States has
agreed to abide by the law of nations.)

Protoproposal Chaos174 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1502

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1502 be amended to read:

      The Registrar's Report shall contain at least:

      (a) The White Pages, which consist of a list of all Registered
          Players, with their Nomic nickname, preferred email address,
          current On/Off Hold status, and the date the Player last
          Registered or went On or Off Hold;

      (b) The Blue Pages, which consist of a list of all Offices and
          other official positions within Agora (such as Speaker),
          with the Nomic nickname of the holder of each position, and
          (in the case of Offices) when the last Election for that
          Office was and whether the Office is held temporarily; and

      (c) any other information required by the Rules.

Think about it a little more.  If you were categorically opposed
to all Summary Adoptions (and I make no claim about whether Steve
is so opposed or not), how would you oppose them?  I can think
of three methods off-hand (although I am sure there are more),
and one is decidedly cheaper than the other two.

Protoproposal Chaos175 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1681

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category. Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) the Rule Number;
        (2) the Rule's Amendment Number;
        (3) the Rule's Power;
        (4) the Rule's Title;
        (5) the Rule's text; and
        (6) any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) a brief description of each Category; and
        (2) any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in
          the FLR.

And what I was driving at is that if you assert that the Rules
grant legal significance to an object, then even if the Rules
do not specifically regulate it, the act of creation or destruction
of such an object *is* a legally significant action (by virtue
of the Rules) and so is not a counterexample to my Rule.

Another example.  Suppose we had a Rule which stated that
any Player living in Australia counts as two Players for the
purpose of distributing Indulgences.  Then, IMO, moving
to Australia is a legally significant action, even though the
Rules don't say anything specific about that particular action.

Well, my leaving was definitive once I had pressed that 'send' button, if
only because the rules give no way to retract a Cantus Cygneus once it has
been issued. And to be honest, I don't think I'll re-apply for membership
anytime soon. I am certain you did not mean those words that way, but it
is how I read them. And it hurt. Furthermore, as I wrote, my fun in playing
wasn't at its highest anyway.

On the other hand, even without leaving like this I might have considered
not re-applying for the job. I get a feeling that all actions I made as a
Chancellor can be split in three categories:
- Completely boring acts
- Acts that upset people
- Outright mistakes

Now, I must agree that the whole Office undoubtedly exists for #1, but still,
none of these three is what I hope to do when I'm playing Nomic.

In fact, I think that is the main problem of present-day Agora, as I also
have already written in private email with Michael: much of the game consists
of a whole lot of complicated book-keeping. This leaves less and less time for
things like drafting proposals and thinking up scams. The Currency systems are
probably the main culprit, but not the only one.

It depends on what you mean with 'staying'. I intend to keep following the
game, and probably also provide input, as a Watcher. But whether I will 
re-join as a Player? At the moment I don't feel like it. I guess that one
day I will. But that might well take as long as it did last time.

Protoproposal Chaos200 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1658

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1658 be amended to read:

      (a) A Speaker shall become Tainted when a Referendum calling for
          the Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is
          authorized to call such a Referendum at any time, by
          requesting such to the Public Forum.

      (b) This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
          Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that
          Speaker is Tainted.

      (c) For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
          modified as follows:
        (1) the Vote Collector is the Registrar;
        (2) Voting Entities do not include the Speaker; and
        (3) the minimum Adoption Ratio to pass is 2.

Protoproposal Chaos195 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1747

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1747 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

      (a) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
          eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
          and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
          Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
          Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
          possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold for
          Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X
          number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number
          of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no longer
          Lawless.

      (c) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
          may reregister.

      (d) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
          Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
          list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

      (e) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
          penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
          this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from any
          source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to another
          Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

I'd be glad to entertain suggestions for simplification.  I tend to
think that my Currencies proposal would have simplified things, but I
don't believe it got a decent consideration last time I proposed it.

I'm disappointed to see you go in part I supported your democracy

That's fine, although it's not the same as what you said earlier.
What you said is that only those actions 'defined by the rules'
can create entities with legal significance. That is an active, not a
passive, approach.

I agree that we're not there yet. But I think we're exploring interestng
conceptual territory in game design, as your idea, which is an
interesting one, illustrates.

But this is precisely the political problem that General Chaos has to
solve. Given the current state of the Rules, the General would have to
be crazy to think that his Reformatting Proposals will gather enough VT
expenditure to pass - if he proposed them one at a time, as he has been
doing. As I see things, he has chosen to solve this problem by proposing
Summary Adoption. If we wanted to attribute to the General profounder
motives, we could even speculate that his making of many dozens of these
Reformatting Proposals is a move aimed precisely at creating the
political climate in which Summary Adoption will be supported.

However, I don't like Summary Adoption one little bit, and I have no
intention of making things so easy for the General. As I have indicated
to you privately, I will Object to every Proposal which is put up for
Summary Adoption (if the Proposal passes). My purpose in doing so will
be to force the General Chaos to consider the more traditional method of
solving his political problem which is available to him. As is hinted
at above, this is to bundle all the Reformatting Proposals into just
one Proposal, akin to Ørjan's 'Spring Cleaning'. It needn't take a year
to reformat the Rules, if this is considered desirable (a question which
has not been discussed). It can be done in a week if we so choose.

Michael, I'll exchange a P-Note for 2 VTs.

On the other hand, there are plenty of options available to a Player (and
I note with sadness that this designation no longer applies to you) to
alleviate this irritating situation. You just have to make deals of
various kinds.

We did indeed.

Rule 1771/3 (Power=1)
Changing Priority

      An Player may increase or decrease the Priority of a Proposal in
      the Queue by announcing to the Public Forum that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to
      the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased
      by one as specified by the Player making the payment, provided
      that this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

I doubt I could have prevented it from coming to a vote. As Promotor,
General Chaos has powers and privileges with respect to the Proposal
Queue that would be difficult if not impossible to combat.

Furthermore, I offer 1.6 VTs (the cost of voting now, plus the cost of
voting next week), and 1 P-Note, to the first Player to vote against
P3832, after this message is posted.

Plenty of Proposals pass unanimously because they make changes to the
Rules that all agree are desirable. If all of these Proposals are
adopted Summarily, the value of VTs will be greatly decreased, and the
interest of the concept correspondingly lessened.

Infeasable because the Ruleset is a moving target.  Any such Proposal
will necessarily be defective in some way or another because at least
one of the Rules it seeks to amend is likely to be changed in form at
some time during the Voting Period.

Considering the proposal has an AI of 3, such measures seem
unnecessary to ensure its failure.
