Interesting. I was considering runing something like this too. 
In fact, I had thought of running a kind of "Repeal Bookie" operation -
offering odds and taking bets on which rules might be repealed in the
next few months. Has anything like that been run before? If so, how?

As these ordinances stand, it would be far to easy to collect vote
messages from the PF, and wait until very near the end of the Voting
Period, and then announce the outcome with near certainty. Of course,
all players would have this advantage, but it wouldn't make for a very
interesting game, so long as voting was Public.

It might work if only the first player to make a certain preciction 
gets the Seal, so there would be some advantage in getting your
predictions in early, balanced by the greater risk involved.

In that case, I would extend the competition to include Proposals in
the Queue but not yet distributed - maybe with more Seals on offer
if such predictions actually come true (and no payoff if they never
get distributed.)

I would definitely enter this competition if these changes were made.

Hsm... If it passes, will this rule apply to its own Voting Period?
Is their any Rule saying that you can't be punished for an Infraction
that did not exist at the time you broke it? Do we need such a rule?

I wouldn't have bothered with this, Steve. I'm not sure that it necessarily
makes the rule any more palatable to its opponents, and it is just 
annoying for its supporters. If we want to get rid of it in the future
time, we can do that ourselves, at a suitable time.

I believe the intent of "terminal" was that there would be two versions of
Probate:  terminal Probate (full liquidation of Currency holdings, such as
what we do to deregistered Players) and non-terminal Probate (limited to
forced payment of debts to the extent possible, the idea being that we could
write Rules like "When a Player is the payor of at least ten outstanding
POs,
the Notary shall ASAP place that Player into Probate").

I'm not sure that the current Rule 1601 (Probate) successfully categorizes
deregistered Players as terminal, nor am I sure that your proto would do so.

Okay, suppose the following provisions were added:

* Units of a Currency are fungible, unless the Currency is a Commodity and
  is defined by the Rules as non-fungible.
* A Transfer Order for a non-fungible Commodity must unambiguously specify
  which units of that Commodity are being transferred.
* A Payment Order for a non-fungible Commodity may specify a set of units
  of that Commodity.  A Payment Order thus specified may only be satisfied
  by a Transfer Order for the specified set of units of that Commodity.

I think the problem is that you're trying to look at Commodities as
"Currencies, but ...".  I would instead suggest looking at Currencies
as "Commodities, plus ...".

I note, however, that in my recent proto, "terminal" becomes a useless
term; the only other place in the Rules that reference it is Rule
1739, which my proto seeks to repeal.  I have therefore deleted the
definition of "terminal" from my proto.

No, because the infraction is committed at the end of the Voting
Period, and the Proposal will not become law until the announcement,
which is necessarily later.

Malcolm> Is their any Rule saying that you can't be punished for an

IMO, you cannot, because of Rule 108, but I am willing to consider
argument to the contrary.  However, an Infraction could be defined
such that conduct prior to its adoption gives rise to an Infraction
"committed" in the present.  This is the difference between
retroactive Rules, which are prohibited, and retrospective Rules,
which are permitted.

I am obliged by a prior statement of policy to vote AGAINST it solely
on the basis that the proposed RUle contains self-modifying language.

Thank you.  I think. :)

Protoproposal Chaos72 [rev. 3]

Simplify Probate

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
          entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
|         would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.

Please note that this has been recorded as a Private Payment Order,
not as a Transfer Orders, which is what I think you intended.

I don't really have a strong opinion on whether it's a submission; I
granted it that status because Morendil made an argument for it that I 
felt inclined not to reject out of hand.

Rule 1715 states

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.


Rule 478 states

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

Have I done everything that is asked of me, or is there some other rule 
which I missed.....and most of all does this mean I have sent my votes 
to a public forum????

Actually the former may not be so difficult, if you consider the idea that
a Commodity consists of a _set_ of Currencies.

In any case, one has to use some trick to add or remove fungibility.

Note that for this Rule it is enough to send the message to the Public
Forum, since the Vote Collector is subscribed there.

Well, we have made a lot of effort to ensure that agora-discussion is
_not_ equivalent to a Public Forum, but on reflection I am not sure if we
have succeeded.

At a minimum, it is a question of whether all Players were subscribed at
the time.

A thought - would it help if we renamed Payment Orders to Bills?

As others have mentioned, this changes the way we interpret the word
Proposal to include unproposed ones.  I did a quick search for the word
"Proposal" in the Ruleset and I found the following problems:

Rule 1584:  An On Hold Player is not permitted to ... make
      Proposals ...

This does not seem a reasonable requirement with the new interpretation,
and "make" should be changed to "Propose".

Rule 404:  No Rule shall have any effect which seeks to make the legality
      of making a Proposal conditional upon its content.

Here, I would suggest replacing "making" with "making or Proposing".

Rule 1605:  ... Only Proposing Entities have the right to make Proposals.
      ... in order to make a Proposal, a Proposing Entity must have an
      Executor."

Both instances of "make" should be "Propose".

Rule 106: All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall ...

I guess that "made" is harmless.

I also assume that the use of "submit" as a synonym for "Propose" in
several Rules is not a problem.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Yep.  I have done a modification in my Pine setup so it shouldn't happen
again (although it might mean that a few more people see my messages as
Quoted-Printable.)  Also, there will be a bug(*) fix in the next version
of the mail server's conversion routine.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

(*) Apparently the bug is not _really_ there, as single period lines
should be transferrable according to the proper SMTP standard, or so our
postmaster and the mail server writer seem to agree.

You could just vote for my Currency Reform, which eliminates both
Payment Orders and Transfer Orders entirely. :)

Actually, I found the following rule which applies:

Rule 1814/1 (Power=1)
Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies
      a different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.
