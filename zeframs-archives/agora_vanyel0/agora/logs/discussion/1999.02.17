'Prohibitively high' - what rot. If that were so, all Proposals would
fail. Yet many continue to pass, so-called 'prohibitions'
notwithstanding.

What has happened is that it has become somewhat more difficult to get
Proposals passed. But nothing like prohibitively so.

It seems that I'm the one who's disorganized. I can find no record of
having paid you. A Payment Order will follow.

If I had been a player, I would have called for appeal on this Judgement.
In my opinion Kolja has effective control over his Voting Tokens, because
he can at any time withdraw the Power of Attorney. Because this is an action
that would give him immediate control over the Voting Tokens, and he could
do this without any required action from any other player, this gives him
effective control over those Voting Tokens.

That's another good argument.  In fact, it's probably better than both
of mine!  I certainly encourage others to appeal this judgement.

Interesting... You give two reasons, and I give a reason, and they don't
overlap at all. Also, we both posted within one minute! I beat you by 40
seconds in posting, but my message was distributed almost three minutes
later than yours, by the way.

I haven't been able to get it to work with 2.2.1.  I probably need a

By 2.2.1 do you mean the Linux kernel?  I am just using the kernel version

don't supply the -C switch.
