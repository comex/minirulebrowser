Oh i will!.  First I am going to quote the rules he broke.  then I
point out how he had made most of the PO's so he knew about them.  I
will also point out how many players are guilty of PI because of him.
Then I will point out how he dinged me. Then I will be merciful and not
Ding I'm.

Michael, you are gravely mistaken.  As Rule 1735 states, you have a
duty of satisfying or disputing the PO's upon their issuance, not upon
their appearance in an official report.  (1)  I am quite sure you were
aware when the PO's were issued, and that you  believed they were
valid.  

Not satisfying them was really inexcusable.   I should think as sole
executor for the Bank you would know the state of the Banks funds, so
should not have feared the Bank running dry.  There are players that
have debts they could pay only if they themselves had been paid.  By
withholding their unemployment and salaries, you made it impossible for
some others to vote without committing the Crime of Debt Voting.  

I understand many players were confused by the state of their finances
without an official report, and did not issue their TO's when they
should have and I am not dinging them.  I would think that you would
not be so confused by the bank's finances in regards to salaries, as
you were both responsible for the Payment Orders and the Transfer
orders.

I did not report sooner because I was having real trouble getting the
report together.  I did not understand the intricacies of the
Accountor's report. Your failure to issue Transfer Orders that I knew
was your duty to issue confused me further.  I stepped into the
position because it seem nobody else wanted to do it. Since, I believe,
no one nominated for Accountor I am think I am correct in that
assumption. I also was under the mistaken impression that Blob was
going to do  one more report.

You dinged me for failing to report, as was your right. You have no
such excuse for failing in your duties but,  I am not dinging you as is
my right.  I have already declared that i would not ding anyone for PI
in relationship to the items in this report. I hope that in the future
a delay by another officer will not result in you unnecessarily failing
in your duties.

If you don't want to know the answer, don't ask the question.

(1) Rule 1735/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor as Bank's Executor

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or
      CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player
      makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

I am sorry, since Michael's initial message claiming to be entitled to
a report before paying salaries, i have been pestered by a few Players
to ding Michael for not paying the salaries.  

One Player said Michael was responsible for an ASAP violation for each
and every unsatisfied PO and  wanted me to report him for each one. I
refused to even consider it, i took this Player at eir word that the
rules would support it as I was busy enough revising my report.  This
Player then threatened to report him eirself.  I was loathe for this to
happen; i don't want any one to suffer Blots in any way as a direct or
indirect result of my delay in reporting.

I finally extracted an agreement that if i strongly scolded Michael e
would leave well enough alone.  When I delayed in this e threatened
once more.  My response assuring em i would scold Michael appeared in
the message scolding Michael.  I assume it got in when i quoted one of
he Rules e quoted at me.

First I hereby sign Lee's Application.  I think this is very gracious act
from the person who has probably suffered the most from this mess.

It is a legal Application.  It cannot have effect but it is by definition
legal.


> 2)  Those are Infractions, not Crimes.


You are forgetting that Michael is guilty of innumerable counts of Tardiness
which IS a crime.  He could potentially have quite a large number of Blots
hanging over his head.  Not only for the delay now, but since he has been
waiting for official Reports to issue TO's, he has probably been violating
ASAP all along.  In light of this I find it quite petty of Michael to ding
Lee who was doing the best e could in a bad situation.  I would like to see
an apology from Michael on this.

I knew it would have no legally binding effects, but it is an
Application according to Rule 1626.  I thought if a Player signed it
and then violated its content, then that would be a dishonourable act. 
Are you signing it?  I will keep track of the signatures, as the
Sponsor should.

Thank you for your support.

I have been infected by certain people around here to use "legal" in the
sense "acknowledged by the Rules".

It was not a signature, as I think we have Rule 1742 providing effective
means of doing this, rather than an ineffective Application.

I might still have signed if not for that Infraction/Crime confusion.

Hm. That double 'the' has escaped our attention for a long time. Oerjan,
what did happen to your Spring Cleaning Proposal. Care to dust it off
and revise it?

This still refers to Tardiness as a Crime, which it isn't.

I'm reluctant to sign this. While I certainly would not want to see
Michael hit with a Blot for every Salary PO he has left unsatisfied, I
think a Blot per week he's been late would be appropriate.

I don't think it's possible for me to own a negative number of VTs, is
it? Any transfers I attempted to make that would take me below zero
would just be ignored.

Am I right in thinking that the only Outstanding PO in my name is
this one:

>aaa312   02_Sep_98   04:50:32 AM   2.0   Steve   Bank   voting

If so, why are my Debts listed as amounting to 0.4 VTs?

However, it could act, and therefore gain legal force, as a binding
