Protoproposal Chaos232 [rev. 1]

Eliminate Transfer Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary shall be
      the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to execute a transfer), e
      commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfers
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
          on behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
          implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's
          Estate, as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee
          may also execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to
          implement the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      (b) The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when
          implementing a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the
          entity in Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion of the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      (a) A transfer is valid if:
        (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
            which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
            Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
            transfers on behalf of that entity;
        (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
        (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
            Currency's MUQ;
        (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
            that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
            Currency; and
        (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
            particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
            capable of being satisfied by that transfer.

      (b) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
          the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
          this Notice shall set forth:
        (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
        (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
        (3) the Currency involved;
        (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
        (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
            purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the
            requirements of another Rule.

Strictly speaking, this is our first month without Salaries. Andre did
pay salaries at the beginning of last month, quite inflated ones at that.
Of course, they were heavily taxed...

Damn, I forgot to set the Tariff back to 0.4. I had meant to only keep it
at zero for a week. Would somebody remind me to fix that, next Monday?

Steve's point is that it's too late to change it for next month.

I was legally unable to do so :

Rule 1827/1 (Power=1)
Granting or Denying Motions

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.

Protoproposal Chaos233 [rev. 1]

Merit

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has a Merit Rating, an integer, which may be
          positive, negative, or zero.  Until the Rules act to give a
          Player some other Merit Rating, a Player's Merit Rating is
          zero.  Merit Ratings shall be changed only when authorized
          by the Rules.

      (b) The Office of the Secretary is hereby established.
        (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of the Merit Rating
            of every Player.
        (2) The Secretary's Report shall include:
          (A) a schedule setting forth the Merit Rating of each
              Player; and
          (B) a description of all changes made to the Merit Rating of
              any Player since the last such Report.
        (3) The Secretary shall receive a salary equal to one and
            one-half times the Basic Officer Salary.

      (c) When an entitlement is to be randomly distributed to the
          Players, the Officer making the distribution shall use the
          following procedure (or any other procedure which results in
          each Player having the same probability of receiving the
          entitlement as e would under the following procedure):
        (1) The Officer shall, for each Player, place in a bin one
            hundred tokens bearing the name of that Player, in each
            case augmenting or diminishing that number by that
            Player's Merit Rating.  (If a Player's Merit Rating is
            less than negative one hundred, then no tokens are placed
            in the bin.)
        (2) The Officer shall then draw one token from the bin, and
            award the entitlement to the Player whose name is on the
            token.

      (d) When making a distribution the procedure described in
          subdivision (c), the Officer shall use the Merit Ratings of
          the Players reported in the most recent uncontested
          Secretary's Report, and no other.  A distribution made based
          on Merit Ratings as required by this subdivision is valid
          notwithstanding any error in the Secretary's Report which
          may later become apparent.
        (1) If the most recent uncontested Secretary's Report is more
            than twenty-one days old, the Officer may elect to delay
            the distribution until a new Report is made.  If the
            Officer elects to delay a distribution, e must announce in
            the Public Forum that e has elected to do so.
        (2) If there has never been an uncontested Secretary's Report,
            the Officer shall proceed on the assumption that every
            Player has a Merit Rating of zero.

Be it resolved, that Rules 1062, 1008, 1377, 1872 and 1378 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has Honour, which is measured in Kudos.  Each
          Player possesses at all times an integral number of Kudos,
          not less than zero.

      (b) When a Player registers, eir Honour is set:
        (1) to twenty Kudos, if, for the three months immediately
            prior to eir most recent registration, that Player was not
            at any time registered as a Player; otherwise,
        (2) to whatever eir Honour was at the time e was last
            deregistered.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Office of the Herald is hereby established.

      (b) The Herald shall receive a salary equal to twice the Basic
          Officer Salary.

      (c) The Herald's Report includes the following:
        (1) the Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
            time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
            since the last posting of the Herald's Report, including
            the reason for such change provided by the Player which
            initiated it, if any.
        (2) The Currency Records for Indulgences.
        (3) A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
            Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any Player may, twice in each week, transfer a Kudo from one
          Player to another (thereby reducing the Honour of the first
          by one, and increasing the Honour of the second by one), by
          Public Forum Announcement, provided the following conditions
          hold:
        (1) the Player whose Honour is to be increased is not the
            Player causing the changes;
        (2) the Player whose Honour is to be decreased has at least
            one Kudo;
        (3) the Player causing the transfer has neither transferred a
            Kudo away from the Player whose Honour is to be reduced,
            nor transferred a Kudo to the Player whose Honour is to be
            increased, at any prior time during that Nomic Week; and
        (4) the announcement sets forth a reason for the transfer.

      (b) The Herald may, once in each month, increase the Honour of
          any Player by one, by Public Forum Announcement, provided
          the following conditions are met:
        (1) the Player whose Honour is to be increased is not the
            Herald; and
        (2) the announcement sets forth a reason for the award.

      (c) This Rule does not in any way prohibit other Rules from
          defining other means by which a Player's Honour may be
          changed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Samurai is a Player whose Honor is more than thirty Kudos.

      (b) Whenever a Player is a Samurai, that Player has at least as
          much Honor as every other Player, and that Player does not
          already hold the Patent Title of Shogun, that Player is
          automatically awarded the Patent Title of Shogun.

      (c) The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
          Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      (d) Thie Patent Title of Shogun shall not be awarded or revoked
          except as specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence
          over any Rule which would permit otherwise.

      (e) The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a
          Player receives or loses the Patent Title of Shogun, as soon
          as possible after such award or revocation occurs.

            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.

              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.
