A case in point. This will unambiguously pick out your Proposal 'Ten
Days is Too Long', despite the typo. R754 governs.

Such cases are rare, and when they occur, date of submission can be used
to disambiguate.

Non-unique names happen but rarely, and error in reproduction is of
little consequence, since the reference need only be unambiguous to pick
out a Proposal. Such references are covered by the relatively lax
standards of R754, not the extremely stringent standards of R1339.
Finally, as Blob points out, errors in reproduction of numbers (or other
ID tags from an alphanumeric sequence), are much more likely to result
in another valid tag, leading to the problems identified in the
discussion of my option (2).

I won't nominate again. With no salary in sight for a few more weeks,
and my PhD thesis in its last stages of writing up, I guess I'm better
off with the no-work Ambassador job (I'll have a proposal coming up
concerning this).

The Promotor is hereby requested and encouraged to increase the size
of the Weekly Proposal Batch.  There are now seven Proposals in the
Queue with nonzero priority.  With the current batch size, it will
take four weeks to clear these out, which in my opinion is too long.
Please increase the batch size to at least three, and preferably
four.  Thank you.
<<

There are, of course, two ways to get important proposals past the
R-O-M stuff. One is the political way: putting pressure on the
officials. This is what Scott is trying with the preceding mail. The
other is the economic way: paying more P-notes, so the R-O-M stuff is
left behind.

For my recent proposal to abandon the Ambassador's office I chose the
latter, because I think that now, at long last, the small proposal
batch size begins to make the P-note sector of the economy
meaningful. For this reason (and certainly _not_ to make Scott's life
harder, or to spite him) I would urge the Promotor to keep the abtch
size at two until there are at least, say, three weeks' worth of
substantial proposals in the queue (i.e. not counting minor tweaks and
R-O-M proposals).

Making the batch size three or four now will, IMNSHO, turn the P-note
stuff into another white elephant. <conspiracy theory mode> Maybe
that's what Scott is trying to do ?</conspiracy theory mode>

Firstly, there are only five proposals in the Queue with non-zero 
Priority, not seven. The recently published Queue was shown to still 
contain two proposals which were in fact distributed last week.

Secondly, I agree with Kolja that the whole point of the Queue mechanism
is to have more proposals pending in the Queue than will be distributed,
so that the is some jockeying for better positions in the Queue. For the
first time in a long while, we have a proposal in the Queue with Priority
greater than one, and I am delighted. 

For these reasons and, as Kolja says, not out of spite, I will not be
increasing the Batch size just yet. Of course, if Gen Chaos committed 
some of his P-Notes (of which he now has plenty, after Macross' kind
donation) and the number of pending proposals was increased, I might
reconsider.

I am reluctant to spend P-Notes to raise the priority of Proposals
this close to the end of the month.  Doing so would be effectively be
wasting those P-Notes, since any Proposals I spend P-Notes on that do
not get distributed by then (which, given the current state of the
Queue, seems likely) will be wasted, at least partially.
