I argue that the first sentence of R869 should be interpreted as
  "X is a Player <-> X is registered as a Player"
which, together with Rule 103, forms a procedure for registering
Morendil as a result of eir becoming Speaker.

1671 doesn't need precedence over 206; 206 basically says "Voting Entities
may Vote unless another Rule says otherwise", and 1671 does say otherwise.

1698 doesn't trigger because there are ways to become a Frankenstein
Monster:  be the Rulekeepor, be a Contestmaster, etc.

1.)  The original Rules did not have the definition of a Player as someone
registered.

2.)  At the time I first registered (in September 1994?), I believe Michael
was not playing; he re-registered later.

I believe I was On Hold during this period (it was when I was shifting
from NZ to England).  As far as I'm aware, I have been registered
continuously since the game began.

I think it starts with something like:
"The first who has correctly translated this regulation..." but after that I'm
completely in the dark.

I think the point of this ordinance is that _you_ are supposed to
translate this. Using the similarities of Norwegian and German, I'd
say the first part means "The first person to translate this ordinance
correctly will...". My guess for the rest is "...receive the title of
contest leader" - Oerjan?

100 FM's   Currency  Minted by Swann's Frankenstein Contest
<<

I don't want to bother Murphy with a COE (yet), but I think this
shouldn't be valid. The minting of this currency didn't work because
of a name collision with the already existing FMs. And even if it did,
just giving something the name of FM doesn't make it an FM in the

Uh, what name collision ? The "Orders" currency that I minted were
deemed to be perfectly legal entities which only happened to be know
by the same label as the Rule-defined Orders; the argument being
that an entity's name has to be defined as such by the Rules. That
would seem to me to apply here too; we have a Rule-defined entity
(or entities) known as Frankenstein Monsters, and Player-created 
Currencies with the name 'Frankenstein Monsters'.

Then again, your latter argument sounds right, as I suppose that
Game Custom in the "Orders" currency issue also means that Swann's
Frankenstein Monsters are not the same kind of entity that the
Frankenstein Rule refers to.

Well, quite :-)

I suppose I should have said "I believe I have been a Player
continuously since the game began".

If someone is particularly keen on this, they might want to trawl
through the archives for September 94.  They might then be able to
unearth some facts to resolve what is now reliant on vague memories.

Michael.

"This can only be done once by any Player for any single Proposal."

_I_ would rather suggest that you need (stronger?) glasses. :-)

Hm, that sentence itself is ambiguous.  Does it mean that only one
Player may do (it) on any given Proposal, or that _each_ Player may do
(it) on any given Proposal?

I don't think the notion of an animal "owning" things is contrary to common
sense, but certainly the notion of their having the ability to control and
exercise rights over most property goes against common sense.

IMHO this is the current situation-- however, I think it might be
interesting if the FM rule mutates out of ome of the Currency
Rules.  If the FM suddenly talks about transfering FM's, or the Mintor
of an FM, the phrase will suddenly have a natual meaning. . .
