Andre,

Have you actually registered? The recent Registrar's Report does not say 
so. If you have, can you give me the date of the message?

For a while, I've felt that it would be nice to have an agora-chat
mailing list for off-topic (i.e., non-Agora related) discussions.

Agora is the closes thing to an online community that I've
ever been involved with, and I have a high respect for
Agorans and Agoraphobes.  From time to time I've thought
of things that I would have liked to discuss among us,
but alas, they were completely unrelated to the game.

There are now at least three services which allow free mailing
lists to be set up, the cost being a bit of advertising with
the messages.  egroups.com (previously findmail) seems to
be the most popular.

Would people be interested in having such a list?  Or am
I the only person who feels this way?

Chuck

Heh.  I'm trying to import the ruleset into a SQL database, and am, in
the process, trying to make sure that each Rule gets properly snoggled
into its proper pieces.  Annotations go in one table, rule text in
another, history information in yet another.  (The history info is
obnoxious because most, but not all, history lines are associated with
a change of amendment number.)

I've sinced discovered that at least some CFJ annotations got
suctioned into the rule text (which means that my scripts failed to do
the Right Thing).  There are a small enough number of these things
that I will probably fix them manually.

BTW, the SQL statement to spit out the entire Ruleset (not including
annotations or historical info is):

        select rules.r_rulenum,rules.r_amendnum,r_title,r_power,
               rulecats.cat_name,ruletext.ruletext 
          from rules 
            left join rulespan using (r_rulenum,r_amendnum) 
            left join rulecats on r_catnum = cat_no 
            left join ruletext on rules.r_rulenum = ruletext.rulenum 
                              and rules.r_amendnum = ruletext.amendnum
          where (d_start is NULL or d_start < now()) 
            and (d_end is NULL or d_end > now()) 
          order by r_catnum, r_catorder

(Some of my field name choices are less than advisable in hindsight.)

One of the nice things about this database is that it's possible to
spit out an old Ruleset, by replacing now() with the date for which
you want a Ruleset.  (This is, of course, subject to whether the
information necessary to spit the Ruleset out is in the database,
which it won't be because I don't have very deep archives.)

I have not kept the message that I received back, but I sent it

Isn't agora-discussion already available for this kind of material?
Anyway, if you want to set up such a list, I have just to send an
email to my majordomo-manager, and a (free) list will be created
within a few days. No need to get to some commercial free listserv.

I hereby execute a Transfer Order, with the following properties:

Seems to me that we conduct off-topic conversations all the time. :)

I've never noticed a problem.  It's not like agora-discussion is a
high-traffic list.

I would have thought Kolja's minimalist Proposal was a good candidate
for discarding.

Protoproposal Chaos39 [rev. 2]

Every Man Is an Island

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617, 1458
and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738 and 1757 be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

Protoproposal Chaos35 [rev. 3]

Restore Sanity

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each
          Proposal.

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon Proposals.

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message
          to the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the
          Proposal upon which it is cast.

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if:
        (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
            the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from Voting
            upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then in
            effect barring em from doing so,
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 be amended to read:

There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall receive
a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
          exercise the right given by subdivision (a) of this Rule
          twice in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same
          Player is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this
          right three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
          interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
          subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
word "zero" with "one" wherever it appears.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1442, 1765, 1715, 1824, 1660, 1760,
1723, 1724, 1772 and 1862 be repealed.
