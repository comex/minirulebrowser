My main problem is that there are too many appeals, period. What I'd
like is a fee, of say 25 VT's to make an appeal. I thought this was
a relatively minor penalty. Sigh...

This is a bit harmless, just to designate the week like this, don't
you think? I'm not for a penalty for not reading the rules in this
week, but what about a kind of competition? Like: 

Every player who posts, in private email to the rulekeepor, the
correct number of unmotivated occurrences of the word "Regellesewoche"
in the special, not-legal-for-gameplay "Read the Ruleset Week" edition
of the FLR, gets paid an eager reader award of 3 VTs.

P.S. "Regellesewoche" is German for "Read the Ruleset Week".

On that perhaps we can only agree to disagree.  I do not think

First, what do you mean by "unmotivated?"

Second, this would prove nothing, as it's easy enough to use
search functions.

Third, I'm not particularly interested in having to produce
a special, not-legal-for-gameplay FLR.

Fine with me. I'm just afraid this rule might turn out to be another,
well, harmless and also quite fruitless one - not exactly a white
elephant, but similar in status to other rules and concepts (like
P-notes, silliness etc) that are in the rules, but rarely used or not
very effective. And at the moment I see a tendency (and welcome it) to
get rid of such things rather than introduce more of them. Of course,
there is nothing really important to say against your proposal,
either.

It seems to me that this would cause any other Authors of this
Rule to cease to be Authors.  Comments?

(Further, even if this is not the case, this provision is irrelevant
at best--Zefram is already an Author of 1042.)

Vlad, you're getting confused. The above was a response to Kolja's
suggestion that we broaden the pool of Appeal Justices to Active
Senators, not to your suggestion that we penalize Appellants if the
original Judgement is upheld.

The reasons have everything to do with it. The Board often uncovers
things that the original Judge did not consider: prior precedent, 
Rules whose relevance the original Judge may have missed, an
interpretation not seen. This may lead to the original Judgement
being upheld for completely different reasons than was originally
thought. That is important when considering what precedents the
Judgement sets.

Right. I meant 'actions relevant to the game'.

Well, I won't support any Proposal which uses 'he' as the pronoun of
unspecified sex. I wonder if enough of the other Players feel the same
to change your mind?

(I know this must be hard for a classicist like yourself.)

Hm. It just occurred to me that perhaps Vlad meant that he has never
used 'em', although he has used 'e' and 'eir'.

I certainly did issue a Judgement, and promptly, too. I believe I
sent it to the Public Forum, so it should be retrievable from the
Archives.

I am not suggesting that it does. I just thought you should be aware of

Andre's statistics show that only 5 of the last 23 Judgements have
been Appealed. Why is this too many?

Secondly: 25 VTs? Are you serious?

I think it's OK because the wording of R1042 has changed so radically
in its last few amendments that any contribution from the Authors
of R1042/5 and prior versions has now been erased.

I do have a tiny qualm because the CFJ is talking about a general
situation and not the specific Infractions, but I think it's probably
OK. Thanks for pointing that out.

Certainly.  Everyone knows that natural law dictates that access to
justice must be conditioned on the ownership of property.

I know the filing fee in the US for an _initial_ action in district
court is $120.  I have no idea what the fee is in the Supreme Court,
but do note that any written motion must be submitted to the Clerk in
40 copies (but this number does not apply to in forma pauperis
parties).

Some of the CFJ's affected people who, like me, aren't eager to appeal
even when the decision goes against them. Others are insubstantial.

Partly. I prefer decisions to be quick, and I don't usually care even
if they are quirky. Allowing unusual interpretations, perhaps even
"wrong" ones, is okay by me, since it allows the game to adapt to
the Players in ways not normally possible. I think appeals ought to
be limited to cases in which a Judgement threatens to seriously
unbalance the game, or when a severe injustice has been committed.
I think consistence is a reasonable alternative to seek for, and
I understand why you strive for it. But then, why keep the system
of single Judges at all?

What I mean is, why should I think that the phrase "past Judgements" means
the arguments or reasoning accompanying the Judgments?
