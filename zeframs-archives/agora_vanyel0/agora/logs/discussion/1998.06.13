Would whoever's working on Plot Repair (beyond the one by Murhpy
that just passed) please send me the latest version of the proto?
I noticed some problems myself, but I haven't been following the
discussion very closely so it may be that they've already been addressed.

>Proposal 3760 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
>Avoid inflation, encourage specialization
>
>Create a rule with the title "Officers may not own plots" and the text: 

Currently, as Rulekeepor, I earn 0.8 VTs a week.  Currently, I may
also own Plots and gain currencies that way as well.

If this were to pass, I would earn only 0.8 VTs a week as Rulekeepor.
Or, I could resign my office, build 2 Mines and 1 Farm, and net 1 VT and
1 Erg per week.  Hardly an incentive to be Rulekeepor!

If P3760 passes, it seems I have a number of options:

1.  Continue to be Rulekeepor, at a relative loss compared to what I
    could make unemployed.  I see no rational reason to do this.
2.  Try to get one or more other Offices in addition to Rulekeepor.  Even
    if I wanted the extra responsibility (I do not), it is not an easy
    matter to get an office.
3.  Lobby the Chancellor to increase the BOS.  A simple, and reasonable
    solution.
4.  If (3) fails, impeach the Chancellor and get one who will increase
    the BOS.  (Or, replace the Chancellor by other means, such as Rebellion,
    "encouraging" him to step down, or whatever.)  A somewhat lengthy process.
5.  Resign as Rulekeepor and become a Miner/Farmer/whatever.

(I'd be interested in hearing if there's any options I've missed.)

I was made Rulekeepor in perpetuity without a single objection from 
any Agoran.  I generally try keep a humble sense of this, but now,
I feel, is the time to speak up.  Agorans felt (either unanimously,
or if anyone disagreed e did not do so strongly enough to speak up)
that I was doing such a good job at Rulekeepor that I should not have
to face the normal quarterly elections that most Officers face.  I
hope I am not being arrogant in inferring this, but it seems to me
that Agorans thus have a strong preference to see me continue as Rulekeepor.

Be forewarned that if P3760 passes, there is a distinct possibility
that I will resign as Rulekeepor.  I do not expect a huge salary, but
I do expect that as Rulekeepor I will be compensated better than
an unemployed Agoran--something which would be in jeopardy if P3760
passed.

In a more general sense, P3760 will make it unprofitable for most
Agorans to be Officers.  The above analysis was for Rulekeepor, which
makes *twice* the basic officer salary.  Think how much worse it would be
for Officers who make only a single BOS!

Of course, much of this depends on the BOS.  Perhaps if P3760 passed,
the Chancellor would raise the BOS to 1.5 VTs or so, which would
make it reasonable for an Officer making only 1 BOS to remain in
Office rather than resign.  But it seems to me that a BOS of 1.5 VTs
would circulate more VTs than most Agorans would like to see.  (I would
be interested on hearing the Chancellor's thoughts on what an
appropriate BOS would be if P3760 passed.)

In short, if you wish to discourage Agorans (and me, in particular)
from holding office, then by all means pass P3760!

Is 'G.' me?  And if so, why am I being paid an Indulgence?
