A nice enumeration of the possible positions. All the instances of '639'
should be changed to '693'. I'm still thinking about the substance.

Um, Scott, since you claim not to believe in events, can you please
explain what you mean by the above?

My only problem with this statement is that I have no idea how to tell
the difference between changing the legal effect of an act, and
attaching new meaning to past events. Aren't these just exactly the
same?

Read "acts" for "events".  I used the term "events" in the generic or
colloquial sense, not in the specific sense that others have been
using lately.  (Specifically, I deny that "the end of the voting
period" is an "event".)

No, I don't think so.  Attaching new meaning is a retrospective act;
changing old meanings is a retroactive act.

Of course, one could attach a new meaning that completely overrides or
renders inapplicable the old meaning, but I believe that this should
be the disfavored interpretation, adopted only no other interpretation
is plausible, or when the language of the statute clearly requires it.
Several rules seem to support this position: Rule 101, Rule 108, Rule
1586.

Absurd ? Not that much. If we were to remove the viral sentence
completely, we could say that "the infection period" never ended,
but we could at the same time say that the Rule was effective - and
rightly so, since it would then contain no provisions which might 
restrict its effect... IOW, the distinction between "the infection 
period ended" and "the Rule is no longer infected" is analogous to
that between "the Voting Period ended" and "the Rules no longer
define the current time as part of the Voting Period".

(Am I making sense ? Past 2AM I always have to wonder...)

This is verbal mashing, as far as I can tell.

I'm starting to think even more that we need an "actual controversy"
requirement on CFJs.
