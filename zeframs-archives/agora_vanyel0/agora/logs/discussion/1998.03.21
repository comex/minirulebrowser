With regard to the P3710/P3710* debate, I have looked over the relevant
rules and find that the rules are not exactly specific on this matter.
My opinion, and I can find nothing in the rules to contradict it, is
that P3710 was distributed, but it was distributed with a typo in it.
This seems to be the most obvious common-sense conclusion, and I think
we all recognise that it is what really happened.

Now, R107 says that the rule changed in P3710 must be adopted in the 
form they were voted on - typo and all - and R1339 is pretty clear 
in stating that the missing ">" means that the final rule change in 
the proposal will not take effect, but I can see nothing which stops
the rest of the proposal from being valid and from having effect.

I realise that you could argue that if this typo is allowed to pass
then where are we to draw the dividing line between "sufficiently 
similar" and "significantly different". I don't think that such a line
could be drawn in adavance - each case should be examined on its own
merits, with common sense as our guide. There is no need to be so 
nit-picky as to demand exactitude on every occasion. It only makes the
game tedious. 

As to whether it would set a dangerous precedent - I don't see how it 
could. R107 makes sure that the text must be adopted in the form it was
voted on, so to possibility of exploitation is fairly minimal. And I
think we can trust our Promotors to obey the rules to the best of their
ability - I can't imagine anyone deliberately changing a proposal in
this way.

Judging that P3710 was not distributed would however set up a precedent,
and a bad one in my opinion. It would set the precedent of excessive
nit-picking in the face of common sense and the interests of the game.
I thought Agora was at last escaping from this attitude. Let's not
go back to the bad old days.
