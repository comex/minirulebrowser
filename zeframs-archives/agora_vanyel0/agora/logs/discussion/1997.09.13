Hear, hear! Why make so much trouble for the CotC and, indeed, everyone, when dismissal is so 
much easier and simpler?

Ahhh, I see. This Rule is rather awkward, but it's the only way that Groups and other non-players 
can reasonably own Plots. Hmmm.

Much as I appreciate having my contributions to the game recognized,
this transfer away from General Chaos was certainly unwarranted. The
Registrar Election concluded at Monday, 8 Sep 1997 07:54:17 UTC; 
General Chaos' announcement of this fact came at Thu, 11 Sep 1997
23:10:11 UTC, well under four days later, well within the one week
period demanded by R1445 and in my opinion certainly not an excessive
delay. It's necessity I would say only Scott is truly in a position
to judge, but as he has a wife, two young children, and is studying
part time while trying to run his own business, I'd be inclined to
cut him some slack if any were needed, which in this case it wasn't.

I think you know what the Honourable course is, Zefram.

Re: Plots v1.0

Not a bad formulation. I'm not clear on what the purpose of a Mule is.
I haven't looked closely enough at it to tell whether it is economically
balanced or not. I'll peruse in greater depth soon.

BTW: I would like it (and I think Antimatter would too) if it could be
arranged that we have some credit for originating these ideas. If the rules
allow, I would like there to be a clause in the proposal that lists Antimatter
and myself as Authors.

Er, I think you mean Proposal 3550. But the Assessor may choose to regard

Perhaps. My apologies to Robert Shimmin for getting his name wrong.

That possibility did occur to me while I was writing the article,
but the article was already very long, it was getting late, and I
thought a discussion of that point would take me too far afield.

I also considered including an objection that the other-repealing Rule
might specify a random Rule to be repealed, in which case it's even
less plausible that a vote for the other-repealing Rule is a vote
for the repeal of the rule randomly selected to be repealed.

I know. I wrote that paragraph of Agora's R1339 :)

Actually, I did answer the first question - when did Agora adopt the
view of rule changes contrary to (*)? - in the essay, when I said that
I and the other founders of Nomic World just assumed without argument
that (*) was false from the outset, and proceeded from there. It would
be interesting to know at exactly what point we became explicitly and
practically committed to the falsity of (*), ie, when we first adopted
a Rule with other-directed rule changes contained in it. I think probably
not for some time, which was why we didn't really notice the tension
between our assuming the falsity of (*) and the language of the Initial
Set.

As to what it takes to turn a Suberian Ruleset into an Agoran one, I
suppose the obvious answer is that the cocept of 'rule change' has to
be clarified or modified in the appropriate ways. R103 (in Agora, R105)
is fine as it is, but the other Rules, which speak of rule change being
proposed, voted on and adopted, need to have that language altered.
In Agora, over time, all references to rule changes being proposed,
voted on or adopted have been removed from the Ruleset and replaced by
talking of Proposals being proposed, voted on and adopted, and having 
various effects, among them rule changes, which, implicitly or expicitly,
can then be thought of as also being possible as the result of the effect
or action of a Rule.

If I were writing an Initial Set now, I'd pay close attention to this
distinction and talk only of proposals, not rule changes, being adopted.
That's not to say that I'd necessarily allow non-proposed rule changes
in my Initial Set. I might explicitly disallow them, since the resulting
system is simpler and tidier as Michael has noted, and that's a good
property for an Initial Set to have. (Maybe. On the other hand, maybe
it's good for the Initial Set to contain some conceptual tensions in it,
to give some kind of dynamic impetus to the game as the players try to
work them out in various ways.)

And, in fact, I will, following a precedent I previously set when
someone else made an similar typo.

It will now be up to the Judge of CFJ 942 to determine if CFJ 938 really
is a CFJ. If it is, then this is my Judgement; if not, then this is just
a message with no legal significance.

I Judge the Statement TRUE. Clearly any body of text that a Player has
read has been made available to that Player, under any definition of
what it means to be 'made available'. I don't necessarily accept the
suggestion made by the Caller that having been read by the Player is
a necessary condition for a text to have been made available to that
Player, but it certainly is sufficient.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended, by replacing "iv)
Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules." with "iv) The act of
making it was in violation of the Rules."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 991 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

with

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement,
      without regard to whether the act of submitting that document as
      a Call for Judgement is prohibited by other Rules.  This Rule
      takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent a document
      delivered in the manner described above from being a Call for
      Judgement.

Mines are supposed to have an upkeep. Upkeeps are paid monthly, 
production is weekly.

Welcome to Agora! (Eek, I've just realized that over ten players have registered since me. I have 
been playing Agora for over nine months. Wow.)

On another note: my mail system seems to have unglitched itself finally, so I probably won't have 
any other problems, but could someone please forward me all Agora mail from Friday at 4:00 US 
Eastern Time till now, since I seem to have been unsubbed from the lists (probably because my 
mail bounced due to being over quota)? Thanks, everyone.
