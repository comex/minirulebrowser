I've just realised that my call for nominations for the post of
Registrar was not valid, as I am not the person who runs that
Election.  This is instead something that Speaker Steve has to do. 
I was the only person to have nominated for Registrar, but I'll need
to do so again when Steve announces the election properly.

DIS: RE: RE: proto: Make Being On Hold Safe Again

Because the situation arises only when the PO is issued *after* the Player has
already made the announcement the e is going On Hold, unless you want to make
it possible to issue a blanket stay on all POs being issued, rather than on a
specific PO, which I think the Rules require at this time.

Why not have the announcement of going on and off hold Implicitly Order the
stay and implicitly vacate the stay?

Automatic stays should be cautiously implemented; they need to arise
only in situations where miminal ambiguity can exist over whether the
causative condition holds.

I myself actually have a few objections to doing it in the manner way I
suggested, but I was hoping to elicit some comments from both sides.

Simply require the Officer of record in the matter to Stay the Order if the
Player is On Hold.  When the Player comes off Hold the Office will then
vacate the stay.

The main problem I have with the approach is that when a Stay is vacated,
"the previously stayed order again has effect as if it had been originally
executed at the moment the stay ceases to be effective."  This would allow a
Player to permanently avoid a PO by use of the Hold mechanism.
