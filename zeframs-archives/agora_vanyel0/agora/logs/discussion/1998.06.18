Instead of contacting players privately I'd like to try and drum up
support for P3763 with this mail to a-d. P3763 will reduce awards for
successful IN proposals made by Agora players to realistic levels.

It is clear why such a change is desirable; on the other hand, this is
a small tweak, and a good candidate for a proposal liked by everyone
that fails quorum nevertheless because people save their VTs for more
important matters.

Let me just say that I'll limit my support for this proposal to the
P-note I needed to get it distributed, and the VT for one vote for
this. If you let it fall through, that'll be fine with me - I have
made many recent IN proposals, and just made a fortune in IN rewards a
few days ago. I'll do it again, if you let me. So I'm afraid there'll
be no bribes to be gained from voting for this (at least not from me),
but the arguments are all for P3763, anyway.

'Nuff said,

Rule 1578 might:

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibilty until a new
      Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
      Recordkeepor, then all units of that Currency are destroyed and
      the Currency ceases to exist.
<<

You mean because the office of Cartographor didn't exist for some time
(between the adoption of P3743 and that of Plot repair), so the
currency e is recordkeepor for vanished?

At first sight I'm tempted to agree. But look at the exact wording of
1578: it says

If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a Player,
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So it clearly refers to the situation where such a recordkeepor
deregisters. But who (which _player_) ceased to be a player in our
case? With the adoption of 3743 the _office_ of cartographor ceased to
exist; P3744 then reintroduced references to this office. Of course,
after P3744 took effect, no rules explicitly defined this office; you
may also say that the identity of the Cartographor wasn't clear. 

But I'm not sure this really triggers 1578 and the corresponding
destruction of Ergs. 

You may say that at this time there was "no procedure defined for
selecting a new Recordkeepor" (1578), but 1578 only checks the
existence of such a procedure after a recordkeepor ceased to be a
player, not continuously. 

Blob, how should we continue this debate - should I make a COE on your
Erg holdings report, or a CFJ, or do you want to change your mind
informally?

The voting period on P3760 has ended, but I thought I'd reply nonetheless.

I'm flattered that you think it's worth that much, but I don't
think my job is more difficult than that of Promotor,
for example, so I don't think an increase to 4 BOS is warranted.
But perhaps I'm underestimating the work it takes, since I put
in a lot of front-end time to write scripts to automate many
of my functions, so that the actual week-to-week updating
doesn't take too much time.

>affair)

Perhaps that's because I don't consciously differentiate between
my role-playing self and my metagaming self.  I do recognize
the difference, and it's a bit odd that I don't distinguish
them better, because I do in many other games.  (Such as
Diplomacy.  In fact, I think in Diplomacy you pretty
much have to distinguish them to like the game; otherwise,
how do you stand that much betrayal?  But I digress.)
Perhaps it's because nomic is so unlike any other game.
I tend to think of Agora as much a society as a game--perhaps
that's why I have trouble differentiating between my role-playing
self and my metagaming self.

I think you're trying to have your cake and eat it too.  I should
take being made an Officer in Perpetuity--an in-game move, I note--
as an extra-game symbol of Agorans' gratitude; but I should not take
P3760 as a symbol of Agorans' feelings about me.

You can't have it both ways.  If I should view P3760 dispassionately,
as just part of the game, and not necessarily as saying anything
about me, then it seems to me that I should also take being
mad an Officer in Perpetuity dispassionately, as just a game
move, likewise saying nothing about my abilities in the Office.

Fair enough.  I certainly am not Rulekeepor solely for the salary--I'm
Rulekeepor because I think Agora is a worthy endeavour, and it's
worthwhile to put time into it for its own sake.  At the same time,
I recognize that I serve a function vital to the smooth continuance
of Agora, and I expect some recognition for that.  Not just
extra-game notes of appreciation, either, but in-game rewards.
To me, notes of thanks for a job well done from lots of Agorans--who
then vote to abolish the Rulekeepor's salary (hypothetically, of course)--
ring false.

In other words, to me metagaming and roleplaying are not 100%, completely
distinct--there is a bearing of one on the other.  But to make
the distinction:

In a roleplaying sense, if P3760 passed, I might resign Rulekeepor
from purely an economic perspective.

In a metagaming sense, if P3760 passed, I might resign Rulekeepor
not directly due to the economic concerns, but rather due to the
fact that P3760 passed indicates to me that Agorans do not have
much respect for Officers.  In other words, in a metagaming
sense, I am not concerned so much about the direct effect of P3760,
as much as I am concerned about how P3760 may be symptomatic of
Agorans' attitudes.

(Clarification: I do not take any offense at the proposing of P3760.
I believe that any subject is a valid topic for discussion, either
in the informal forum of a-d, or in the formal sense of a Proposal.
It is the adoption of P3760 which may cause me to take offense.)

I've completed a restructuring of my Agora pages (which focus
on the Rules).  I haven't added much in the way of functionality
since I last announced the addition of the Rules Search function,
but I hope I have made the pages more easily navigable.  One
function I have added, in the Categorized Rule Lists and
Rules Search results, is a "All these on one page" button which allows
the text of all retrieved Rules to be displayed on a single web
page.  (This may be particularly useful if you like to print
out hard copies.)

I invite everyone to visit the pages at http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/

I disagree with this analysis. I see no reason not to think that 
the case where the Cartographor ceases to be an Office is a situation
in which the Recordkeepor for Ergs has ceased to be a Player.

You personally? I certainly think you should not take P3760 as any
kind of expression about people's feelings about you personally.
Granted, it has problematic side-effects, but clearly it is motivated by
abstract policy considerations and not by any judgements about the
worth of the contributions of individual Players. 

I'm about to publish a Voting Report showing that P3760 has passed.
I think you've successfully shown that the Proposal creates problems,
which must be addressed. But I hope you'll at least hold off, if not
drop altogether, your threat to resign, and allow some time for 
remedial legislation to be framed.

I'm not interested in VTs, I'm interested in P-Notes.

Since Plots don't seem to be working at the moment, I don't
have any in-game motivation to resign Rulekeepor yet.
1/2 :)

I have only 1 P-Note at the moment, and I wouldn't use it to
buy an Indulgence anyway--I'll be using it if I'm unable
to purchase the necessary Indulgences.
