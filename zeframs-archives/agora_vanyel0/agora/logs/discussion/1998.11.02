A vacation is the only way (presently) to achieve a reversing order.

You'd have to generate the reversing order directly.

I believe that Kolja and General Chaos have both submitted Proposals
since "A Duty to Propose" was adopted. Hence that their dates of
change of Public Service Status will have been altered, and they will
have been moved to the bottom of the list.

I was getting around to that...

I can see one thing that is wrong with Murphy's messages and that might be
trapped by a syntax check - since many spammers seem terminally unable to
create a well-formed mail message, that has become a rather popular thing
to check in a spam filter.

Message-ID: <000001be04c4$8f6dee40$9ea16bc7@friend-computer>

"friend-computer" is not a full Internet address.  I suggest selecting
something containing a period.

There is also the possibility of something wrong in the From envelope,
which I cannot see since the lists strip it away.  Murphy, if the above
doesn't work could you send me a personal message to check?

Greetings,
Ørjan.

You miss the point. It seemed to me that in this case 1768 applied 
quite clearly because, rather than there being "clear and convincing
evidence" in favour of the Caller's side, none at all was offered. 
(And none has been offered so far, either.) It seems to me that 1768 
is about burden of proof, and that in the instance at hand that fell 
squarely upon Chaos' shoulders.

Re: DIS: Proto: Simplify Currency Handling v 2

elJefe asks:

I guess I don't see any pressing reason why the Chancellor should ever *have*
to destroy units in the Bank.  They don't (currently) have any effect on the
game by just sitting around in the Bank.

I suppose it wouldn't hurt for the Chancellor to continue to be the Bank's
executor in addition to the other changes, but I thought it was better for two
reasons:  1)  It takes discretionary control of units of Currency in the Bank
away from any particular Player; 2) since the Rules would authorize other
Players besides the Chancellor to transfer units from the Bank, it seemed more,
um, symmetrical to have none of them as executor (maybe even less confusing?).

Anybody else have strong feelings about this?

I take it to mean all information that an Officer publishes, or 
reports on, as a result of being required to do so. Your mileage may
vary.

There are systems of court where the Judge only considers evidence
provided by the parties, and there are systems where the Judge has an
independent duty to find and investigate evidence.  Agora has the latter
type.

You misapplied Rule 1768.  The act of finding that an Infraction
occured is not subject to Rule 1768.

It forces the recordkeepor of each currency to keep track of the
holder of each and every office, and further requires em to make
determinations of law to decide whether a given transfer from the bank
by a given officer is legal under the circumstances.  All this must be
done before e can record the transfer (and, further, can be
interpreted so that a transfer recorded in error is such that no
transfer actually took place).  This places a substantial burden on
recordkeepors, and further can creates indeterminancy in currency
records during periods of uncertainty regarding officeholders or over
the circumstances in which a given officer may require a payment from
the bank.

The current system avoids almost all of this: the only officer a
recordkeepor needs to keep track of is the chancellor, and the
recordkeepor need not concern emself with whether the transfer is
authorized beyond that it was ordered by the chancellor.  The
chancellor is obliged to investigate the legality of payments to be
made from the bank, but e is allowed up to seven days to do so, and
eir error will not create uncertainty in currency holdings no matter
how the dice shake out.

I believe the modifications you suggest increase the chance for error
and increase the potential for rippling effects of error, and thus
should be eschewed on that basis.

My CFJ did not allege that the Assesor made any error in reporting; it
alleged that the Assessor made an incorrect conclusion of law.  The
conclusion of law is what was in error; the report of his conclusion
was a correct report of his incorrect conclusion.

There is some merit in Scott's criticism here, since the Chancellor has that
seven days to determine whether or not a Payment Order naming the Bank as payor
is legitimate.  If e is in doubt, e can punt to the courts and the Banks
holdings are not in dispute during this period.  But the Recordkeepors actually
have the same option wrt Transfer Orders, although the consequences of punting
the problem to the courts *does* leave the gamestate in a more precarious
position - but only because of the requirement that TOs be recorded in the
order received, regardless of disputes.  If a TO disputed by a Recordkeepor is
not actually processed until the dispute is resolved, the Bank's holdings will
be just as well determined under the new system as in the old.

There would still be one slight difference to which, I suspect, Scott will
object.  If the Recordkeepor honors an invalid TO by mistake, the transfer will
have occurred before anyone else can object.  Under the current system, this
situation doesn't happen until the Chancellor has issued the satisfying TO, so
other Players can also effectively block the transfer by disputing the PO
before the Chancellor satisfies it.  However, the current system, by allowing
the appeal of Adminitrative Orders, can already handle this without losing
determinacy of holdings.  A TO honored by a Recordkeepor can be disputed under
R1809 and, if found to be in error, can be vacated by the court.  Before and
during the dispute, legal holdings correspond to the TO being honored.  If the
TO is subsequently vacated, then R1818 causes the TO to be reversed at the time
of vacation (or for a reversing PO to be issued).  Because of this, the
modifications I propose would give no more indeterminacy in Currency holdings
than the current system (provided I fix that business about when TOs must be
recorded).

Speaking as a Recordkeepor, the "added" burden of keeping track of who holds
what office (something I already do when processing Payment Orders) would be
worth the reduction in work by not having to match salary and reward TOs to
POs.

Proto: Simplify Currency Handling v 3

Tweaked TOs some more to handle some issues brought up by Scott (although
probably not to Scott's liking 8)).

Changes marked by '|' in left column.

===============================

Amend Rule 1661 by replacing the text "order the award of" with "pay out" and
by replacing all occurrences of "Payment Order" with "Transfer Order".

Amend Rule 1721/0 by appending the sentence "The Chancellor has Mint
Authority."

[I'm not sure this is really necessary, except that it may ensure the
continuity of Mint Authority for Currencies across Chancellor transitions and
avoid claims that all Currencies have been destroyed.  Better safe than sorry. 
Anybody think we need other changes to prevent Currency destruction when the
Chancellorship changes hands?]

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank" with
the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of
P-Notes are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1696 by replacing the text "The Mintor of VTs is the Bank" with the
text "The Mintor of VTs is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of VTs are
added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1846 by replacing the text "Their Mintor is the Bank" with the text
"Their Mintor is the Chancellor.  Newly created units of Ergs are added to the
Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.".

Amend Rule 1435 by replacing the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank"
with the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Chancellor.  Newly created
units of Indulgences are added to the Bank's holdings, any Rule to the contrary
notwithstanding.".

[Make the Chancellor the Mintor of all "official" Currencies, but make newly
minted units start out in possession of the Bank.]

Amend Rule 1817 to read as follows:

Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

|      A Recordkeepor is required to honor all valid Transfer Orders
       submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
       to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
       Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
       Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
       those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
       negative quantity of Currency, which are considered invalid.
|      Transfers shall be honored in the order in which they are received
|      by the Recordkeepor, unless the Transfer is disputed by CFJ prior
|      to being honored.  Such a disputed Transfer, if found valid by the
|      Courts, shall be honored as soon as possible after the Court
|      publishes its finding.

|      Whenever a valid Transfer Order naming the Bank as payor would 
       result in the Bank possessing a negative quantity of Currency, the
       Recordkeepor shall issue a Payment Order from the Bank for the
       same amount of Currency and to the same payee as specified in the
       Transfer Order.

[Changed this business of "noting" transfers on the record to "honoring" the
transfer.  This is more in keeping with the idea that "making a transfer as
ordered" is separate from merely writing down the results of that transfer. 
Also makes it easier to allow disputed TOs to be honored out of sequence, so we
don't have the kind of suspended game state uncertainty that results from a
disputed TO causing subsequent undisputed TOs from being processed.  Also, took
out the requirement to avoid honoring invalid Transfers.  The courts can
rectify that situation and Recordkeepors shouldn't be subject to Rule breaking
penalties for making honest mistakes.]

|Amend Rule 1819 by replacing the text "noting a transfer on the records of the
|Recordkeepor" with the text "honoring a transfer".

[Companion amendment to the previous - define what it means to "honor a
transfer".]

|Amend Rule 1820 to read as follows:

|Recording of Transfer Orders

|      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
|      filed with em which specify the Currency of which e is the
|      Recordkeepor.  This record shall also indicate, for each Order,
|      if that Order has been honored and if it is in dispute, or the
|      resolution of its dispute.  Honored Orders shall be noted on the
|      record in the order in which they were honored.  However, the
|      Recordkeepor need only maintain records of Orders for four weeks
|      after they have been honored or until four weeks after their
|      dispute has been resolved.

[Moved the requirement for report ordering here and made it more like the
Payment Order reporting, so everyone can see disputes and their resolution.]

Amend Rule 1470 by deleting the text "The Bank has Mint Authority".

[Mint Authority has been transferred to the Chancellor for the three "official"
Currencies, so the Bank no longer needs Mint Authority.]

Amend Rule 1735 by changing the Title to "The Chancellor's Banking Duties", by
deleting the text "The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.", by deleting
the text "(as the Bank's Executor)", and by deleting the entire last paragraph.

[The definition of "satisfy" for Payment Orders requires the Chancellor to
execute TOs for the Bank's POs.  Under this scheme, the Chancellor can no
longer commit Misappropriation because only TOs authorized by the Rules are
honored when the Bank is payor.]

Amend Rule 1479 by replacing the first occurrence of "Payment Order" with
"Transfer Order".

[Now anytime the Rules say "pay out", it means all the Player has to do is
issue a TO from the Bank to the payee.]

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text "and issue a Payment Order from the Bank
to that Player for one Indulgence" with the text "and pay out one Indulgence to
that Player".

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 1]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
          the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
          the reason therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1576 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1577 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1579 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the Clerk of
          the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owned a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
          an entity so desires.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred.  The units thus transferred will become the owner
      of the entity receiving them, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1722 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1734 be repealed.

Well, I would prefer to keep the Public Service Report separate from the
the P-Notes report if it is legal to do so. If it isn't I'll propose a 
change to make it so.

I think as things stand, you do have to include the PS Report with the
P-Note Report. Sorry 'bout that. (But what has this got to do with CFJ
1109?)

Is the Assessor required to report Infractions of Failing to Vote?

Could we have separate "Banks" for separate currencies, with different 
Executors?

Could we make the recordkeepor for a currency also the executor for the
Bank, for that currency? That would cut down the to-ing and fro-ing at
least a little bit. Currently we have things like: The assessor makes
Proposal reward POs, the Promotor records them, the Chancellor makes 
the TOs, the Promotor reports them. Why not cut this down to: The 
Assessor makes the POs, the Promotor fulfills and records them in one
fell swoop. This about halve recordkeeping, IMHO.

I guess so. The Rule says :

Rule 1863/0 (Power=1)
A Duty to Vote

      An Active Player who [fails to Vote] commits the Infraction of
      Failing to Vote, to be detected and reported by the Assessor.
      The penalty for commission of this Infraction is 1 VT.

As far as I am concerned, this means that the Assessor is not only
empowered, but also required, to report all such Infractions. We
used to have a Rule permitting the general public to report an
Infraction when the Player charged with doing so neglected eir duty,
which I think indicates that it is in the nature of a requirement.
Also, Officers charged with detecting particular Infractions should 
not be allowed to do so at their discretion, that would lead to a 
corrupt system. Wonder what happened to that Rule...
