Fair enough, 'intent' is the wrong word, but you're appealing to *something*
to support the idea that Rule 215 refers to your Nomic.  If Rule 215 said "New
Rishonomic" then you wouldn't need to appeal to anything; the reference would
be exact and would thus stand on its own.

Would it be an accurate summary of your view to say that "Rule 215 refers to
New Rishonomic because, at the time it was last amended (call it time T), the
only thing to which it could reasonably refer was New Rishonomic"?

If so, then I submit the viewpoint that the IN definition of "New Rishonnomic"
- and thus the effect of Rule 215 - has become ambiguous since time T.  Your
view seems to be that the definition and effect were fixed at time T, and that
a more explicit change (e.g. adding "New Rishonnomic does not refer to New
Rishonomic" to Rule 215) is required to change them.

At time T, there were two reasonable meanings of "ammend":
  1) "amend"
  2) meaningless; proposal has no effect
Obviously 1) has been chosen.  Analogously, at time T, the only reasonable
meaning of "New Rishonnomic" was the Nomic of which you are Speaker.  I am
less certain that that is still the only reasonable meaning.

Given that a choice was made to interpret 'ammend' as 'amend', Yes.

I submit that a change only a change of the rules can change the
interpretation of the rules, and since no such occured since time T, the
interpretation should stay fixed.

The Platonic view of nomic maintains that we are playing the closest
approximation of the interpretation of the rules rather than the rules.
Your uncertainty seems to imply that such a unilateral action, as creating
something which happens to be mentioned in the ruleset changes the
interpretation of the rules, or effectively, the rules as we play by them.

That should be a change in the rules, or a change according to the rules,
which I think also did not happen.

Very nice, Oerjan! But that first canto needs work. You've
mysteriously reversed the sequence of numbers with respect to the
original, and the meter is all wrong. I include the original
for reference:

      Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
         Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
      Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
         One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne,
      In the Land of Mordor where Shadows lie.

Back to the Lab! :)

Why wouldn't it fly? Because of R1698? I doubt it. I doubt that any 
amendment of the FR can fall foul of R1698 because of the very
good chance of the amendment being deleted before 4 weeks are over.
I think you missed a good chance to throw a Spaniard to the Turks.
Or something,
