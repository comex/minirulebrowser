Well, in fact the beginning of the next month restriction on
reregisration only applies to Players who deregister voluntarily, and
not to Players such as yourself who were deregistered via the
Abandonment mechanism (cf. R1042, R1043).

At any rate, welcome back!

Hm. This message appeared about 7 hours after Notary Swann placed
Proglet in Probate. I'm not sure this has ever happened before, and I
don't think the Rules really deal with this situation. A quick first
pass of the Probate and Executor Rules seems to me to indicate that
Proglet must remain in Probate until his Trustee, Murphy, announces 
that his Probate is complete. Am I wrong?

Unfortunately, majordomo does not yet have that functionality. Here's
what majordomo has to say about restricting posting:

 Restricting Posting
 ===================

 An easier alternative to moderation is to restrict who can post to the
 list, which can be done with the restrict_post configuration variable.
 The variable requires a file listing the people who can post.

 The most common case is to limit posting to people who are subscribed
 to the list.  This keeps out advertisements and other junk mail sent by
 non-subscribers.  Since majordomo already has a file of subscribers,
 you don't need to create and maintain a file, so it's easy to set.

 Change the restrict_post line to this, where <listname> is the name of
 your list:

 restrict_post = <listname>

 If you want to restrict posting to any other set of people, you'll need
 to ask majordomo-owner for help.  Unfortunately there's no way to tell
 majordomo about keeping another file of people who are allowed to post,
 so a file would have to be set in place "by hand".  Some future release
 of majordomo may provide a way to do this automatically.

Hm.  The maintainer of the trn mailing lists can do this, but then he is a
guru (TM).  Maybe he wrote his own listserver...

Incidentally, I see some of Murphy's messages got through recently.  What
they have in common is that they went through gecko's secondary mail
server (fw.serc) instead of directly.  This would tend to confirm my
suspicion that gecko itself is refusing email connection from
windowsnt.bayside.net.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

The number of POs is reduced. The Assessor must, of course, record all
votes and the prices to be paid for them. And under my proto e needs

H. Assessor,

I vote FOR.  This has never got off the ground and no one seems willing or
interested in fixing it.

>3805 Gen Chaos      1 Slam the Door

I vote AGAINST.  It might not be doing anything at the moment, and it's rules
may be a mess, but the concept of Internomic is a good one (I wish *I* had time
to participate).  Why start a new one, fixing a broken one can be fun too.  8)

That, or bayside's mail server is not properly respecting MX
priorities.  I never assume that Microsoft applications will behave in
a manner consistent with standards.  (Anyone using NT as a mail server
deserves what they get.)

This is correct, as far as I can tell.  However, as the only proper
Plan for Probate would be a plan doing nothing, Murphy should do so as
soon as the Rules permit him to do so.

I hate to be so nitpicky (or, to be honest, I don't really ;), but I'd
like to know whether people consider this to be valid, given that
R1478 states      

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

I always read this to imply that when I act on behalf of the Order
(being its Vizier and Executor) I must explicitly say so. Of course,
we can say that this is implicit in cases like Michaels TO above, and
that the provision of R1478 only requires explicit indications in
ambiguous cases. But I think that such an interpretation is not the
only way to read R1478, so it is more like game custom than what the
rule really says.

Protoproposal Chaos62 [rev. 1]

Executorship

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity. 
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.  
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player
            to be the Executor of that entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding. 

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

You probably just wasted your VTs. Plots are likely to be repealed before

I am in the process of making my Public Service proposal, to remove a 
couple of unnecessary ASAP clauses from the Promotor's duties. In the
process, I noticed that the ASAP defintion is really serving two quite
distinct and orthogonal purposes.

One is the natural meaning, that something must be done urgently. The 
other is more unusual. It indicates that the obligation in question 
continues indefinitely, until such time as it is fulfilled, and it 
enables Tardiness penalties to be imposed if the player in question
is taking too long about it.

Curiously enough, the first and more obvious meaning of urgency is not,
apparently, the most important definition. Most of us don't care whether
salaries are paid out as soon as possible after the beginning of the
week, as long as they are paid out sometime during the week. And if they
are not paid during the week, a punishment should be issued, and the
requirement to pay them should remain.

This is distinct from Officer's Reports, which it is important that 
they are made during the week, but if they are not, the requirement does
not persist. If I don't make a P-Note report this week, I will be penalised,
but it is not necessary that I make two reports next week.

I would really like to remove the notion of "as soon as possible" from
the ruleset. It implies an urgency about tasks which I don't think anyone
really cares about. Has anyone ever been punished for doing some actions
out of the order required by the first clause of R1023?

I also think we should more clearly codify "persistent" and "non-persistent"
obligations. Both kinds of obligations have a time limit in which they
ought to be fulfilled, and a punishment for failing to do so, but 
non-persistent obligations are ignored once the time-limit has expired,
whereas unfulfilled persistent obligations begin their time period anew,
with another penalty if this period also expires... and so on until the
obligation is fulfilled or cancelled.

I don't have much time to work this into a real proposal. It would involve
changing many of our rules. Is it worthwhile? Does anyone else have any
suggestion how this could best be done?

Protoproposal Chaos62 [rev. 2]

Executorship

|

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

|
      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules | to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was
          that entity. |
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor. |
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            specify either | a Player or a means to designate a Player
            to be the Executor of that | entity.
      (a) | | Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e
          must file | with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship. A
          Certificate of | Executorship must set out: |
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor; |
        (2) the Player's own name; and |
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that | entity.
      (a) | | The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates
          of | Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir
          weekly Report a | list of every entity not a Player which
          has an Executor, and the | Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with | em for that entity.
          | | A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when
          that person | ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the
          contrary notwithstanding. | | The determination by an
          Officer that a Player was not acting as the | Executor of an
          entity other than emself shall not be subject to | judicial
          review, in those cases where no Certificate of Executorship
          | has been filed with the Notary naming that Player as the
          Exector of | the entity in question. | | Any Player who
          files a false Certificate of Executorship commits a | Class
          B Crime. A Judge who determines that a Certificate of |
          Executorship was filed falsely shall Order the Notary to
          disregard | that filing. | | For the purpose of subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the holder | of any of the following
          positions shall be considered an | Officer when performing a
          duty required by or a privilege | permitted only by virtue
          of holding that position: |
        (1) the Speaker; |
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or |
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Yes, but not in a long time.

In general, I agree with the sentiments expressed in the remainder of
your message, mostly deleted here to conserve bandwidth.  If time
permits, I may attempt to develop the proposal suggested.

That can't quite be right. That the Rules specify a means to designate a
Player to be the Executor of an entity (say by giving the Notary the
power to do so), does not mean that the means have been used and an
Executor actually designated.

I'll support this. I originally introduced 10 day voting periods in
order to allow enough time for use of the long-defunct Powers to be
practical. Going back to a one week voting period now seems very
sensible, since the so much of the rest of the game runs on one week
cycles.

Executorship


Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player
            to be the Executor of that entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship. A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime. A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (z) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Currencies


Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit. When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule. This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information:
        (1) For each Currency, the designated denomination or
            denominations of that Currency (and if more than one, the
            relationship between them) and the fraction of the
            smallest such denomination which is the smallest
            indivisible unit; and
        (2) For each intangible Currency, the Recordkeepor and, if
            any, the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency". The "Recordkeeper" of
          an intangible Currency refers to the entity who has agreed
          to maintain a record of the ownership of the units of that
          Currency. The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules. Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (b) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors. A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred. The entity receiving the units thus transferred
      becomes their owner, and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on
      eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created. The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed. The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue. Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue. Late penalties are added to the overdue debt. An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest. A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner. Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof. Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is required to
          record every transfer for which e receives a transfer notice
          denominated in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor,
          when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (b) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor. (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as an intangible
          Currency. The sole designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the
          Bank. The Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably
          designated to be the Accountor. The smallest indivisible
          unit for this Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as an intangible
          Currency. The sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is
          the Bank. The Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably
          designated to be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as an intangible Currency.
          The sole designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank. The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1846 be amended to read:

      (a) Ergs are hereby designated as an intangible Currency. The
          sole designated Mintor of Ergs is the Bank. The Recordkeepor
          of Ergs is irrevocably designated to be the Cartographor.

      (b) The Cartographor constructively agrees to act as
          Recordkeepor for Ergs by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee. E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (z) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (z) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (z) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved. If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal
          existence prior to that time. An entity which has legal
          existence solely to this subdivision is called "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in
            Probate, along with all debts owed to the entity in
            Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity
            in Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate. Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
          how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
          the event that it becomes dissolute.

      (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
          the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
          bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary. The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
          time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
          the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the
          Notary, but a Trustee may determine, through examination of
          any relevant evidence found by or presented to em, that the
          entity of which e is Trustee had an unfiled Will superseding
          the Will filed with the Notary, and applying that Will
          instead.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit

          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage; and
        (3) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (z) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement. The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) If the Currency taxed is intangible, the Recordkeepor of the
          Currency named in a tax levy shall, as soon as possible
          after the announcement, provide a report setting out the
          amount of the taxed Currency held by every entity which held
          any units of that Currency at the time the announcement was
          made. The Recordkeepor is not required to compute the tax
          due; if e does so, eir computations do not have any legal
          force.

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

      (b) Each Voting Entity who votes on a Proposal is liable to a
          debt to the Voting Bank for a number of Voting Tokens equal
          to the votes cast by that entity on that proposal,
          multiplied by the voting cost of that Proposal. This debt is

I see your point.  However, note that the language you are commenting
to is exactly the language that presently exists.  Curious, eh?

Executorship

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
|           permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
|           of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
|           entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship. A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime. A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

|     (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 10]

Currencies

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has designated as
          a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible.

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit. When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule. This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information:
        (1) For each Currency, the designated denomination or
            denominations of that Currency (and if more than one, the
            relationship between them) and the fraction of the
            smallest such denomination which is the smallest
            indivisible unit; and
        (2) For each intangible Currency, the Recordkeepor and, if
            any, the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency". The "Recordkeeper" of
          an intangible Currency refers to the entity who has agreed
          to maintain a record of the ownership of the units of that
          Currency. The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is
          subject to the jurisdiction of these Rules. Specifically, e
          shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (b) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors. A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred. The entity receiving the units thus transferred
      becomes their owner, and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on
      eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created. The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed. The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue. Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue. Late penalties are added to the overdue debt. An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest. A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner. Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it
          to be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof. Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for the amount
          indicated, so long as the announcement sets for the reason
          therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is required to
          record every transfer for which e receives a transfer notice
          denominated in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor,
          when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (4) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
|         of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor. (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      (a) Voting Tokens are hereby designated as an intangible
          Currency. The sole designated Mintor of Voting Tokens is the
          Bank. The Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens is irrevocably
          designated to be the Accountor. The smallest indivisible
          unit for this Currency is 0.01 Voting Token.

      (b) The Accountor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Voting Tokens by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      (a) Proposal Notes are hereby designated as an intangible
          Currency. The sole designated Mintor of Proposal Notes is
          the Bank. The Recordkeepor of Proposal Notes is irrevocably
          designated to be the Promotor.

      (b) The Promotor constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor
          for Proposal Notes by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      (a) Indulgences are hereby designated as an intangible Currency.
          The sole designated Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank. The
          Recordkeepor of Indulgences is irrevocably designated to be
          the Herald.

      (b) The Herald constructively agrees to act as Recordkeepor for
          Indulgences by accepting the Office.

      (c) An entity which owes a debt (or debts) to the Bank for any
          number of Indulgences is said to have that number of Blots.
          A Player has Blots equal to the sum of all such debts. Debts
          which are in dispute are still considered when determining
          how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same
          number of Indulgences, naming that Player as the payor and
          the Bank as payee; this order shall be executed by whomever
          the Rules require to report the change in Blots.

      (e) A Player who has no debt in Indulgences to the Bank is
          Immaculate.

      (f) It is a Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or
          more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1846 be amended to read:

      (a) Ergs are hereby designated as an intangible Currency. The
          sole designated Mintor of Ergs is the Bank. The Recordkeepor
          of Ergs is irrevocably designated to be the Cartographor.

      (b) The Cartographor constructively agrees to act as
          Recordkeepor for Ergs by accepting the Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have a
          Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee. E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
|         (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved. If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code;
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate;
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it is
          dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have legal

          existence solely to this subdivision is called "terminal".

          Probate:

            the entity in Probate.

            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate. Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be

            Will.

            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth

          Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
          not inconsistent with the Rules.

      (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary. The Notary
          shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such

      (d) Neither the Notary nor the Trustee of an entity in Proabte
          is under any obligation to discover Wills not filed with the

          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement. The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
