Probate has little purpose anyway, given the present state of the economy.

All acts by the Trustee would be Without Objection.  Let the creditors
object - but I don't think any entity in Probate has ever had a creditor
other than the Bank, and why should the Bank care if it gets stiffed?

No, indeed, far from disagreeing with you, Crito, I should like to thank
you for your fine and penetrating analysis, which exposes a problem in
the Rules. It's not a problem which is easy to solve, however, for
solving it involves introducing new problems which are possibly as
difficult to solve as the ones just dealt with.

Basically, if we really want to relieve the RK of ever having to check
whether an entity is authorized to make a transfer, then we have to
allow the RK to accept all TOs as prima facie valid. This would mean
that someone who was not the Executor of the X Group could make a TO
transferring the Group's funds to themselves, and the RK would be
permitted to accept such a TO as having effect. Merely punishing such a
malefactor would not be sufficient; we'd have to develop mechanisms of
compensation for the wronged party, and it's not clear how such a
mechanism would operate and we could ensure that it did so justly.
