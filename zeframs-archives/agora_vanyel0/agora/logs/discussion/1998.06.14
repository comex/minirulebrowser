Could someone double-check this?  I was pretty sure I sent out

I think it is important to distinguish between two issues entwined
in Chuck's complaint. The first issue, on which I have some sympathy
for Chuck, is that of the relative levels of income generated by Plots
and holding Office. I still think Plots as currently legislated will
reintroduce VT inflation, which is why I voted against 'Plot Repair'
and why I want at the very least to see the Cartographor given
control over productivity of Plots in the same way as the Chancellor
now has control over the BOS.

The second issue is that of the absolute level of the BOS, and here I
think Chuck has got it wrong. If the Chancellor raises the BOS to 1.5,
as Chuck suggests he should if P3760 passes, the result will be the
immediate end of VT scarcity, and consquently, the failure of the
attempt to make VTs valuable by making thwem scarce. The BOS has been
set at its current level precisely because that level reflects the
trend in the VT-spending habits of Agorans. Chuck himself makes an
interesting example: despite earning a 2 VTs/week Salary for as long 
as anyone can remember, Chuck has cast only 2 votes in the last 11 weeks.
What he proposes to do with a 3 VT/week Salary I cannot imagine.

Of course, what votes Chuck casts or chooses not to cast is entirely
a matter for him. My point is that the correct response to
disproportionately high productivity rate for Plots relative to
holding Office is not to increase the BOS, but to decrease the
productivity of Plots.

But decrease it to what? Here I think Chuck touches on what may be a
fundamental problem with the Plots concept. I've argued at length
here that it is right and proper that we reward our Officers for the
work they do in contributing to the game, and making it possible for
the game to continue, by paying them in a way which increases their
influence over the game. The Plots legislation proposes to pay Players
(and only non-Officers if P3760 passes) at a similar level - but for 
doing what? Owning Plots simply cannot be compared in terms of 
commitment of time and energy to holding even a minor Office like that
of Wizard, let alone a major one like Assessor, Registrar, Accountor,
Promotor or Rulekeepor. If we pay Plot-owners anything like what we
pay Officers, for doing essentially nothing, then Chuck's question is
a good one: who'd be an Officer?

I can see only one way forward to save Plots: the Cartographor must
quickly be given the ability to control the productivty of Plots, and
once given the ability, must set that productivity level very low
relative to the BOS. Otherwise the political backlash from disgruntled
Officers, of which Chuck's post is an ominous harbinger, may be
catastrophic.

I seem to recall getting an SLR in that week but when I checked my archives

Rule 1598/6 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Zero is not a positive multiple of 0.1 (the MUQ of VTs), so the
foregoing are not valid Transfer Orders, effectuate no transfer, and
therefore (IMO) fail to satisfy Rule 1843's condition for the purchase
of a Plot.

I think perhaps I worded my complaint badly.  What I object to
is a situation where a non-Officer is likely to make more than
an officer.  One possible solution to this, if P3760 passes,
would be to raise the BOS.  I agree that this is not the most
desirable solution, as I agree with you that we should maintain
VT scarcity; but to me, that issue is secondary compared to
that of the relative incomes of Officers and non-Officers.

In other words, I, too, oppose VT inflation, but I see VT inflation
that favors Officers as a lesser evil than VT inflation which favors
non-Officers.

I should note that Ross' messages are being trapped by the listserver

Could you please quote the current text of R214 so that we may assess

We're essentially in agreement, then, it seems. The important question
as far as I am concerned is whether there is room in an economy of the
small size that Agora's currently is for a level of VT income intermediate
between holding Office and being unemployed. It's not at all clear to me
that there is, and if that's right, that seems to me a powerful argument
for getting rid of Plots altogether, or at least not making them productive
of VTs. But if we give the Cartographor control over Plot productivity,
we can try to settle the question empirically. The Cartographor will have
to see if there is a level of Plot productivity which is high enough to
make Plots attractive enough for people to want to own them, yet low
enough to satisfy both the demands of Officers that owning Plots not
be anywhere near as productive as holding Office, and the demands of those
who want to see VT scarcity maintained. And e will have to do this bearing
in mind that every increase in Plot productivity will have to mean a
decrease in the BOS if scarcity is to be maintained. A pretty political
pickle.

This was posted June 3. Has Judgement been entered? If not, a new

Does this mean that Plots cannot be purchased? Or only that they cannot
be purchased by executing a Transfer Order for 0 VTs?
