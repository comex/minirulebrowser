Note that none of the problems above apply in the other world being
considered for settlement by the Agoran community, the AgoraMOO.
There, power is only defined as 'physical' which currently reduces
to having programming or wizard permissions, and more than half of the
Agoran community is already installed on that world with that kind of
power, which means that the world effectively already belongs to
Agora. The 'gods' are ourselves.

I went on a guided tour in SW, i don't like it there.  My character
sux, it is crowded and confusing. I keep drying out even though i tried
to go up the tree. However, i find my self growing unexpectedly
attached to the AgoraMOO.   I like the programming aspect, and I think
we could do a lot with it.  Soon I will have may first objects to sell
if I can get them to compile.

I really don't think there is any point to working on embodying
ourselves in a world where we control the physics.  That's effectively
the case in AgoraMOO.  We control the physics of our existing (very
virtual world) as it is, and it is precisely this that I think we
should be moving away from.

I agree with this entirely.

In addition, I point out that SW offers us amazing potential for
_real_ internomic relations (not the sterile stuff that goes on in
Internomic).  I've also been assured by Delgath and others that the
"gods" of Shattered World are extremely unlikely to tamper with the
"physics" of the game so as to benefit either Nomic.

It is my opinion that we should pursue a "weak embedding" in which
Agora will take jurisdiction over some section of Shattered World,
using its existing parliamentary processes to establish rules for
conduct of (virtual) people within those areas where we have the means
to enforce our jurisdiction.  Initially, this area will probably be
quite small, and our means of enforcement rather meager.  But we can
hope to expand.

Initially, the only change for us as Players would be in the form of
Proposals to make laws and CFJs alleging that they have been broken,
and possibly in the creation of a new Office or two.  I do not propose
to require Agorans to participate in the MUD or to transfer any
existing aspect of Agora to the MUD.  If such requirements arise
later, they will do so because the Electorate deems them necessary.

We do and we don't. To the extent that the ultimate 'reality' of
AgoraMOO is under the control of persons, the Rules can control it to
exactly the same extent that they can control persons, i.e. not at
all unless there's a means of enforcement. 

We can hope to have the Rules be enforced in a MUD only to the extent
that we know that the persons controlling the MUD are willing to
abide by the Rules. In this respect there is no difference between
AgoraMOO and Shattered World, since both I and the SW wizards have
indicated willingness to do so. Actually, because the persons who
actually control SW are not Agorans, we will have fewer and weaker
means of enforcement there than we would in AgoraMOO.

The main difference between Shattered World and AgoraMOO is that
there is currently more 'physics' in SW to provide for some acts
that we might be tempted to regulate. This however won't stay the
case, as more participants to AgoraMOO provide code that lets people
'do' interesting 'stuff'.

But conversely, because the 'physics' of SW already regulate a lot of
things, there'll be less incentive to legislate; and because of the
situation of the Agoran community there, I expect the main focus of
activity to be on diplomatic relations with Sanom City, the main area
of SW, rather than on legislative activity regulating individual's
actions.

Scott added :

We might offer other Nomics some space on AgoraMOO and derive exactly
the same benefit from that. It would hurt my pride somewhat if Agora,
the 'oldest and largest' Nomic, were to have its virtual world
subordinate to that of smaller game. ;)

Then why not, from the start, choose a world where the means of
enforcement exist and expanson would be easier ? In addition, some
of us already feel SW's 'physics' to be constricting and too RPG
inspired. AgoraMOO doesn't suffer from such disadvantages, and the
'physics' that eventually build there can be set up to suits the
particular needs of our community.

Of course, as I've mentioned, nothing prevents us from inhabiting
both worlds. We can have a Rule Category for Merenth (the place in
Shattered World we're going to settle) and one for AgoraMOO, and
pass Rules regulating both places. Watching how either world gives
rise to different legislative activities can also be an interesting
experiment.

Which is far more boring, if you ask me. I regard these things as
challenges, not as discouragements.

I think you underestimate the time and effort it take to produce
a MUD that "does interesting stuff". SW has been running for, I believe,
five years or more. It is all very easy to build one or two little
"trinkets" like I have done, but to build a large and interesting 
world (which is more than just a gliorified chat-room), takes a long
time and a lot of effort. Do not count on my help. I have a PhD
to do, and a life to live. I do not want to be sucked into that 
whirlpool. 

If SW is too "RPG'ish", then what kind of world are you imagining?

I can't underscore this enough.  It takes years to make a rich

because the implementor is not even a Player.
