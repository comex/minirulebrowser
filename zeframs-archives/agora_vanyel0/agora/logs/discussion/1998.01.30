I am afraid this Proposal, if adopted, would not have the intended
effect, as the starting phrase "A Rule will be enacted with the text...",
or somesuch, is lacking.

I change my vote for INP 361 to FOR.
<<

Thanks a lot for trying. Of course, I'd like to see you vote for this,
but I'm afraid you can't anymore. This is not a vote on an Agora
proposal (where votes can be retracted) but a standard referendum
governed by 1434. This rule includes the point

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

As I said, I'm sorry about this myself, but on the other hand it is
always fun to discover new details in the rules, isn't it?

You can't.  There is no provision for changing votes in a Referendum.

After realizing what you were doing, I was sort of nervous that you had
sent the Voting Report immediately after, so I found it best to hurry. :-)

It occured to me afterwards that if I had stated in the message the actual
purpose of the transfer, we would have had a paradox :-)

Well, this is rather irritating.  Here I am, with two minutes to go
until I could have gotten ChrisM out of probate, and now I have to
come up with some Plan for a measly six Indulgences.  Argggh!

I would like to point out a serious problem here.  This new rule
clearly removes all Voting Tokens from the game -- those of the
Players, the inactive Players, the Organizations... and the Bank!

I demand, therefore, if it hasn't occured yet, that the Bank's VT supply be
reduced to zero.

Thus, the Chancellor can't transfer five Voting Tokens apiece to each Player,
because the Bank can't be payor for it.

Unless I misunderstand, we're broke!  And we can't even vote in a new
Proposal to remedy the situation!

Thus, I humbly declare a Paradox, or at least a unfixable state of the
game.

Well, it does if you play the Humility last.  If the Humility is already in 
play, and then your opponent casts Empyrial Armor, then the creature gets big. 
 It's sort of the reverse of Agoran precedence -- if two cards (rules) 
directly conflict, the newer one (highest number rule) will win.  Sort of.  ;)

Yes, that was definitely one where we could have swapped messages between the 
two mailing lists, with just a few minor tweaks, and had them fit equally 
well.  In Magic, we ended up changing the rules to fix the problem, explictly 
ruling that you don't stop and recalculate in the middle of an event and that 
a spell forms a single event unless it contains the word "then."  Agora 
decided not to do such a fix, so it's still a little ambiguous just what the 
atomic level of game-state changes is.

Yes, they are.  The Proposal destroyed _all_ Voting Tokens, not merely

Not at all.  The Bank has the unlimited power to mint new VTs under
its authority as Mintor of VTs, and will in all likelihood do so
promptly, so as to satisfy its assorted debts and obligations.

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

> Thus, I humbly declare a Paradox, or at least a unfixable state of the

Even without Rule 1471, we would have

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

and

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

As I and Scott have explained, the paradox was false alarm in this case.

It should also be mentioned (for later occasions) that we Agorans have
taken a Pragmatic attitude to paradoxes.  Even if a part of the Rules
should become self-contradictory, we do not consider that to affect the
remainder.

The interpretation of Rule 101 is a weird issue in itself; note the
annotations in the Full Logical Ruleset.

But can this be done retroactively?  My point was that the new rule
cannot be fulfilled; something was passed into effect that was an
impossible action.  Or are you saying it is possible to pass a rule,
fulfill only half of it and then come back and fulfill the second half
after some modifications have been made?  Sounds half-baked to me.

All right, then--do you agree that the new Rule seemingly makes it
impossible to vote on new Proposals?  (By removing all Voting Tokens
from Players and falsely saying that the Bank can pay them more.)  
If so, then isn't the new Rule nullified by these rules?

Um, the Rule says that the transfers should be done "as soon as possible",
which is a Rule-defined term (one which some Players unfortunately object
loudly to capitalizing), basically meaning within a week.

Also, there is a big difference (as in, we use to have long philosophical
debates about it) between a Rule saying that something happens
automatically, and a Rule placing an obligation on a Player. These
transfers are of the latter type.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Ah, I think I just realized what you are misunderstanding.  You seem to
think that the transfers should happen immediately after the Rule is
created.  That's what would have happened in the old days, before last
July.  (Although at that time the Bank was allowed to go negative so there
was no problem then either.)

However, one of the basic tenets of Scott's Pragmatic Currency System,
passed last July, is that Currency transfers now only happen when some
Player makes a Transfer Order.

So when the Bank shall transfer currencies, that means that the Executor
of the Bank shall make a Transfer Order.

(The Bank's Executor is the Chancellor, which is currently Scott.)

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Not true.  The Chancellor, acting as the Executor of the Bank, may
create an unlimited number of Voting Tokens under the authority of
Rule 1722.  Thus, the Chancellor has 7 days from the adoption of
Proposal 3674 to mint a sufficient number of Voting Tokens and issue
the required Payment Orders.

Even if the remedy described above did not exist, Agora could yet
continue: Rule 114 prohibits the implementation of any change to the
game state which would render it static, and Rule 1698 prohibits the
implementation of any change to the game state which would make the
adoption of Proposals completely impossible for a period of four weeks
or longer.  It is effectively impossible to inadvertently crash Agora.

Read the rule more closely.  All existing VTs were destroyed at the
time the Rule was created.  This occured immediately.  The Bank is
further required to execute Transfer Orders _as soon as possible_
after the creation of the Rule.  "As soon as possible" is a term of
law (see Rule 1023), and basically amounts to "within 7 days".  This
gives me (in my role as Chancellor, the Executor of the Bank) plenty
of time to perform the necessary minting action before I would be in
breach of the newly created Rule.
