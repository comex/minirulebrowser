"Entity Class" is itself an Entity Class, and contains itself.  What's
uncomfortable about that?

'A Public Voting Experiment' also has a minor bug in it, I notice,
which I'll propose to amend if it passes: it says nothing about
declarations of Presence.

What if he had said: "I hereby execute a Transfer Order etc". Would
that male a difference as far as you are are concerned?

But surely the point of R1586 is to prevent different *classes* of
entities from having the same name? I'm prepared to accept the
reading of R1586, elaborated below, under which that Rule does not
imply that every instance has a name (quite sensible). But then
we should regard R1586 as referring to class names, not instance names.
But then, what of Players? 

I'm not fond of R1586, either.

I don't know; some people seem to think so. I have a vague
recollection of some discussion which would have had to presuppose
that the two were in existence simultaneously as some point, but
perhaps my memory is mistaken.

Archivist Vanyel, can you resolve this?

Here's my opinion: you are obliged to obey the Rules currently in
effect. Your report was made after P3533 took effect, at which point
R947/11 was also in effect. So you have to obey R947/11. The fact that
R947/11 makes reference to the state of things prior to its adoption
makes no difference. So I think you are required to submit a Payment
Order for 3 P-Notes from the Bank to G. Chaos.

Damn, I always vote too early :) Morendil, I've already voted for Blob,

Actually, I'm not sure that would work either - for a given message
to be a Transfer Order it has to contain an "order", i.e. language
whereby you require - ask - someone to do something, namely to
record a transfer that you are effecting. So to say "I hereby
execute a TO" means "I hereby post to the PF a requirement of
the RK of Currency X to note some transfer". It seems to me that
such language is descriptive rather than prescriptive, and I don't
quite see how a sentence that is merely a description can be an
"order".

Correction: the adoption of P3533 cannot cause you to come to be
required make a Payment Order since that provision only came into
effect after P3533 was adopted, and hence would be a retroactive
effect. So I agree with Scott: the transfer occurs under the aegis of
R947/10, but you are not required to report it.

What of players indeed?  Why can't R1586 apply both to classes of
entities *and* to individual entities?  See, this is one of the
nice things about the interpretation that a class of entities
is also an entity itself.

I'm not particularly fond of the proto floating around to
distinguish entities from classes of entities, as I utterly
fail to see any need to make such a distinction.

I thought I saw a reference somewhere that there
is was a CFJ that determined Players where *not*
Nomic Entities.  So the reference to Players seems
to be an addendum to the list of things that are
required to have separate names.  This might leave
you free to interpret the name restriction to
class names for Nomic Entities.  Definitely a lot
of built in ambiguity to R1586.  8)

But what, then, of individual organizations?

Here, in a nutshell, is my opinion on the situation:

Currently, classes of entities are also entities in
themselves.  I would prefer it to be kept this way, and
I see no need to make a formal distinction.

"named" is to be interpreted narrowly.  Neither "called"
nor "known as" are synonymous with "named" (that "known
as" is not synonymous with "named" is supported by the judge's
opinion in CFJ 803.)  Many entities do not have names.
Among these are the Transfer Orders and Payment Orders of PC
(both the individual orders, and classes as well).  Thus, there
is no conflict with these and the Misanthropists' currencies.
This, also, I see no need to change.

There are *some* problems with 1586.  Its definition of NEs
is ambiguous and should be clarified to mean "any entity that
would cease to exist if Agora ceased to exist" or something
similar (although even this could be problematic, seeing as
how the FRC continued to exist when Nomic World ceased to 
exist.  OTOH, it could be argued that FRC did cease to exist
at that point, and it was re-created by an extra-game agreement.)
Also, 1586 should be changed so the proscription on names also
applies to player nicknames without erroneously implying that
Players are NEs.  But *not* player names.  If some other person
named Charles Edward Carroll (I have estimated, very roughly, that
there are about a dozen of us in the United States) wishes to play,
e should be able to without having to change eir name first.

Applications, proposals, and other such entities should be
redefined (if they are not so defined already; I haven't actually
checked the rules) to be entities which have *associated* with them
a body of text, rather than *being* a body of text.  Thus making
it clear that they, too, are NEs.

But what, then, of individual organizations?

Here, in a nutshell, is my opinion on the situation:

Currently, classes of entities are also entities in
themselves.  I would prefer it to be kept this way, and
I see no need to make a formal distinction.

"named" is to be interpreted narrowly.  Neither "called"
nor "known as" are synonymous with "named" (that "known
as" is not synonymous with "named" is supported by the judge's
opinion in CFJ 803.)  Many entities do not have names.
Among these are the Transfer Orders and Payment Orders of PC
(both the individual orders, and classes as well).  Thus, there
is no conflict with these and the Misanthropists' currencies.
This, also, I see no need to change.

There are *some* problems with 1586.  Its definition of NEs
is ambiguous and should be clarified to mean "any entity that
would cease to exist if Agora ceased to exist" or something
similar (although even this could be problematic, seeing as
how the FRC continued to exist when Nomic World ceased to 
exist.  OTOH, it could be argued that FRC did cease to exist
at that point, and it was re-created by an extra-game agreement.)
Also, 1586 should be changed so the proscription on names also
applies to player nicknames without erroneously implying that
Players are NEs.  But *not* player names.  If some other person
named Charles Edward Carroll (I have estimated, very roughly, that
there are about a dozen of us in the United States) wishes to play,
e should be able to without having to change eir name first.

Applications, proposals, and other such entities should be
redefined (if they are not so defined already; I haven't actually
checked the rules) to be entities which have *associated* with them
a body of text, rather than *being* a body of text.  Thus making
it clear that they, too, are NEs.
