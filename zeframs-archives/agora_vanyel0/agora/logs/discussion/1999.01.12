Not an Election, a filling according to the Order of Succession.

Also, would the Speaker please notice that an Election for the Office of

Since the Election results haven't been announced yet, I guess that is

8 does seem surprisingly low. Wear it as a red badge of courage.

Nevertheless, it would be interesting to test the truth of that
statement by providing a summary of all the Kudo transfers that Players
have made to or from you, including the reasons, in the last couple of
years. 

Does anyone have archives of all the Herald's Reports going back several
years?

"Hardly any relevance"... hmph! We Agorans have long memories when it
comes to traitors... ;)

PS: Do we perhaps want to modify the Honour system so that Kudos 
naturally settle back to some median value over time? I'm not sure 
it would be a good thing, but it's worth considering.

I was going to say that. Producing VTs and P-Notes is non-trivial. 
Generally it means a certain amount of real work, either as an Officer
doing Recordkeeping in the case of VTs, or in making interesting Proposals 
and getting them passed (without spending too much in the process), in 
the case of P-Notes. Gaining Indulgences is, I admit, a hit-and miss thing, 
which I think could do with a little more added subtlety.

So, I suppose you could say the natural resources we have are the 
players' time, creativity and ingenuity.

I agree with that, but it is early days yet. When we tried jumping in
the deep end, creating a complex economy in one fell swoop, it was a mess.
With time we can develop this.

Can you tell me more about this game? Is it a board game, a computer game
or what? Where can I find it?

I'd like to add an unofficial annotation to R693 based on the
Judgements of CFJs 1110 and 1111 (regarding the end of the VP for
P3810-3812); however, since this had so many varied opinions in
discussion, I wanted to solicit comments on a draft before doing so:

[CFJ 1110 (Judged Dec. 11 1998; Appeal completed Dec. 22 1998) &
 CFJ 1111 (Judged Dec. 22 1998): When the voting period of a proposal
 whose voting period is in progress is changed via amendment of this
 Rule, a vote is valid if it was cast after the start of the voting
 period and prior to its end, those times being determined by the
 text of this Rule at the time the vote is cast.]

Comments?
