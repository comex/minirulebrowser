No indeed.  I instead save it by stating that it is in fact random.
The argument dismissed in CFJ 790 is the one that states: "So what if
the distribution of ingredients on the boxes isn't quite perfect; the
method was still chosen randomly."  This isn't an issue here, because
it seems that the distribution of DJIA is suitably random.

What did Rule 1652--Double Jeopardy--have to do with Permanent Electioneering?

I don't think I have misunderstood the import of the test.  It can't
prove random-ness.  However it is as good as it is possible to get for
any putative source of random numbers.  If I had used my computer's
built in random-number generator, I can only support my claim that it
is random by showing that it gives the right sort of distribution of
numbers.  You seem to be asking more of me with the DJIA method than
you would ever ask for other methods. 

My standard technique to make random number choices is to use a random
number generator that comes as part of the bash shell.  This doesn't
get special dispensation from R1079 as do dice and coins, so it is
beholden to all that use them to demonstrate randomness.  How else
would they do this except by using techniques such as chi-square
tests? 

Michael.

Seems to you, perhaps.  But there is no consensus on that issue.

Randomness can be proved (well, not absolutely, but within a
certain confidence level) by chi-square tests, but not by
the method you suggest.

A chi-square test can be used to test a distribution against
any predicted distribution, not necessarily an even one.
Suppose, for example, we are testing a coin to see if it
is fair.  Testing the coin against the desired 50-50 distribution,
as I pointed out before, proves nothing if the test is favorable.

However, let us suppose we have agreed on what is an acceptable
tolerance from the ideal 50-50 probability.  Perhaps we have
agreed that any bias greater than or equal to 52-48 is unacceptable,
and any lesser bias is.  Let us then perform a chi-square test
of the coin's results, not against a predicted 50-50 distribution,
but against a 52-48 distribution.  If it fails that, then
we have proved (to a certain confidence level) that the coin
is not biased by a 52-48 probability.  If the actual results
were less biased than 52-48, and it fails a chi-square test
against a 52-48 distribution, I would consider that proof
that it was fair.  To be more precise, if the actual
distribution of results *fails* a chi-square test against
all *unacceptable* probabilities, we can be fairly certain
that the actual probability is fair.

To address your point that I am requiring more proof
of a DJIA method than I do of the bash random number
generator: yes, I am.  That is because I feel fairly
certain--on a purely intuitive level--that the bash
random number generator is fair.  Perhaps I am wrong.
But nothing in the rules requires me to challenge
any method of random selection.  I have chosen to
challenge the DJIA method.  (And judging from discussion
on the issue, I'm not the only one who questions this
method.)  Perhaps it's not fair that I challenge this
method but not the bash random number generator, but
I am not required to be fair.

If memory serves, Risky Rebellion was introduced before Electees. I say
that because getting Risky Rebellion adopted was actually a small part
of the Officer Veto scam, whereas the Electee reform arose out of that
scam and so must have come later.

Even though successive Cals for Revolt are quite legal, it remains a
hypothetical issue. Only *effective* Calls for Revolt require the
Registrar to make a determination, and there can only be one effective
Call for Revolt in any week. See R1664.

I know I don't have the relevant statistical expertise. If no-one else
does either, then you cannot use the method. It's worth pointing out
that legally it's up to you to prove your method is fair - no-one else
is required to help you. Although I'd be pretty disgusted with anyone
who could help you but refused to do so. (On the other hand, maybe that
would be a legitimate strategy for someone who wanted the Revolt to
succeed, and therefore desired you to reroll...)

Again, modulo the worries about the DJIA itself. I agree with Michael
that if the DJIA mod 17 is random, then his method in this case is fair.
I also believe that it could be modified into a policy that could
produce random numbers, although getting the details right might be more
trouble than it was worth.

No, I think use of the Courts was appropriate in this case.

Ack. That was, of course, suppose to be R1625, Secrecy of Votes.

Really? I thought we were still waiting for the chi-square test results.
Have thse been posted? Or are you now guessing from the armchair what
the results will be?

By the way, what degree of confidence in the outcome of the test would
you regard as acceptable? 95%? 99%? 99.5%? 99.9%? 99.99999%?

A chi-square test against the desired probabilities proves nothing,
if successful.

One possible response: since you are using one selection to make two
choices, the correct way of describing the possible outcomes is that
there are 4: AC, AD, BC and BD. Flipping a single coin once cannot
distribute probability equally among 4 outcomes, so the method is not
fair.

Oh jeez, I looked it up in my Stats book and there are tests for
randomness.  Looking at it makes me wonder how I found this class so
easy.  What exactly is the hypothesis we want to test? That the Closing
Dow modulo 17 is Random?

True, but it will provide a confidence level that the method is random,
and that's all we need. All we have to do then is to use commonsense to
come to some agreement on what "reasonably close to equal" means in
R1079.

If the results of the chi-square test on Michael's data were that we can
be 99.5% confident that the numbers were generated from a random source,
then I think we could agree that this satisfied R1079's requirements
that the distribution of probability of among the possible outcomes be
reasonably close to equal.

I guess so. But don't take my remark above to mean that I expect you to
to teach yourself how to use chi-square tests if you don't already know.
I was thinking more that someone might have a program handy to perform
the test, but refuse to make it available to Michael for tactical
reasons.

No, you're wrong Steve. The Officer Veto Scam was before Risky Rebellion.
So it was probably my fault if the Rebellion rules are broken in this
way, although I was sure I kept all the appropriate phrasing from the
previous version. Nevermind. Shall I propose the fix?

While I'm at it, is it worth trying to fix the loophole wrt changing
your Rebelliousness between the CfR and the resolution? I can't see how 
it could be of any significant tactical advantage to change from Abiding 
to Rebellious during this time (if you are going to Rebel, you might as
well do it before the CfR and increase your chances of winning), but 
it might be worth quickly changing from Rebellious to Abiding if you
suspect the Revolt is going to fail, and you want to get out of harms
way.

There is an easy fix to this: when a CfR is made, all Rebellious players
become Revolting. At the time of resolution, only Revolting players are
rewarded/punished. Players cannot change to/from Revolting in any other
way, so they are stuck with this status until the resolution is made. At
which point they either return to being Rebellious (if it failed) or 
Abiding (if it succeeded).

Of course, then the Inciting to Revolt rule might also need to be 
changed. Is this worthwhile?

So when should we expect the Double Jeopardy scam? :)

According to my Dad, who has written statistics textbooks,

chi-squared = Sum of {(fo-fe)^2/fe}

where

fo = observed frequency
fe = expected frequency

The total number of observations is 25771, so fe = 25771/17 = 1515.9214

    fo          (fo-fe)^2/fe

0:  1357	16.6644
1:  1401	 8.7150
2:  1491	 0.4103
3:  1392	10.1333
4:  1397	 9.3322
5:  1459	 2.1388
6:  1401	 8.7150
7:  1556	 1.0586
8:  1494	 0.3176
9:  1511	 0.0161
10: 1646	11.1583
11: 1588	 3.4252
12: 1631	 8.7329
13: 1778	45.3018
14: 1763	40.2641
15: 1456	 2.3701
16: 1450	 2.8683

         Sum:  171.6220

For the hypothesis that Michael's data could have been produced by an
equiprobable model with 16 degrees of freedom, and for a significance
level of 0.01, the chi-squared table gives a value of 32. That is to
say, if the chi-squared value had been 32, there would have been only a
1-in-100 chance that the data were produced by a fair 17-sided die. For
a chi-squared value of nearly 172, that 1-in-100 chance vanishes into
insignificance. We can be as certain as we can be of just about anything
that Michael's data were not produced by a fair 17-sided die.

Why should this be so? Michael used the closing day figures for DJIA for
each trading day this century. So we should ask the question: what is
the average change in the DJIA on a day-to-day basis? If it is much
larger than 17, then we could expect the DJIA mod 17 to be randomly
distributed. On the other hand, if the average daily change in the DJIA
were much smaller than 17, we should not expect the DJIA mod 17 to be
randomly distributed. Why not? Well, say the average daily change were 4
points, and a particular closing day's figure mod 17 was 9. Then we
should expect the next day's closing figure to be distributed around 9,
not randomly distributed.

Now, I don't know what the average daily change in the DJIA has been
during the century, but I can guarantee that it has increased enormously
in the last 10 years. For nearly the whole of this century, the value of
the DJIA has been less than 2000 points. The DJIA did not close above
2000 points for the first time until 08 Jan 1987 (Source: Standard &
Poors; Bloomberg Financial Markets). For much of the century, the DJIA
has probably had values of 1000 points or less. So, for much of the
century, the average daily change in the DJIA has almost certainly been
much less than 17, which accounts for the extraordinarily high chi-square
value.

The DJIA crossed 6000 for the first time on 14 Oct. 1996. Perhaps since
that time, the average daily change in the DJIA has been larger than 17
points. Perhaps a chi-squared test on the figures from that period would
show a better result. Personally, I doubt it. In any case, I think this
whole exercise has been useful in showing the foolhardiness of relying
on the DJIA as a random number generator. I hope that Michael will now
give up and use the dice server or some other demonstrably fair method.
