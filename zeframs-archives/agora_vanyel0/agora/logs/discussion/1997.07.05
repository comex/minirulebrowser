I'd offer to, but I think it might be a little hypocritical to
have a majority of players on the Undemocratic Movement. :)

Even with the smiley, I'll comment: the means do not need to be justified.
The DM is not saying that unity votes are dishonourable, just that they'd
like the game better without them.

Now there's a pretty puzzle. If the game started out democratic, and 
evolved into what we have today, surely that means that the democratic
choice of the people is to reject democracy. In which case, those who 
support democracy must support the people's decision, and also reject
democracy, no?
