Ah, I've figured it out. I was getting confused between P3685 (Block
successive Revolts), which was adopted on Feb 12. and was a small part
of the Officer's Veto scam, and P3713 (Risky Rebellion) which was
adopted on Mar 19.

Please do. Someone ought to make some Proposals around here.

Too true. What's causing this current slump, do you think? Have we 
finally attained the mythical "perfect ruleset"? :)

Yeah sure.  I say "seems" precisely because the relevant tests haven't
been performed.  However, as you yourself say in another post, it
should be possible to test for acceptable degrees of random-ness.  I
put this proviso in one of my posts, and hoped that people would
understand it to be present in all of my other posts.  

To reiterate, I claim that: 

Modulo worries about the distribution of DJIA values not being fairly
distributed, my method of random determination is fair and random.
The fact that I chose an existing value, and then further confused
people by talking about what I would do if I needed another random
number in the future is irrelevant.

Michael.

Well, once you have over a ~ a 60% chance of succeeding, I don't know
that it's really that risky.  If you only pick up 2 Blots a head,
(plus an extra two for the Caller), this is only going to encourage
you to try Rebelling in the next week.  And the average number of
CfR's required for success is well under two.

How much does the value usually change from day to day?  If it is much
more than 17, it might not be so bad.

I have about 140 transfer orders and their effects calculated.
Many more PO's recorded.
I have a question about the rules.  Someone made a transfer order and
did not have the funds, a few days later the bank made transfer orders
and then there was enough VT's to cover it.  Over all the player has
enough to cover all eir TO's.  Can I just delay the TO's a day or 2 and
then do the transfer, or is the transfer automatically invalid.

The chi-squared analysis shows most emphatically that over the course of
the century, the DJIA mod 17 has not been a random number generator. If
Michael is prepared to provide a smaller subset of that data for
analysis, it might show (although, as I say, I doubt it), that the Dow
mod 17 has been a random number generator in more recent periods, say,
over the last 12 months. Of course, even that wouldn't prove that the
Dow mod 17 is a random number generator *now*.

Curiously, I can find nothing in the Rules which says that a Transfer
Order for an amount of Currency greater than that possessed by the
transferring Player is in any way invalid. Nor can I find any
instructions on how such TOs are to be treated. Perhaps I haven't looked
hard enough?

On a related topic, you should note that a consequence of the Judgement
of CFJ 1100 is that all Private Transfer Orders not sent directly to you
are invalid (but you probably knew that, since you were the original
Judge of that CFJ). We need to do something about this Judgement: either
recalculate the gamestate or ratify some Reports.

When I made that remark, I had no idea how quickly the Rebellion
bandwagon would gain momentum. I thought there would be 5 Rebels at
most.

I think that lee technically probably is guilty of Dereliction of Duty,
even though he hasn't been an Electee for 3 weeks. However, although
I've been saying lately that I want to see Crimes and Infractions
reported when they are committed, I'd be inclined in this case to use
the discretion R1644 gives you not to report him, and cut lee a little
slack, for a number of reasons. Firstly, lee inherited a messy situation
from Blob; secondly, this is his first time in Office; and thirdly,
removing him from Office when he claims to be close to producing a
Report is likely to delay even further the publication of the Report.

These are the rules, i still don't know what to do.
Rule 1598/7 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.  If a Transfer Order
      purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order and either that
      Payment Order does not exist or cannot be satisfied by the
      Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is invalid.

Rule 1817/0 (Power=1)
Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Rule 1730/1 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency may, at eir discretion, elect to
      refuse any Transfer Order which requires em to note a transfer
      at any time other than as soon as possible after the Order
      itself became effective.  The Recordkeepor's election to refuse
      an Transfer Order in this fashion renders invalid that Order
      provided that the Recordkeepor sends a message to the Player who
      executed the Order informing him of eir election, within seven
      days of the receipt of that Order.

      This Rule does not apply to Transfer Orders which are required
      by the Rules to be executed with a specification that the
      transfer be noted at a time other than as soon as possible after
      they become effective.

You subsequently posted a message reporting some, but not all, of the
consequences of the successful Revolt. In particular, you haven't posted
a Notice of Speaker Transition.

OK. You can ignore the Delayed TO Rule (1730) - it's not relevant here.
R1817 contains the key instruction: you are not required to note the
effects of TOs which result in the transferring Player possessing a
negative amount of Currency. Just ignore the TO.

Can you tell me which my attempted TOs failed due to insufficient funds?

I don't argue at this point i am probably guilt of dereliction of duty.
 I don't concede it either. I Haven't had time to thoroughly look at
the rules:-)  I do ask for mercy if that is what i need.  I have it all
calculated, pending a decision of what to do about a few transactions.
I am at the point of moving the satisfied PO's to the satisfied PO area
and then saving the report to text. And posting it of course.

I have had to restart a couple of times and had some other quite
farcical setbacks in all this.

Which means that the new version of Rebellion is working just as I
hoped it would. Yay!

An interesting question. R1837 (The Miscreant) states that:

      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Rebellious Players
      when determining the outcome of a Revolt. 

while R1664 (Rebellion) states that:

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

The question is whether a person that counts as two Rebellious Players
must necessarily also count as two Players. Seems to me that a Judge
could reasonably decide this either way.

CotC Michael? When are you going to distribute lee's 2 CFJs?

I note that with the removal of these 4 Offices, Salaries totalling 5
BOS/week have been removed from the economy. This may give the
Chancellor scope to raise the BOS from 0.4 to 0.5 VTs, although if I
were him I'd want to get a look at lee's VT Report before making any
decision about that.

The Registrar should also update his Report accordingly.
