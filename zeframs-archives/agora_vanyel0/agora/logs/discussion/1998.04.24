I think we ought to remove the requirement for a referendum on every
Internomic propossal, and empower the Ambassador to vote as e sees fit,
in the knowledge that e holds an elected position, and that e can be
impeached if e misuses eir power. The current system is too slow, and
poor Kolja has to spend all his time drumming up votes in order to
achieve quorum.

This hinges on an important issue in politics. When we have an indirect
democracy, we have to choose someone to defend our interests as a group.
We can either choose to have a delegate, who can only act according to
our direct orders, or a representative, who can act as e sees fit, 
according to our general wishes. Representatives are generally reagrded
as more flexible and efficient, but also more risky than delegates.
This is an area of politics which I think it would be interesting for
us to explore. I'll write a proto soon.
