But it didn't.  Which makes me wonder whether an appropriate Transfer
Order has been executed yet.  What does it really take nowadays to make a 
Transfer Order?

I now see that things are rather sensible:  The Omnibus reform introduced
the ability to amend an Order, which I believe the above does reasonably
amount to.

But this should clearly be a trivial typo under R754. Let's not make
things more complicated than they are. The confusion about the typo in
P3710* comes from the fact that this is about a proposal, for which
absolute exactness is required. But TOs and, in fact, all other
documents except proposals, are immune to typos.

Hm, I wonder who wrote the above?

Please don't confuse the general issue by referring to irrelevant facts. 
Assume that Blot is an old, respectable Player from the southern part of
Alabama, known for his strange sense of humor and weird spelling.  He has
two dogs, five children, and a small dwindling business and still
miraculously finds time to play Nomic.  In fact, some suspect that he is
using Agora as an escape route from Real Life, although he ardently claims
that things are going just fine and in fact he's just hit upon a great
offer to advertise his business on the Internet, so it will soon be going
even better.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

That would be my interpretation.  One of the goals of the Omnibus
Reform was to make it easier to recover from minor (or even major)
errors in issuing Orders.  The prior regime required judicial
intervention in most cases.
