This is _not_ my official judgement on this CFJ, but a version (or
actually two alternative versions) which I present to you for feedback
and discussion.

1. History 
==========

of the order in question (if this reconstruction is wrong, well,
sorry, but at least I tried.)

        explicitly permit em to issue such an Order. If e has made an
        Order that does not conform to these criteria, e must vacate it
        within 72 hours.


2. Were these amendments effective?
===================================

[This is the conventional version of my judgement]

I don't see a problem with the first amendment. 


2.1. Changing an order's target 

Macross argued in a mail to a-d that the second amendment was
ineffective because it didn't only change the text of the order, but
also the player the order was directed to.

While I agree that the possibility to change, by amendment, the entity
an order is directed at is an unpleasant and possibly couterintuitive
one, this aesthetic consideration says nothing about the legality of
such changes (the possibility to vacate TOs after they have been
satisfied is ugly, too, but still it's there).

The rules don't explicitly define or limit the scope of order
amendments. While the entity issuing an order is determined by fact,
not by the choice of the entity issuing the order, the entity the
order is directed to is determined by the choice of the entity issuing
the order. Therefore I'm not convinced that the last amendment of the
order was ineffective because it tried to change the target of the
order. 


2.2. Did the amended order fit the definition of an order?

Orders are defined in 1793 as 

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may be argued that the underlined text should be parsed
interpreting the "or" as an "exclusive or". I am not sure this is true
- the sentence also makes sense with an "inclusive or". E.g., an order
of the form "I order player XY to transfer 5 VTs to me, or to refrain
from actions A, B and C" seems to me to fit the definition in 1793.

However, the final version of the order had the form "I order Macross
to refrain from actions A, B, etc, _and_ to perform action X" where X
is "vacate any orders already made and against the provisions in this
order within 72 hours." So it did not fit the definition of 1793. As
an amended order has
                                                  effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      amendment becomes effective.
(1793) and the amended want-to-be-order was not a valid order, after
all, I think as an end result the original order _was_ amended, but
this amendment resulted in it becoming a non-order, with no legal
effects. 

Therefore the statement of this CFJ is true.


3. Are changes to orders possible?
==================================

[This is an alternative judgement, based on a more fundamental
argument.]

The amendment of an order according to 1799 "is done by an Order to
Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order."

So in order to reconstruct the amendments of the order in question, we
must identify the Orders to Amend that caused the amendments to
occur. 

However, I'm not sure such Orders to Amend can exist under the present
definition of 1793,

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

What is the entity an Order to Amend is directed to? And what is the
Action required in the Order? That the order to be amended change
itself? But an order is a command - how can commands change
themselves? 

Therefore, due to a bug in the order amendment rules, amendments of
orders are currently impossible, and the abovementioned amendments
never occurred, so the statement of this CFJ is true.

[I admit that this is a slightly weird argument, and against the spirit
of the Orders rules. But I still have a suspicion that with the
current system Orders are unamendable, just as they would be if, say,
Amendments had to be performed by the Amendor, an officer not defined
anywhere in the Agora rules, or by a proposal adopted with a voting
index of pi (while proposals are defined by the rules, they can never
have an irrational, but finite voting index). 

Oh well, I guess the simple response is to answer "The Order to be
amended", "yes" and "yes" to the questions in the last paragraph but
one above.]

I think this argument completely ignores the third paragraph of Rule
1793:

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Order, the purpose of which is
      to affect the operation of a prior Order, is as valid as any
      other Order, and is said to be directed at the prior Order it
      affects.

It's quite clear to me that this means that Orders to Amend do not
need to be directed at any Player, or require any Action.

This is, IMO, much more palatable than disallowing this kind of move
from having legal effect.

In most cases, I would think that it could be simply the Officer
required to note the action(s) in question.  This might result in
more than one officer interpreting a multi-action message, but I don't
think that is a problem, even if the Officers make differing
determinations. . .  All that is required is that the Officer's
determinations rule in the case of unclear conditionslas so there's no
backtrackking.

A CFJ on this might actually make law Chuck's suggestion that the
Officer's determination in such cases shall rule.  I would think that
would be the most reasonable interpretation.

The other two interpretations I see:

1) It doesn't happen because the truth of the conditional is
inderterminate at this time.

2) It is deferrered until the conjecture is proven :)

That actually seems a pretty reasonable precondition to me.

outright bribe :)

I simply want to address a point which I think is important to the
conideration of this CFJ:

Regardless of the form of the Order in question, it was presumtivly
valid under the Rules until a CFJ (such as the one being argued now) has
adjudicated it invalid.

Now if Macross had simply posted eir Order, without the precondition "if
this is legal" e would in fact have issued it, and a ruling of invalid
would be a defence againt any future accusation of criminal activity.

However, e _did_ provide the precondition in a quite obvious attempt to
avoid commiting a Crime if eir conjecture about the legality of the
Order upon eim was in error.  However, because the way Orders happen to
be structured, the Order to Macross is in fact valid and binding up
until the point the CFJ finds it invalid.

Therefore, because of the presumptive validity of the Order on Macross,
the act of making the Plindrome Order was not legal at the time e was
making it, and therefore-- since he made "legality" a precondition of
making that Order-- e did not in fact make the Palindrome Order.

AFAICT, this argument is true regardless of the validity of the Order
upon Macross, since such validity is not permitted to actually impair an
Order's effect until a CFJ is called and ruled upon.

That, in a nutshell, is why I believe my subsequent actions were legal.

I think it would be preferable to legislate to allow an Officer to 
ignore a message requiring them to make determinations of fact
not within their province.

It has not yet been proven, but that certainly does not mean it
is indeterminate. The conjecture is either true or false; it seems
likely to me that it is provable, until and unless it is proven to be 
unprovable, of coures.

> 2) It is deferrered until the conjecture is proven :)

I would think Game Custom in previous instances is to the contrary.
Such Moves have been considered to take effect at the time they were

Thank you, Crito, for this clear statement of your position. However,
it seems to me that Macross' argument is not so much about the
_validity_ of your order in its amended form. E seems to me to be
asking whether after the amendment your want-to-be order _was_ still
an order or not.

My proto judgement does not deal with the question whether the amended
order "was an order, but happened to violate any regulations for
orders", but with whether it was an order at all. And if it wasn't, it
also had no legal effect on Macross' actions.

Your point about the validity of an order, which remains until it is
proven invalid by a CFJ, would apply, say, to an order that tries to 
hinder its own appeal in violation of the requirements of 1796; but in
my current understanding it is irrelevant re. CFJ1097.

What do you think?

Actually, that was Swann, not me.  I haven't had time to look at the Rules
closely enough yet, so I am not really sure if the presumption of validity
applies to incorrectly formed orders or not.  Although I suspect Kolja's
interpretation is correct - if it was not in the accepted form of an order then
it was not an order and presumption of validity does not apply.

My response would be seeing as this implies that the RFC usage
is not the normal English usage, I'd prefer to stick with the
normal English, even when it's ambiguous.  Of course, we could
incorporate our own form of the RFC into the Rules, if we wanted
to.

There's a longstanding rule of statutory interpretation in the United
States that "shall" means "may" if interpreting it as "shall" creates
a conflict with the Constitution.  I think this is even noted in
Black's. :)

That's great!  8)  Here's my interpretation.  Since determination of the truth
of the above conditional is beyond my meager intellectual capacity, I cannot
make the above transfer until and unless someone provides a proof of the
conjecture.  The Rules do not specify a time frame within which a Transfer
Order must be satisfied.  Therefore, the three VTs stay where they are and no
score change occurs.

To finish pragmatising it is, I think, important. At the moment, 
there are some large loopholes in the transfer rules. But the task is
rather a major one, and I haven't had time to sit down and work it
out from scratch.

This is more elegant than my idea. If it works (which I haven't checked)
then I would support it.

Indeed I did. 3 free Plots seemed to be overgenerous to me, 
especially when you also get 30 Ergs startup money. If everybody
takes their free Plots and builds on them, we're going to have
oversupply in no time.

The point is that the Cartographor is the Executor of the Crown, 
and not the Chancellor. Basically, I think the Cartogrpahor should
be in charge of the whole Plots thing.

Hsm. We'll see how it goes.

The point was to keep the two mechanisms independant, in order to
create some sort of interplay. If players want Officer/Entrepreneur
incomes to be roughly equivalent, then they should use political 
pressures to get the BOS and MF set appropriately.

I have no idea what a good supply of P-notes is at the moment, so
I left this one as-is.

Are you sure? I wrote this because I found a number of bugs in 3753.

Goldbach's conjecture belongs to a class of conjectures (previously
including Fermat's conjecture) which cannot be proven unprovable, since if
they are unprovable they are true. 

So, if it is unprovable we will never know.

This is patently false.  I had no concern as to whether your Order was
valid.  I said in my message that I held it to be invalid and gave my
reasons why.  My concern was whether the Palindrome Order itself would be a
crime.  There had been talk of penalties on the issuers of such Orders and I
didn't want to issue the Order unless the Rules allowed such Orders.  In my
opinion the recent CFJ on the validity of such Orders resolves the question
of whether or not I issued the Palindrome Order.

In my opinion, it can be argued (and has been, I believe) that crimes in
Agora are not illegal.  In Agora, a crime is simply an action or lack
thereof for which one must pay a penalty.

I realized that I don't have to prove that I actually issued the Order, I
just have to convince the Judge that I did.  So I started thinking of as
many different arguments as I could, figuring I could make several and hope
the Judge agreed with one enough to Judge true.  This is just the second of
several arguments I might try out (the first was submitted with the CFJ).

Only if you are a platonist about mathematics. A constructionist
or intuitionist would say that the conjecture indeed is not true
or false prior to our having come to some determination to that
effect.

I trust Oerjan will now be suitably outraged. :)

IMO, conditional moves are not supported in the rules. If you say you 
do something, you do it; otherwise you don't. How officers interpret 
"conditional" moves is up to them. Of course, there is longstanding 
game custom against me, but hey.

Two questions: is there a proof that Goldbach's Conjecture cannot
be proven to be unprovable? If not, then, on what basis do you claim
that the Conjecture cannot be be proven to be unprovable?

Secondly: what is 'provability'? Could it be the case that the
Conjecture is false, but cannot be proven to be false?

I'm ccing this to you, Scott.

The 3 Proposals I have currently have up for vote are: P3756 (No
Presence), P3757 (A Secret Voting Experiment), and P3758 (Permit
Electioneering!). All three Proposals are 2 month trials, with
built in sunset clauses. The first two are both aimed at increasing
VT expenditure by encouraging Players to vote FOR Proposals
they like and AGAINST Proposals they do not like. Getting rid of
Presence means that at least 5 Players will have to spend VTs
in order for a Proposal to pass. Making voting secret will mean 
that Players will not automatically be able to tell how a Proposal
is doing and use that information to optimize their VT expenditure.
(They will still be able to do this to a certain extent if they go to
the trouble of polling the other Players about their votes, or their
intentions). Permitting Electioneering is not aimed at the economy,
but seemed a nice companion to a A Secret Voting Experiment, and in
line with our recent practice of finding new powers for Officers.

Heh.  Nobody has managed to prove that Goldbach's is either provable
or unprovable, nor has anyone proven that the foregoing is either
provable or unprovable.  (You can stack metatheory indefinitely, but
it gets confusing after more than two metas.)  My wife is convinced
that it's unprovable, but I think that's because that outcome would
lead to the most consternation for mathematicians (since that result
would create a theory bifurcation on Goldberg's Axiom, much as the
proof that Cantor's Hypothesis is unprovable created non-Cantorian set
theories) rather than any grounded mathematical belief.  (I believe
most mathematicians believe that Goldbach's is probably true.)

You know, I think you're right.  For example, Rule 1808 (quoted in part):

      Administrative Orders are executed by being published in the
      Public Forum, and take effect upon publication.

This doesn't say that an Administrative Order can be "conditionally
executed" by qualifying the publication of the Order in the Public
Forum.  Nor does it require a Player to state that e is executing an
Order in order to do so; publishing it is enough.  I would suppose
that this means that the conditional language--at least in the case of
Administrative Orders (and, by analogy, all other Orders)--is
irrelevant and ignored, as far as the Rules are concerned.  Perhaps
Oerjan can tell us the Latin equivalent of "Speaker Beware" :)

I'm less clear whether conditional language applies to Voting, since
the statutory language is less clear: 

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. 

It could be argued that conditions included on the message would play
a role in determining whether or not the message "informs the Assessor
of the vote or votes [the voter] is casting".

Of course, lots of other communications have effect on the Game; each
one would have to be examined in detail to determine whether or not it
can be conditioned, in the current statutory regime.  Proper wording
of the Rules can--and, IMO, should--prohibit conditioning, of course.
