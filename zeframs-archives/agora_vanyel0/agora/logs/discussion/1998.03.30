Sounds intriguing, but I don't understnad every second word in that
paragraph. Could you please explain "common law", "civil law", 
"judicial lawmaking" and "_state decisis_ jurisprudence"?

Well, it's not a very daring suggestion. :-P My main reaction is: why?
We're not trying to create a Points economy here, after all. There's
no suggestion that Points scarcity is a thing to be desired, nor are
points tradable commodities. The Scoring Rule seems to be working OK
since it was enacted, so why reset Scores?

And what about a conflict between 2 Rules, neither of which has a Number?

This is a classic illustration of the reasons for not selecting 
Appeal Board Justices randomly. Since the same Justices will hear
the Appeal for both Judgements (assuming that they are appealed),
one can presume that contradictory Appeal Judgements will not be
delivered.

Only indirectly, by removing the ability which Players currently have

I have some reservations about this myself, but I don't think it's
that much of a concern. After all, we have just reduced Quorum from
effectively half of the Players to a third. So Quorum will not be
so difficult to reach. Really it would be an experiment: one might
even introduce it with an explicit sunset clause, set to expire after,
say, 6 weeks or 2 months. The problem as I identify it is that total
VT incomes are still greater than expenditures (contra your point that
the measures make it unaffordable to adopt Proposals). The point of the 
suggestion is that it stimulates expenditures by raising the cost
of passing Proposals. As you point out, this might not work: it might
turn out that no-one was prepared to pay such a cost, and that therefore
all Proposals would fail Quorum. Indeed, some such problems can be
anticipated early on (although I doubt that all Proposals would
fail). Soon after that, though, I would expect Players to adapt to
the new conditions, particularly as frustration with the miserliness
of Players and inability to get legislation adopted grew amongst
those making Proposals and trying to get them passed. I would expect
Proposers to react by lobbying harder to get the vote out. Again, I
could be wrong: Proposers might not care enough to bother.

I think a more cogent criticism of the suggestion is its conservatism.
It would make it hard to get a Proposal adopted without the exercise
of some political muscle, which might mean that some of our more
whimsical Proposals would find it hard to garner Quorum.

In Nomic, as in life, timing is everything.

I have a couple of reactions to this suggestion, which I have considered
before (and even tried before, in Nomic World). Firstly, a note on
terminology. You talk about creation and destruction of VTs where I
would talk instead about VTs entering and leaving circulation. As I
use the terms, VTs are only created when the Chancellor mints them,
and as long as there are VTs in the Bank, the Chancellor can pay
Official Salaries without minting new VTs. This usage is reflected
in the Rules.

Still, your proposal for a taxation system to ensure that the number
of VTs entering and leaving circulation is equal or roughly equal
is clear enough. Nevertheless, I'm against it. I'll try to explain
why. Imagine that we adopt your suggestion as the solution to the
input/output imbalance. The result is that Officers are paid Salaries
until the Bank runs up againast the limit of VTs in existence (which
you have set at 10 or 15 per Player). By hypothesis, inputs continue
to exceed outputs (ignoring the effect of taxation), so after that,
tax will have be levied to pay for Official Salaries and the like.
Assume a flat tax levied on all Players. Obviously, the richer
Players with incomes (ie the Officers) will pay more than those
without incomes, which is fair enough. After several levies, the end
result is that those without incomes have no money at all and so pay
no tax, while the Officers are paying taxes purely to raise funds so
that they can be paid their Salaries. But what is the point of giving
with one hand while taking with the other in this fashion? All you've
managed to do is to create a whole bunch of extra paperwork, without
adding any interest to the game. (This is what happened in Nomic
World.)

One might object that this extra paperwork is the same as the
paperwork generated by my Proposals to stimulate VT expenditure.
After all, if those Proposals work, then the VTs will be getting back
to the Bank somehow, and these transfers must all be recorded. That's
true enough, but it ignores the means by which the VTs are getting
back to the Bank. Having VTs return to the Bank as the result of
Player-initiated decisions to spend funds to obtain the political
results they desire is, I argue, intrinsically more interesting than
the mechanistic levying of taxes. This is at bottom why I have been
pursuing the strategy of trying to bring input and outputs into a
natural balance rather than a forced one.

However, I can see a possible role for a kind of taxation system,
although motivated differently to your suggestion. It might be
interesting to give the Chancellor the power to levy taxes at eir
discretion. If the Bank ran out of VT to pay Salaries, the Chancellor
would then have the option either of increasing the money supply by
minting new VTs to pay the Salaries (as e is currently compelled to do),
or of restricting the money supply by levying a tax. But I'd like to
see the input/output imbalance problem solved first, so that the
Chancellor would only face such decisions occasionally, as the result
of natural variations, rather than every week.

Here's another idea: set the Basic Officer Salary at a fraction of
VT expenditures to the Bank in the previous week. I wonder what
effects that would have?

I'm reasonably happy with this. I note, however, that that part of
Proto can and should be removed if 'Tabula Rasa' is proposed and
adopted, since it deals with same things, more comprehensively
(ie it includes Indulgences).

My search engine for the Rules is now functional, if a little
rough.  It can be found at:

http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/search.html

It is less than ideal at the moment, but useable.  Some
features which it does not have, but ought to, and will
be added as I have time (along with revisions of my
other Agora pages):
* Results are displayed as a table, which don't line
  up in browsers that don't handle tables completely
  (e.g., Lynx).  Add a link to a non-table list of results.
* Add navigation buttons.
* Currently, from the list of Rules returned in a search,
  only one Rule can be displayed at a time.  Add a link
  to display the text of all Rules returned on a single page.

As always, keep in mind that these pages are not updated
instantaneously with Rule changes.  If you are not certain
whether a given set of Rule changes has been incorporated
into the web Rules, look at the "last updated" date on
the main Rules page,

http://www.dfw.net/~ccarroll/agora/rules/

Also, once you see a Ruleset published in the PF incorporating
a given set of Rule changes, those changes are necessarily
available in the web Rules.

I have in the back of my mind, once this is done, the idea
for a major revision of the Categorized Rule Lists.  (I took
a course in indexing last fall, and knowing what I know now
I could do a much better job on those.)  However, this is
a *major* project, so do not expect to see it any time soon.

No, but R1802 does say that the effect of vacating an order is to
permanently deny that order from having any effect, presumably including
the effect of satisfying a payment order. So in that case, the original
payment order for VTs would remain unsatisfied.

The trouble seems to me to come in some cases where a transfer order
is executed, 'voluntarily' as it were, ie not pursuant to any payment
order. I transfer VTs to Blob, he spends them, then I vacate the transfer.
Now R1818 says that if Blob has insufficient funds to return to me the
VTs I transferred to him, he cops a payment order which he has then
to find some way to meet. This seems to me grossly unfair to Blob, who
should be able to spend VTs transferred to him without worrying about
this kind of thing. Frankly, I don't really see why such transfer orders
should even be vacatable. Can Scott or anyone else provide a
justification for this?

Can someone please point me to the rule which says that proposals must
achieve quorum in order to pass? I don't seem to be able to find it.

Also, wrt R1761, does the proposal have to be in its voting period 
when the Speaker posts eir _intent_ to waive Quorum or when e 
actually waives Quorum, 4 to 14 days later, or both?

I think this analysis is mistaken. Ultimately, the issue comes down to
this: if I inherit an Office for which there is an Official Report, 
and no Report for that Office has yet been posted to the Public Forum
by the prior holder of that Office, is a new obligation created on me
to post the Report for that Office before the end of the week, or do
I inherit the obligation incurred by the prior holder of the Office?

If the obligation is inherited, then R1585 governs and I have a whole
week from the time I assume the Office to post the Report. If the
obligation is new, then R1686 governs and I have to post the Report
before the end of the week in which I came to hold the Office.

If I understand Michael correctly, he believes that the obligation
is new and that R1686 therefore governs. I disagree. I think the
obligation is inherited. For if the prior holder of the Office *had*
posted the Official Report for that Office before I inherited it,
then we would not say, and have not said, that R1686 imposed upon me
a new obligation to post a second Report before the end of the week. 
That is, it is game custom to interpret 'Officer' in R1686 as referring
to the position and not the Player holding it; the requirement is that
each week a Scorekeepor's Report be produced by some or other Player
acting as Scorekeepor, not that every Player in a week who acts as
Scorekeepor produce a Report. That being so, the obligation to
produce a Report must be inherited from the prior holder of the Office
who did not discharge it. R1585 therefore governs, taking precedence
over R1686.

Perhaps Michael will accept my argument and correct his Infraction
Report. If not, a CFJ would seem to be warranted.

Rule 106/0 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.

But you're right to bring this matter to our attention. R106 actually
conflicts with R955, a conflict between Power 3 Rules which R106 wins
by virtue of lower Number, a quite unsatisfactory arrangement for such
an important set of provisions. Probably the provisions in R955 should
be moved into R106 and R955 repealed.

>Also, wrt R1761, does the proposal have to be in its voting period

I looked at this the other day and concluded that in order for
Quorum to be waived, the Speaker must actually Waive Quorum, as
distinct from merely announcing eir intention to do so, while the VP
is underway. See Rule 1728 (Actions Without Objection).

This does not preclude, in my opinion, the Speaker's announcing eir
intention to Waive Qurom before the VP gets underway, which it would
be perfectly possible to do now that we have the Proposal Queue and
the Sepaker can identify what Proposals are coming up before they are
distributed.

I think there was a CFJ that established a precedent for Michael's 
view. I'll look it up.

I'm a little surprised to see Steve apparently adopt a position on 
the subject opposite to what e advocated as Judge of this CFJ; but 
perhaps I've missed something, either in Rules that were amended 
since that Judgement, or in Steve's argument. I'll look again in 
time allows; meanwhile, here's 1061, quite relevant to the issue at
hand :

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1061

   Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
 installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to
 Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts
 the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
      General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, 
      Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Morendil (not a player)
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     
Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686
Injunctions: See below

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 29 Oct 1997 17:11:54 +0100
  Assigned to Steve, 30 Oct 1997 14:49:06 +0100 (MET)
  Judged TRUE by Steve, 2 Nov 1997 14:10:44 +1100 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week".
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that the
Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the new
Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it in
attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least once a
week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction,
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player,
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In the matter of CFJ 1061, I judge that the Statement is TRUE. The
Caller's arguments are persuasive.

I believe it was Crito who suggested that the Statement might be
trivially false because a Player newly installed into Office might
violate ASAP by posting eir Report out of order, even though within
the week. But Morendil's rebuttal is incisive: in that case, the
Player would be guilty of Tardiness, but not of Failure to Report.

======================================================================

Injunctions:

Firstly, I hereby grant Morendil's request for an Injunction to
Annotate, and enjoin the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1585 with the
Statement and the list of Relevant Rules.

Secondly, and as required by R1504, I hereby issue an Injunction
enjoining the Clerk of the Courts to vacate the Payment Orders,
executed by then- Registrar Zefram in his 'Salary Report 1997-W43',
penalizing Kolja and Steve for Failure to Report.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Well, if the Appesl Board is going to hear one, it may as well hear
the other at the same time. I therefore Appeal the Judgement of CFJ
1089 so that Blob and Scott's arguments in the matter may be considered
by the Appeals Board. It should be understood that I don't necessarily
accept the arguments.

Interesting. Let's look closely at the argument which you made, and I
accepted, in CFJ 1061:

>======================================================================

First point to notice: you argued here, as I just have to Michael,
that the duty to Report is inherited by the incoming Officer, not
generated anew, and governed by R1585, not R1686.

Second point: the acceptance of this inheritance picture implies that
such a duty is *not* inherited if the prior holder of the Office already
discharged the duty for that week before the Officer transition. If the
duty has already been discharged, then there is nothing to inherit.

It therefore seems to me that my positions last November and now are
completely in accord. I'm not quite sure why you think I've
backflipped. Perhaps it is because of the remarks in your argument
about the holder of an Office being the target of the Infraction, not
the Office, whereas I've just argued to Michael that R1686 imposes a
requirement that each week a Scorekeepor's Report be published by
some Player who is the Scorekeepor, not that each week a Scorekeepor's 
Report be published by every Player who is Scorekeepor. But your
remarks then and mine now are not in contradiction with each other.

Indeed. I strongly support Scott's position on this, as I find the
alternative almost unbearably Platonic. I find the idea that the Proposal
wasn't adopted almost completely unintuitive. It's quite obvious to
everyone that something differing by only one character from the proposal
sent to the Promotor was indeed distributed. It might make some sort of
formal sense to say that this is not the Proposal at all, I suppose, but
running this game by that sort of logic will simply make it an exercise in
tedium for all involved as we second-guess every action we take over issues
as minute as this.

You haven't; I merely misread the recent exchange between you and
Michael. It seems to me that 1061 is the Game Custom you were citing
in your reply, in fact. Rather than CFJ on the issue, should Michael
decide not to accept that interpretation, e should instead Appeal 1061.

Actually, believe it or not, I had completely forgotten about CFJ 1061
when I was replying to Michael. The game custom I was thinking of was
more to do with the fact that no-one has ever suggested that a newly
installed Officer assuming an Office in a week in which the prior holder
of the Officer has already Reported, nevertheless incurs a duty to make
a second Report.

I just found the following remarks made by Chuck in his Appellate

Given Chuck's new interpretation of R594, can we take it that he is
now a convert to the sequential model discussed exhaustively in
connection with CFJ 933?

Didn't we recently adopt 'Buying Points' ? If so, it might be argued
that a high Score represents an equivalent value in other Currencies. 
A Player with a high Score will have less of an incentive to buy 
Points, hence an imbalance with respect to the 'blank slate' state 
that Tabula Rasa attempts to set up.

I'll tackle these out of order.  In a "civil law" system, dispute
resolution is governed by a comprehensive body of statutory law
enacted by a sovereign ruler or other lawmaking body.  In theory,
judges need only find an appropriate match between the instant dispute
and the civil code, and then apply the civil code to the dispute.  The
classic example of a civil law system is the Napoleonic code.  Civil
law systems predominate in continental Europe.  It is worth noting
that until recently in most civil law systems, it was not normal to
cite precedent.

Opposite to this is the "common law" system practiced in England and
her former colonies.  In a common law system, disputes are resolved by
principles of fairness; the parties plea before the judge and the
judge resolves the dispute in whatever manner he feels is most fair.
The judge's decision is expected to be consistent with his prior
decisions, however, and those of his predecessors and judicial
colleagues.  (Originally, the judge was the King or the King's
representative, which is why I referenced Fascist.)  Because the judge
resolves the dispute based on principles of fairness and on precedent,
rather than a legislated code (as in a civil law system), the "law" in
such a system is effectively written by the judges; hence the term
"judicial lawmaking."

"_Stare decisis_ jurisprudence" is simply the expectation in a common
law system that a judge will rule consistent with his prior
decisions.  (Attorneys insist on this.)

I wondered if anyone would bring that up. :-P

My lead is not massive. It is substantial, I suppose, but not
insurmoutable. I don't know why I have it, to be honest. I'm not
consciously trying to maximize my Score. In any case, I'd be arguing
the same way if my Score were negative. 

Care to make a substantial argument rather than an ad hominem one?
I promise not to try and discredit it by pointing out that since
your Score is low, you could only be motivated to make such an
argument by a desire to see Scores reset. :)

It's true I had forgotten about R1790, but that scarcely affects my
argument. In the first place, since the great majority of Points are
not gained by buying them with Currency (in fact, there hasn't been
a single transaction of this type yet), and since Points are not
convertible into Currencies, it's simply false to say that high Score
represents in any way an equivalent value in other Currencies. There's
basically no link between them. 

Secondly, I think you are mistaken that a Player with a high Score
will have less incentive to buy Points. A Player close to winning
may well spend Currencies to buy the Points needed to win he game.

Thirdly, even if you were correct that a Player with a high Score
would have less incentive to buy Points, I think it's drawing a very
long bow indeed to suggest that we should worry about this being a
cause of imbalance in the economy. Any effect that this might have
would be tiny, and completely dwarfed by the effects of other forms
of expenditure such as the cost of voting.

I reiterate: the point of Tabula Rasa is to impose scarcity in the
three tradable Currencies we've set up: VTs, P-Notes and Indulgences.
Points are not tradable Currencies and so simply do not belong there.

Heh.  Actually, at this point I am not too concerned one way or the
other.  I suspect that my time in Agora will be dramatically limited
for the next several years, as I am due to shortly begin the process
of shifting toward professional participation in a much larger
Nomic. :)

Perhaps we should review the concept of Quorum altogether.
With the possibility of waiving Quorum and Quorum buyback,
Quorum no longer serves its original purpose--to prevent
a fairly small number of people from passing proposals
when most players, are, say, on vacation.

Now if we don't want Quorum to do this, but still wish
to keep it simply as an interesting game mechanism,
that's fine, but my inclination (although not a
strong one) is to say that if we're not going to
let Quorum serve its purpose, maybe we should get
rid of it altogether.

Two characters.

I'll let the courts decide the matter of what the current situation
is, but as for the question of what is desirable:

Someone (Swann, I assume, although I'm not sure) paid good
P-Notes to increase the priority of P3710.  Doesn't e deserve
to have the Proposal distributed as e believed e was raising
the priority of?  Isn't it rather unfair that eir P-Notes
were supporting something other than what e thought they
were supporting?

No, because the Game Custom of Null-Amendments prior
to the adoption of the current form of R594 still
stands, and I believe that if R594 did not say
that inapplicable provisions were ignored, Null-Amendments
would still be applied.

The next published FLR will not record those Null-Amendments
which were previously recorded that took place after
the adoption of the current form of R594; those which
took place before it will remain.

Consequential damage of the Promotor's error.  If we had tort law,
whoever it was (I don't recall either) could file a tort claim against
the Promotor to recover his/her loss.  But we don't have tort law.  Oh
well.

I note that we consider an Officer to have published eir required
Report, and not punish em for failing to do so, even if eir Report is
defective.  The same nitpicky attitude that leads to the conclusion
that Proposal 3710 has not been distributed also leads to the
conclusion that an Officer's Report containing errors is not really
the true Report, and that the Officer in question should be subject to
sanction for failing to Report as if e had not Reported at all.

Of course, this all boils down to the general problem with Platonism:
it cannot reasonably cope with errors.

It has long been conceded that extreme Platonism cannot reasonably
cope with errors, just as extreme Pragmatism cannot reasonably
cope with deliberate abuse.

I disagree. A Report's contents are not essential to the fact that a
Report has been published; if it is found that an Officer published
a Report that is erroneous or incomplete, and did so with intent,
that Officer is subject to TIA penalties.

I do not consider these two cases to be the same at all.  The report is
generated de novo by the Officer.  Even if it contains errors, it *is* the
report.  The distribution by the Promotor is of a piece of text that e received
from another Player (in most cases).  If the Promotor distributes a piece of
text that is different from the one given to em, it is also reasonable to
consider that e did not distribute what *was* given to em, even if the changes
are very minor.

Would you, then, be in disagreement with the following?

A Proposal's contents are not essential to the fact that a Proposal
has been published; if it is found that the Promotor published a
Proposal that is erroneous or incomplete, and did so with intent, the
Promotor is subject to TIA penalties.

I define extreme Pragmatism to mean that reports of the game
state are universally considered as correct without question.
I do not mean to suggest that any Player currently supports
extreme Pragmatism.  (Just as I hope you are not suggesting
that just because some of us oppose a Proposal-with-a-typo
being a real Proposal, we are supporting extreme Platonism.)

Granted that we have had more instances of error than
deliberate abuse.  That does not mean we can ignore the
potential for deliberate abuse.

I dispute the validity of characterizing extreme Pragmatism to mean
"reports of the game state are correct without question"; that would
be "Officerism."  I think extreme Pragmatism is best characterized as
"the game state is whatever the Players say it is."  Officerism (in
which the Players agree to allow an Officer to speak for them) is
merely one flavor of it.

I also note that extreme Pragmatism admits the option of revolt,
something that I believe is inconsistent with extreme Platonism.
Gross malfeasance under extreme (or garden variety, for that matter)
Pragmatism is resolvable through revolution.  An extreme Platonist
cannot admit revolt as an option unless it is specifically provided
for in the Rules (which, as far as I am concerned, is a
contradiction).

I said that reports of the game state are universally considered
as correct without question.  Not just *offical* reports.

>I also note that extreme Pragmatism admits the option of revolt,
>something that I believe is inconsistent with extreme Platonism.
>Gross malfeasance under extreme (or garden variety, for that matter)

You are right--extreme Platonism does not admit the possibility
of within-game revolt (but isn't that just the same as the extreme
Pragmatists' saying "it's not specifically provided for in
the Rules?"  I think this may be a distinction without a
difference.)  The extreme Platonist would characterize a
revolt as the founding of a new nomic--possibly very
similar to the old one, possibly with the same name as
the old one, but a new nomic distinct from the previous one.
(Granted, this is counterintuitive in many cases, but it
is at least self-consistent, and I'm not advocating the
extreme Platonist position, merely explaining what I
believe it to be.)

Also I note that most nomics allow Players to deregister at
any time; this can serve as a sort of revolt against gross
malfeasance within the Rules.

The underlined portion above is assumed to be the title of the Proposal, unless
specified explicitly by the proposer.  Your text clearly indicates that the
*Rule* is meant to be titled "The Miscreant", but I never assume that the title
of a new Rule in a Proposal is also meant to be the title of the Proposal
itself.

Sherlock:
>>
does InterNomic actually _do_ anything?
<<

I guess the answer is a typical "yes, but" answer: yes, it does, but
very slowly. I think that if you look at the evolution of the IN
ruleset, the proposals etc, you will find that everything looks quite
similar to other young nomics that favour a slowmoving, serious
playing style (serious as opposed to silly widget worship or nomics
like .Nomic that start with a flurry of avtivity and then die
quickly).

Ok, a good number of proposals is taken up by the peculiar way IN has
to track its voting members, but that's part of the diversity of
nomics, I guess. And for the rest, well, there have been scams of
various proportions (one of which led to the first win), there have
been the usual attempts to try and establish subgames and a
pseudoeconomy (which were rejected, whereas they often seem to be
adopted in other young nomics), there have been fixes for problems
that came up during play...

But of course, everything is moving slowly - there has to be time for
the member nomics to go through their internal routines to make
decisions. 

On the other hand, making IN proposals is easy in most nomics. As far
as Agora is concerned, you just have to send your proposal to me and
I'll pass it on to IN. BTW, this is a good way to make some money,
because the Agora reward for making successful IN proposals is quite
high.

You're mixing apples and oranges. An analogy, if I might: Take a compact
disc (or, if you insist, a record) with a scratch on it, so that one
portion of the album skips. Despite this slight difference from the usual,
this is obviously the same album as any other, non-scratched copy, just a
slightly defective copy. That doesn't mean, however, that the scratch has
no effect -- it still makes the CD skip and thus causes a slight flaw in
the CD.

PROTO: Electees v0.9
####

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement

All the cases of major deliberate abuse of Agoran Rules (by deliberate
abuse I mean deliberate, detrimental use -- i.e., I am not including Scams)
I can think of can be counted on one hand.

>I also dispute your latter claim.

Well, Pragmatism deals poorly with abuse in the sense that people *can*
change the "game state" through their abuse, unlike with Platonism.

I have to disagree. CDs are not undistinguishable (as are, for instance,
electrons) - no two copies are identical. They are, of course, similar to
some extent - but the same is true of every two entities. ;) The whole
question is, to what extent are two entities similar; we have a legal fiction
that considers two Proposals whose text differs only in white space to be
identical, and we're trying to find out whether we can extend that fiction
to consider two Proposals with a two-character difference identical.

Did Omnibus reform end up including provisions for suspension of voting

Actually, Pragmatism can cope with deliberate abuse if Players are
prepared to frame and adopt appropriate legislation to punish the
abusers.

Punishment is not the same as correcting the abuse.

(And I don't deny that a moderate Pragmatism is capable of
correcting the abuse.  Just that extreme Pragmatism is.)

To be honest, I'm not exactly sure; however, I'm fairly
sure that some earlier form of the Rule allowed (at least,
did not disallow) null-amendments, as I seem to recall
looking closely at the issue when it first arose.  It's
just that I neglected to re-evaluate the issue when
R594 was amended.  I'm assuming that the most recent
amendment to R594, by P3445, was responsible for requiring
us to ignore inapplicable provisions.  I have a copy of P3445,
and although I cannot reconstruct R594/2 from it, the comments
on the amendment of R594 imply that it was a fairly major
change (at the least, the severable provisions clause was
introduced with this amendment.)

The portion of P3445 amending R594 is reproduced below.  Perhaps
someone else has a record of earlier versions of R594?

Proposal 3445 by General Chaos (AI=3)
More Power to the People
[...]
Be it further resolved, that Rule 594 be amended to read:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

{{ This is the heart of this Proposal.  Now, when a Proposal is
   adopted, it becomes an instrument, meaning whatever it says is
   supposed to happen happens.  Fuzzy provisions are ignored, but this
   doesn't affect other parts of the Proposal unless it says it does.
   The second paragraph grants adopted Proposals the power to change
   Nomic Properties directly.  And the third paragraph puts the
   obligation on the Proposer to choose a sufficiently high AI to
   adopt all the provisions in eir Proposal, rather than making the
   Promotor figure it out, while at the same time allowing Rules (like
   Silliness) to require a specific AI for certain types of
   Proposal. }}

Sigh. I'm going to have to resign, I'm afraid. I can't afford the time
to do the job properly. 

I hereby resign and appoint Crito as my successor.

PS: Kolja just sent me two proposals, which I foolishly deleted, on
the assumption that I was not Promotor. Kolja, could you please resend
them to Crito?

I was poking around the Acka pages, and found this in Acka Rule 1320:

"The world ending has no effect on the game of Ackanomic,
except as specified in the rules."

[No, it's not *really* an example of extreme Platonism.  I'm taking
it out of context. :) ]

I don't believe that this is true.  The very thing that makes it
possible to abuse a pragmatic system makes it possible to correct for
abuse, if by no other means than an ad hoc adjustment to the game
state to correct for it.

And right the wrongs.  Fortunately, Pragmatic systems are not as tied
up in details as to be willing to grant Judges the power to issue
orders which require the performance of acts which would otherwise not
be permissible.

This does run the risk of a Lindrum-style scam, but I believe that
risk is akin to the risk of an "I Win!" rule in FRC.  It's "no fun",
and I believe that anyone who does it will be soundly thumped, and the
game restarted with their abusive actions deleted.  The old saw,
"neither the purse nor the sword" is especially applicable to the
Judge who wishes to exceed the proper authority of eir Office.
