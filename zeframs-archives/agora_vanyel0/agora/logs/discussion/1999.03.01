That's my 3830 PO, isn't it? I thought that was stayed while my case
is being reviewed. It's still being appealed.

As I recall, the CFJ has been ruled upon, but the stays have not been
vacated due to Official oversight; hence, the order depriving Vlad of
Voting Privileges is improper and should be vacated.

This report may constitute a TIA violation (by reporting an interview
with Steve Gardner that patently did not happen as if it did).  Then
again, it's questionable whether Vlad is reporting that interview as
"true". :)

Could someone explain my status now, please? Am I safe until the
appeal is Judged? Or do I pay now and hope for redress later? If
the Appeal goes against me, how long do I have before I become liable
for PI?

Well, as long as the PO is stayed, you are safe.  Apparently it is up to the
judges of the Appeal to either vacate the stay or vacate the original PO
and issue a new one for the proper amount (Scott, correct me if I am
wrong on this).

If the original PO is upheld (and the stay is vacated), then
I as Accountor will have to compute the amount of time that the PO
has been effective (i.e. total time it was in place but not stayed) to
determine PI.  Once this time reaches seven days, you will be liable to PI.
Do me a favor, though, and pay this off before the Monday following
the stay vacation and then I won't have to make this computation.  8)

If I recall correctly, you have until 72 hours after the stay is
lifted before you become overdue; the Infraction would be imposable at 
the start of each Nomic Week after the Order becomes overdue.

I note that the stay should remain in effect because the appeal has
been perfected, even though Clerk of the Courts Steve is taking his
time assigning it to a Board of Appeals.

After further review, I don't think it is.  My mistake.

ProtoProposal Chuck0122.1
Down with Proposal Numbers!

[The title of this Proposal is somewhat facetious.  I don't mean to
suggest that the Promotor should cease to assign numbers to
Proposals--only that e no longer be required to do so, and that
Proposal numbers lose any legal significance.  CFJ numbers have
*never* been required nor had any legal significance, and they've
worked just fine.]

This Proposal shall have AI=2.

Be it resolved, that Rule 109 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 376 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph which currently reads

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.

with a paragraph reading

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in the order in which they were distributed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 be amended, by replacing the
sentence which currently reads

      This publication shall include the number, title, priority, and
      time of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue.

with a sentence reading

      This publication shall include the title, priority, and time of
      Proposal, for each Proposal in the Queue.

[Actually, this "number" is left over from when Proposals received
numbers as soon as they entered the Queue.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1430 be amended, by replacing the
text reading

      (that is, the Number of the Proposal and the Entity that
      proposed it, or Rule-- or other entity-- which mandated the
      Change)

with text reading

      (that is, a reference to the Proposal and the Entity that
      proposed it, or Rule or other entity which mandated the Change)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1770 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of its
      Proposing Entity.

with a paragraph reading
