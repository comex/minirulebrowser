I am prepared to deal with whatever sanctions the Courts see fit to 
impose for such, but that does not necessarily mean that I regard as 
justified your taking justice in your own hands and penalizing such a 
move with a Kudo transfer irrespective of what the Courts decide.

As far as I'm concerned, Rule 1729 is far from clear on what it 
attempts to prohibit, and what penalties, if any, for such violations 
entail. We are also unlikely to find out unless we put it to the 
test.

As long as it's Plato-Pragmatized so the suspension depends upon
a report of the suspension, and doesn't just happen.

Again, it is the Rulekeepor's opinion that the Bank can have
a negative number of VTs, and thus RGB II has not repealed
itself yet.

Of course.  I haven't decided whether it should be the duty of the VT
Recordkeepor or of the Assessor to determine when the suspensory
conditions exist, though.  Probably the former.

Basically what I'm thinking is that we should expand the range of
penalties for Infractions and Crimes to include the suspension of
certain privileges for a fixed time, and then make the failure to
timely satisfy a PO arising from Voting an Infraction punishable by a
two-week suspension of Voting privileges.  I need to dig through the
Infraction rules to get rid of any latent Platonic traps first,
however.

I disagree; it is absurd.  How would the Bank discharge a debt to

Perhaps someone should Propose its repeal, just to be certain.  The
entire Proposal was an abortion in light of the VT snafu. :)

Ick.  There are a few problems with the Crime and Infraction Rules,
which will need to be taken care of.  However, some of them point to
problems in the judicial system as well.  Perhaps it's time for
another Great Reform... :)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1503 be amended to read:

      Any Player who commits an act defined by the Rules to be a Crime
      shall be subject to whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for
      that Crime upon a judicial finding that e did in fact commit
      that Crime.

      Any Player who commits an act defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction shall be subject to whatever penalty the Rules
      prescribe for that Infraction upon an administrative report that
      e committed that Infraction.

      The failure to perform some action when required to do so is,
      for the purpose of this Rule, an act subject to the provisions
      of this Rule.

      A judicial finding that a Player has committed a specific Crime
      consists of a judgement of TRUE in a CFJ whose Statement alleges
      that that Player has committed the specified Crime.  

      An administrative report that a Player has committed a specific
      Infraction consists of a report by a Player authorized to report
      instances of that specific Infraction that it is eir informed
      belief that the specified Player has committed the specified
      Infraction.  

      No act is a Crime or an Infraction unless defined as such by the
      Rules.  If the Rules define an act to be a Crime or an
      Infraction, but fail to prescribe a penalty for that act, then
      there is no penalty for that act.  If the Rules define an act to
      be an Infraction, but fail to authorize any Player or Players to
      report instances of that Infraction, then that Infraction cannot
      be reported.

Since you gave me a choice, I interpreted this as should be required, that is,
as a transfer of a total of 6 Indulgences.

BTW, if you look closely at the two reports I just issued, you will see that
there are two more POs for Indulgences as a result of persistent Indebtedness
from this past week.  FYI, they are POI627 and POI633.

By the means I already suggested: the Chancellor mints Currency
equal in total to the debt, then executes a Transfer Order naming
the Bank as both source and destination for that amount of Currency.

That's a strange view of what kudo transfers are for. They have nothing
to do with the justice system. I do not see how anyone could construe
my making a kudo transfer from you as 'taking justice into [my] own
hands'.

That's a pretty weak argument. This is the first time in the 8 months
that the new Virus has been operating that it has significantly
affected the duties of the Assessor. And even in this case, it was
not the infection of R1598 per se that caused the trouble (by which I
mean the discovery that certain Proposals long thought to have failed
actually passed), but our subsequent discoveries about R1442. The
actual effect of the infection - preventing the execution of any
Transfer Orders during the period of infection - was quite
straightforward and posed no special problems for the Assessor, as
indeed it did not for the other Recordkeepors who were similarly
affected.

Proto-Proposal
Bring Back Public Voting

[Comment: the Public Voting Experiment seems to have been popular,
but the renumbering of the Rule which brought it into being means
that it will end on Dec 23, since P3634 no longer amends the correct
Rule. I propose to bring it back quickly.]

[Comment: P3651 has the same problem as P3634, I've incorporated its
amendment into the proto.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Public Voting", be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

Such a Transfer Order is not permitted; the Rules require that the
destination of a Transfer Order be different from the source.  That
aside, I can't see how a debt can be eradicated either by creating new
units of currency when those new units are placed in possession of the
debtor, or alternatively by a null-op transfer.

What happens if such a Judgement gets overturned?  Or reassigned (and
the new Judge may also Judge TRUE)?
