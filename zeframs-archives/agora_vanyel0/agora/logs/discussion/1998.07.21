You know, I remember writing that, but I could've _sworn_ I asked
somebody to write a "No, really, what is a Walrus?" section. :)

Compare the similar scam I attempted in the first version of "Name that

We had a similar (and similarly ridiculous) discussion later, about whether
"triggers" could go off during an "infintesimal" time (IIRC, the issue in
question was whether the Rule which destroys a Currency if no units of it
exist would go off if all units of a Currency were destroyed and, an
infintesimal time later, new units were created.)

The problem is that the situation is self-enforcing. After you've wasted
VTs voting for bug-fix proposals which failed Quorum, you'll be less likely
to vote on others in the future...

That's one thing I will definitely spend my VTs on -- voting AGAINST any
proposal which would seek to repeal Presence. While this has certainly been
an interesting experiment, I think it has had a far more negative effect on
the game than our last experiment (Public Voting).

I just looked up S.1618 on THOMAS.  There is no Murkowski amendment to
S.1618 (there are four amendments, one by McCain, one by Feingold, one
by Feinstein, and one by Rockefeller).  If there's a Murkowski
amendment, it hasn't been enrolled yet.

I imagine this is referring to the "spamming" provisions in Title III
of the Anti-Slamming Amendments Act, which have been almost
universally decried by people who don't understand that Congress lacks
the power to ban spam altogether (doing so is prohibited by the First
Amendment).  The way to end spam is to convince ISPs to write service
contracts that forbid their customers from generating or conveying it,
so that spammers are contractually obligated to pay for their actions,
not to try to make it outright illegal, which (as I've said) cannot be
done.  In addition, contractual clauses like these would be
enforceable across national boundaries (at least in any nation having
a basic contract law) whereas national legislation obviously stops at
the border.

But I digress.

I think this is a poor argument against mandatory private voting as
opposed to optionally private voting. If anything, it is an argument for
mandatory public voting. The problem was not that Players were *unsure*
about who was Assessor, just they happened to be *incorrect* about who
was Assessor. Had any Players sent you votes, I feel quite sure that
they would have done so confident that you were the Assessor, and this
would have been equally true if their votes had been sent to you
privately as a matter of choice rather than necessity.

That's true, and if I take no action, that should be what will happen,
since I think Blob has Proposals in the Queue ahead of mine.

It seems to have been part of the manager's amendment. (Refer
to Sen. Murkowski's remarks on the bill in the Congressional
record.)  Still, it is popularly known as the Murkowski
amendment.

That's far from certain.  As you well know, the Supreme Court has
long allowed "time, place, or manner" restrictions on speech.

Since I'm not the Accountor, I am in the habit of routinely deleting
such messages. But I did transfer 4 VTs to Macross to pay him for the 2
Indulgences I bought from him.

If someone still has it, could you send me a copy of my

I know, I know, I really should save those, at least for
a while.

Thanks,
