To my mind R786 says things about who fills the Office of S-E only
in the following paragraphs:

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is
      held by that Active Player highest in the order of succession
      who has not yet declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one
      Active Player in the order of succession who has not declined,
      that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

Nothing else in the rule suggests what happens before the three day
period begins.  And the three day period begins when the Speaker makes
their announcement.  

Michael.

I think you should simply say "holds the Office" here as there is no
reason why temporary holders of the Office should be immune to "DoD".

I think you should allow the Delegating Player to resume in Office
earlier if they want to do so.

I think this should be 
     
        If at any time the Speaker is Electee ...

Should be:
       
        If a Player is ever simultaneously the Electee for the Clerk
        of the Courts and Justiciar, then they are removed from the
        Office of Justiciar. 
 
Otherwise great. 

One thing you could also do is to give either the Registrar or the
Speaker the right to appoint Players to hold Offices temporarily when
the Speaker can not do so, as long as those Players are permitted to
be Electees for that Office.  You could then remove the S-E transition
rule which is a mess, and you would also thereby remove the
possibility of the default Justice Board being less than three
people. 

Michael.

I disagree that this is the essence of the argument.  I don't think it
matters one way or another whether you see the obligation as new and
inherited.  If it is new, then you agree that the obligation must be
dealt with by the end of the week.  If it is inherited, I believe that
there are two rules both saying things about when the Report is to be
published.  In my opinion, they don't conflict.  Rather R1686 simply
imposes a stricter requirement on the new Officer.  Again, I appeal to
the definition of ASAP which explicitly says:

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

You say 

> If the obligation is inherited, then R1585 governs and I have a
> whole week from the time I assume the Office to post the Report.

But R1585 does *not* say that the new holder is allowed to take the
full week to perform their duties; it simply requires that the duties
be performed within that week.  R1686 and R1585 do not clash. 

If CFJ 1061 says something different, it seems to me that it is either
wrong, or perhaps inapplicable because of a change in the rules.

Michael.

I suppose so.  I don't see the point in the Spivak pronouns myself;
they/them etc are perfectly adequate, but I think I'm on the wrong
side of the debate as far as Agora is concerned.

I don't think "they" is the correct form for a singular person, which
was the point of my correction.  At first "e" and "em" made me
uncomfortable, but having gotten used to them I now see the
advantages.

It is correct, but often ambiguous, to use a plural pronoun as a
gender-neutral singular pronoun.  At least, it's correct in the third
person ("they"), makes no difference in the second person ("you"),
and is a well-known dialect in the first person ("we").

The truth of this statement is still hotly debated by grammarians and
literary types.  While _some_ people have accepted the use of "they"
as a gender-inspecific third person pronoun, I would be surprised to
find that a majority of English-language "authorities" have done so.
(Personally, I find that usage extremely grating.)

It is also correct to use a masculine pronoun as a gender-neutral
singular pronoun.  Neither of these is the solution commonly used
in Agora.

The use of masculine pronouns as generics is often opposed not
on the grounds of grammatical correctness, but that such
usage is offensive to females.  As I singular entity, I likewise take
offense at being referred to in the plural.  1/2 :)

Oops, the Scam got counter-Scammed:  the new Speaker found another Rule
allowing any player to arbitrarily lengthen a proposal's voting period.
