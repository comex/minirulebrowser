"When a Player goes On Hold, all Payment Orders naming em as payee
 are stayed; each such Payment Order is assigned an Elapsed Time
 equal to the length of time since it was executed.

 When a Player comes Off Hold, each Payment Orders naming em as payee
 and having an Elapsed Time is reinstated, as if it had been executed
 at a time equal to the current time minus its Elapsed Time."

Is it possible to vacate an Order twice, then vacate one of those Orders
to Vacate?  If so, does the original Order regain effect, despite the
non-vacated Order to Vacate?  Perhaps Rule 1802 could borrow the last
sentence of Rule 1801, just in case.

Wasn't the point oringially to stay POs incurred _while_ on Hold?
In which case, the above doesn't work. And I'm not sure I like allowing
players to stay POs just by going on hold. You should pay your debts
before going awaym or face the consequences.
