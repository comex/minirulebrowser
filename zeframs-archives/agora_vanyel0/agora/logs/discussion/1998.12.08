If you could dig up the relevant information, I might be persuaded
by game custom.

How can it be true that on Dec 6 1998, July 4 1776 was not legally
the birthday of the US, and on Dec 7 1998 it was, without a retroactive
change?  Yet you seem to concede the correctness of my example, only
challenging whether its analogy with the current situation is valid.

On further reflection, I'll forgo my claim (for the time being--I
reserve the right to reinstate it at a later time) that the VP
of Proposals 3810-3812 ended 7 days after their distribution.

The question to be resolved first, I think, is whether the VP
of Proposals 3810-3812 ends 10 days after their distribution.
(I repeat, I wish to consider this question independently of
whether the VP ends 7 days after their distribution.)
I do not see how this can be so--Rule 693 currently says the
VP lasts for 7 days after a Proposal's distribution--*in the
form in which R693 is currently in effect*.  It seems to
me that an interpretation which says that the VPs end 10 days
after they were distributed is in violation of the current
form of R693.

(In considering the question this way, there's no issue of retroactive
effect.  Even if I concede that the VP did not end 7 days after
distribution, I am still not convinced that it ends 10 days after
distribution.  The only Rule which would support that interpretation
is Rule 693/3, but that form of that Rule is no longer in effect.)

Yes, but there is another option, which to me sounds more natural: Before
the Proposal was adopted, the voting period was 10 days. After that it was
7 days. So, just before the Proposal was adopted, we were still in the voting
period, but just after it we were not. The only logical way in which this
can be is by assuming that the Voting Period for Proposals 3810-3812 ended
at the moment P3809 was adopted.

Or rather, at the time the voting results of P3809 were published (or
is that what you mean by "adopted"? I thought that "adoption" happens
at the end of the voting period, and "taking effect" happens when the
results are published).

Sorry, yes, I did mean "take effect", not "adopted".

Which makes the voting period for those Proposals something which is
neither seven nor ten days, consistent with neither the current nor
the prior form of the Rule.

Haven't you taken the position in the past that natural laws take
precedence over the Rules? Perhaps this is the application of
just such a law (which one is left as an exercise for the reader).

Steve (or anyone else who cares to answer, but mainly Steve):

Would it be fair to say that you believe the difference between
my July 4 1776 example and the End of a Voting Period is that
the former is simply a designation of a time in the past, while
the latter is an event?  (And if not, how would you characterize it?)

I wouldn't put it that way.  I think it would be fair to say that your July 4 example is one that changes the "legal" significance of a date in the past at the time of adoption, but has no collateral effects on events in the past.  The current situation, however, has collateral effects on votes in the past - they are retroactively changed from legal votes to "meaningless" PF messages.

IMO, R108 prevents votes cast prior to the adoption of "Ten Days is too Long" from being deprived of their significance as legal votes and R101 prevents the Voting period of the proposals in question from extending beyond the adoption of "Ten Days".  The net effect is the one Andre (I think it was Andre) expounded, that the actual voting period on those proposals is an intermediate length.

--Crito

PS.  I wonder if this will get through.  My Herald's report is still not showing up.

I don't think there is any need to look for retroactivity where none
is needed. The Voting Period is not an "attribute" of a Proposal, in
my opinion - not in the sense of being a Nomic Property, if you
will. Rather, the Rules state that some things (such as Votes) have
legal significance only if sent later than the time a Proposal a 
distributed, and earlier than that time plus X days. Before the 
adoption of 3809, that clearly and unambiguously defined a period
of time which had not yet ended at the time 3809 was adopted;
after the passage of 3809, it clearly and unambiguously defined a
period of time which was over by the time Chaos attempted to
Vote.

With the feeling of someone walking into a trap, I agree that this is

I think it would be fair to say that your July 4 example is one that changes the "legal" significance of a date in the past at the time of adoption, but has no collateral effects on events in the past.  The current situation, however, has collateral effects on votes in the past - they are retroactively changed from legal votes to "meaningless" PF messages.

How is that retroactive, if the change in status takes place when
P3809 takes effect, not when the voting message was sent?

I think I agree with this reasoning.

An interesting situation arises, though, with the requirement that
the Assessor publish votes, defined in R208:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period on a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast
      upon that Proposal.

I would argue that for P3810-3812, this requirement is never triggered.
However, that does not change the effect of publishing the Proposal
results when the Assessor *chooses* to do so.

Walking into a trap?  Maybe...I'm not quite sure myself where I'm going
with this.  :)

I will agree with you that an event cannot be retroactive.
But even if the end of the VP is an event rather than a designation,
I still don't see that the end of the VP ends at D+10 (where D is
the distribution of Proposals 3810-3812).

Would you argue that the timing of an event cannot be changed
prior to its happening?  (It seems to me that is what you are
arguing in saying the VP still ends at D+10.)

Consider the following:

R2525: blah blah effects.  This Rule shall repeal itself on Jan. 1 2000.

P4444 (takes effect Dec. 1 1999): R2525 is amended by deleting its final
sentence.

Now, surely you would not argue that R2525 still repeals itself on Jan. 1
2000?

What if instead, we had:

P4444 (takes effect Dec. 1 1999): R2525 is amended by changing "Jan. 1 2000"
to "Jan. 1 1999".

Would you then argue that R2525 repeals itself on Jan. 1 2000?  I would
argue that it does not repeal itself at all.

My point here is that the timing of an event set in the future by the
Rules can be altered by Rule Changes prior to the set time for
that event.  Just because the timing of the end of the VP was
once set to D+10, does not mean that time is set in stone to D+10
regardless of any Rule changes that happen prior to D+10.

Just as in these cases R2525 does not repeal itself on 1/1/2000, I
would argue that the voting period of P3810-3812 does not end at D+10.
(When it does end, I'm not quite sure.  If the end of the VP is an event,
it might never end at all.  Andre's suggestion that it ends when P3809
took effect is predicated, I think, on a slightly different model
than the end of the VP being an event.)

As I was updating R693, I noted (I had forgotten this) that R693
was infected by the virus in September 1997.  Does anyone recall
what was concluded in those cases?  (Even better, does anyone
have documents, especially CFJs, relevant to those cases?)

iv) The VP has not ended (and will not, under the current Rules).

I am fairly certain that (ii) is wrong, as I have been arguing
recently.  But I'm not sure which of (i), (iii), or (iv) is correct.

Chuck, here's the text of P3533 you wanted:

To: nomic-business@teleport.com
Subject: BUS: Re: OFF: Proposals 3531-3533 
Date: Wed, 09 Jul 1997 13:22:02 -0500
From: Scott Goehring <scott@poverty.bloomington.in.us>

I just noticed that the end of Pragmatic Currencies, as distributed,
is mangled; section IX is damaged.  I therefore claim that the
distribution of Proposal 3533 (incorrectly numbered 3532 in one place)
is in error, in that the Proposal should read as follows:

I. Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1598 be retitled "Transfer Orders"
and amended to read:

      A Transfer Order is an order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Transfer Order is submitted when the Executor of the source
      entity specified in the Order transmits the Order to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in the Order, or whenever
      the Rules otherwise state that a Transfer Order is submitted.
      Unless otherwise specified, a Transfer Order is executed upon
      being submitted.  In no case may any Transfer Order be executed
      prior to its submission or without having ever been submitted.
 
      When a Transfer Order is executed, if the source possesses at
      least as many units of the specified Currency as specified in
      the Order, the number of units of that specified Currency shall
      be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
      entity.  Such an Order is said to have been successfully
      executed.

      However, if the source entity does not possess sufficient units
      of the specified Currency, then no transfer occurs, and the
      Recordkeepor shall, as soon as possible, notify the Executors of
      the source and destination that the Transfer Order was not
      successfully executed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Delayed Transfer Orders" and the following text:

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Implicit Transfer Orders" and the following text:

      The Rules, and only the Rules, may specify that certain actions,
      such as Voting, are also implicitly the submission of one or
      more Transfer Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly
      the submission of a Transfer Order is the sending of a message
      from the Executor of the source entity of the Transfer Order to
      the Recordkeepor of the Currency involved, or to the Public
      Forum.  Such implicitly submitted Transfer Orders may be delayed
      Transfer Orders, if the Rules which specify them as implicit
      Transfers Orders also specify them to be delayed.  A
      Recordkeepor may not reject a implicitly submitted delayed
      Transfer Order.

      Similarly, the Rules may specify that certain actions are also
      implicitly cancellations of certain types of delayed Transfer
      Orders, subject to the same restrictions specified above for
      implicitly submitted Transfer Orders.  

II. Payment Orders

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be retitled "Payment Orders"
and amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts the Order to the Public
      Forum.

      A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment Order if e
      required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to execute that
      Order.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.  However, the Recordkeepor need only maintain records
      of satisfied or vacated Orders for four weeks after they have
      been satisfied or vacated.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Satisfaction of Payment Orders" and the following text:

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order from the
      payor named in that Payment Order to the payee of that Payment
      Order for the currency and amount named in that Payment Order is
      successfully executed, provided that, when that Transfer Order
      was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated that that
      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.
      
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended to read:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which was executed
      more than seven days ago, which has been neither satisfied nor
      vacated, and which is not subject to dispute.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.
      
      Each Recordkeepor is authorized to report this Infraction, which
      carries a penalty of one Blot.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Disputed Payment Orders" and the following text:

      A Payment Order is disputed if there is a COE regarding it which
      has not been denied, or a CFJ challenging the legality of its
      execution which is either presently assigned to a Judge or to a
      Board of Appeals for consideration.

      When a a COE regarding a Payment Order is accepted, the order
      shall be vacated (and an new order issued, if appropriate).  The
      Judge of a CFJ which finds that a Payment Order was illegally or
      improperly executed shall make an Injunction requiring the Clerk
      of the Courts to vacate the illegal Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the tile
"Vacated Payment Orders" and the following text:

      A Payment Order is vacated when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts to the Public Forum a
      notice to the effect that a given Payment Order is being
      vacated.  This notice must clearly identify the Payment Order
      being vacated.
      
      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency in that Payment Order shall execute a new Payment
      Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with the payor
      and payee interchanged.

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that
      Order.

III. The Chancellor

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title "The
Chancellor as Bank's Executor" and the following text:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or
      CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player
      makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer Order),
      e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

IV. Judicial Powers

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Injunctions on Payment Orders" and the following text:

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be enacted with the title
"Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders" and the following text:

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be vacated.  If the
      Payment Order named by such an Injunction is vacated, and the
      Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who vacated that
      Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the Injunction
      was set aside, execute a new Payment Order identical to the
      vacated Payment Order.

V. Probate

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1468 be repealed.  Further, for each
Treasury which existed immediately prior to the repeal of this Rule,
and for each Currency, a number of units of that Currency equal to the
number of units that were in that Treasury (whether positive or
negative) shall be placed in the possession of the owner of that
Treasury.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1469 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be retitled "Probate" and
amended to read:

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any units of
      Currency; if an entity which possesses units of Currency would
      otherwise be destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate,
      and its destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of Probate.

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with the title
"Executors in Probate" and the following text:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read as follows:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity with which it is
      associated, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When a entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.
      
VI. Legislative definitions

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be retitled "Definition of
'Pay Out' and 'Bill'" and amended to read:

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some quantity of
      Currency to some entity, that Player shall execute a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that entity for the amount specified.

      Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill an entity for some
      quantity of Currency, that Player shall execute a Payment Order
      from that entity to the Bank for the amount specified.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1599 be retitled "Failure to Execute
Payment Orders" and amended to read:
      
      Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment Order, e is
      required to do so within seven days.  If a Player who is
      required to execute a Payment Order by the Rules fails to do so
      in the time required by this and other Rules, and a CFJ
      determines that this has in fact happened, the Judge of that CFJ
      shall make an Injunction requiring emself to execute the Order
      required in the stead of the nonperforming Player.  If a Player
      deregisters or goes On Hold without executing a Payment Order
      which e was required to execute, the Speaker shall execute it
      instead.

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different time
      limit for executing Payment Orders.

VII. Rectification of Existing Law

Be it further resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:
      
      The Clerk of the Courts shall, whenever a Player has earned a
      judicial salary, make a report of this fact in the Public Forum.
      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Clerk of the Court
      shall pay out the judicial salaries earned during the preceding
      week, except as noted below.

      Any judicial salary earned but not yet paid shall not be paid if
      the decision for which the salary was earned is currently
      subject to an appeal at the end of the Nomic Week in which it
      was earned.  In this case, the salary shall be paid at the end
      of the Nomic Week in which the appeal is decided, and then only
      if the appeal upholds the original decision.

      If a decision is overturned in the same Nomic Week in which it
      was made, no salary shall be paid for the original decision.

      If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall vacate the Payment Order paying the salary
      originally received for that decision.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1007 be retitled "Salaries of
Officers" and amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Officer the designated Salary for each Office that
      Officer has held without interruption for the entire five days
      preceding.

      If the Rules pertaining to an Office require that Officer to
      publish a document at least once per Nomic Week, then no payment
      of Salary shall be made in a given Nomic Week if that document
      was not distributed in the previous Week.

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.
      Salaries are permitted to be expressed in terms of the
      Basic Salary.  Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an
      Office shall be equal to the Basic Salary.
      
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1047 be amended to read:

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.  All current holders of the Title of
      Zeitgeist lose the Title whenever it is newly awarded.  The
      Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting the awarding
      of this Patent Title.

      When a Player is awarded the Patent Title of Zeitgeist, the
      Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1437 be retitled "Fugitives from
Justice" and amended to read:

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
      rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
      one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
      assess against em a number of Blots equal to the number of
      Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
      reregistration.  Eir Fugitive Blots are then removed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1457 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph beginning, "Whenever such a CFJ is found FALSE, ..."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1465 be amended to read:

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player.  At the onset of that Player's Champion's Reward,
      the Assessor shall pay out ten VTs to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has
      not yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on
      any Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion.  This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1504 be amended to read:

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.  

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1534 be repealed.  (Rule 1534 is
unnecessary, as an Organizations' SLC already has the power to require
entities within its Jurisdiction to execute Transfer Orders.  The
failure of a Player within an Organization to execute a Transfer Order
required of em is subject to judicial review under Rule 1457.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1654 be amended to read:

      The Registrar shall pay out 10 VTs to any Player who is awarded
      the Degree of Doctor of Nomic History.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended to read:

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player in VTs for an
      amount not in excess of 1 VT.  The Player to receive the award
      must not have received a Patronage award within the preceding
      four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a reason along with the
      Payment Order.
      
      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1662 be amended to read:

      At the end of every month, if the same Player was Speaker for
      that entire month, the Registrar shall pay out a Speaker's
      Gratuity of two VTs to the Speaker.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1666 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1670 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph which begins, "If the Distributor is a Player, ..." with:

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, at the
      beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out one Voting Token to the
      Distributor, in recognition of eir service.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1677 be amended to read:

      Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
      pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1678 be amended to read:

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over
      Rules that would prevent this award.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1684 be amended to read:

      When the last Voting Period on a Proposal distributed in a given
      Nomic Week ends, the Assessor shall pay out to each each Player
      who cast a vote on any Proposal distributed during that Nomic
      Week 2/3 as many Voting Tokens as there were Proposals
      distributed in that Week (rounded down to the nearest integer),
      or 8 Voting Tokens, whichever is less.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended to read:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.  The Promotor has the duty
      to publish, at least once a week in the Public Forum, a report
      of the number of P-Notes in each treasury that possesses
      P-Notes, and a list of all the changes in P-Note holdings since
      the last such report with the reason for those changes.

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that
      Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1705 be amended to read:

      Upon the first of every month, the Wizard shall pay out to each
      Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of P-Notes
      equal to half their Style, rounded down.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, for each
      Indulgence in the Bank, pay out one Indulgence to a randomly
      selected Active Player.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 833 be amended to read:

      The entity which paid the Petition fee for a given Proposal
      shall be known as the Sponsor of that Proposal.

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out to the Sponsor a number of P-Notes equal to the
      number of FOR Votes less the number of AGAINST Votes.

      If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR
      Votes, the Assessor shall bill the Sponsor for a number of
      P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes less the number of FOR
      Votes.

      If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same
      entity and the Proposal passes, the Assessor shall pay out 2
      P-Notes to the Proposer.  If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
      Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
      shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note.  This is in addition to any
      other payments required by this or other Rules.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Votes by Voting Entities which are
      not Players do not count.

      The Assessor shall execute all Payment Orders required by this
      Rule no later than the time e announces the Voting Results of
      the Proposal in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 947 be amended to read:

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1377 be amended to read:

      There is an Office of Herald.

      The Herald's Report includes the following:

      - The Honour of every Entity that has been a Player at any
        time within the last three months, and the changes thereof
        since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      - The reason for each such change; in the case of a
        Player-initiated change this includes any justification
        provided by the Player.

      - The Currency Records for Indulgences.

      - A list of all Fugitives from Justice, and the number of
        Fugitive Blots attributed to each such Fugitive.

      The Herald shall receive a weekly salary equal to 2 times
      the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1435 be amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended to read:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end of
      the Voting Period of that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1451 be amended to read:

      A Proposal is disowned when its Proposer sends a message to the
      Public Forum disowning it, provided that the Proposal in
      question either has not yet been distributed, or less than four
      days have passed since its distribution.  A Proposal can only be
      disowned by its Proposer, and then only if its Proposer is
      neither the Assessor nor has been the Assessor at any time after
      the distribution of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one
      P-Note.  All other payments or awards of Currency which would
      result from the submission of, voting upon, or adoption of that
      Proposal do not take place, regardless of the outcome of the
      Vote on that Proposal.  This Rule, however, neither requires nor
      permits any Payment Orders already executed as a result of this
      Proposal to be vacated.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would seek to
      cause the payment or award of Currencies as a result of the
      submission of, voting upon, or adoption of, a Disowned Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1470 be amended to read:

      There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank has
      Mint Authority.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be amended to read:

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1536 be repealed.  (Organizations
which wish to specify dissolution transfers should file a Will with
the Notary.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1543 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "The Player who is Wizard, ..." (if such a
paragraph exists) with the paragraph:

      The Wizard shall, in each Nomic Week in which e produces a
      Wizard's Report, pay out one P-Note to emself as compensation
      for his duties.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.
      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1579 be amended to read:

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1593 be repealed.  (Rule 1593 is as
unnecessary as Rule 1534.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1472 be repealed.  (Transfers are
completely defined by the Rules amended and created in Sections I and
II of this Proposal.)

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1653 be amended to read:

      If a Group, during the Voting Period of a Proposal, successfully
      executes a Transfer Order for 3 VTs from itself to the Bank for
      the purpose of declaring Unity on that Proposal, casts exactly 3
      Votes FOR or 3 Votes AGAINST the Proposal in question, and
      informs the Assessor that it is electing to cast a Unity Vote on
      that Proposal, then that Group has declared Unity on that
      Proposal.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and all of its Members
      Vote on that Proposal, and all of the Votes of its Members are
      the same as the Votes of the Group, then the Group is entitled
      to cast 3 Votes on that Proposal, at zero cost.  Furthermore,
      the Assessor shall pay out 3 VTs to the Group.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and not all of its
      Members express an Intent to Vote, or not all of the intended
      Votes of its Members are the same as the intended Votes of the
      Group, then the Group is not entitled to cast any Votes on that
      Proposal, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1702 be amended to read:

      All Proposals have associated with them a Petition fee.  The
      Petition fee for any Proposal is one P-Note, unless another Rule
      specifies a higher fee.  This rule takes precedence over any
      Rule that would require a lower fee, no fee, or a fee paid in
      Currency other than P-Notes.

      The Petition Fee for a Proposal is paid when an entity
      successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of that
      Proposal's Petition Fee, provided that e indicates clearly that
      the Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Petition fee for
      that Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1714 be amended, by replacing the
phrase "less than -30 Indulgences" with "more than 30 Blots".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1528 be amended, by replacing the
text reading:

      iii) A Treasury.
       iv) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

with:

      iii) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1578 be amended, by replacing the
words "in the various Treasuries which exist" with "by the various
entities which possess units of that Currency".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1605 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "Any other Rule notwithstanding, ..." with:

      Any other Rule notwithstanding, in order to make a Proposal, a
      Proposing Entity must have an Executor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1687 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1696 be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Assessor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

      The Assessor's Report includes the number of VTs possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Assessor's Report.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, that the paragraphs
reading as follows

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that at 00:04:30 GMT +1200 on Agora's
      Birthday, each Player shall receive 3 VTs, and such transfers
      shall be detected and reported by the Assessor;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that each Player who posts to the Public
      Forum a message recognizing Agora's Birthday, on Agora's
      Birthday, shall receive 1 P-Note at the end of Agora's Birthday,
      and such transfers shall be detected and reported by the
      Promotor;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and such Contests shall receive 5
      VTs each, and their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each, and such
      transfers shall be detected and reported by the Notary;

be amended to read

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      BIrth a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to each such
      Contest 5 VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

VIII. The Probate Code

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created, with the title "The
Probate Code" and the following text:

      Section 1. General

      The steps described herein shall be executed by an Executor in
      Probate, in order by increasing section number.

      If, in order to perform the duties required herein, the Executor
      in Probate would have to consider, in any way, a Payment Order
      which is presently disputed, e shall not proceed, but shall wait
      until the dispute regarding that Payment Order is resolved.

      Section 2. Procedure for Fair Division

      When an amount of Currency (either as units in possession of the
      estate, or units due the estate as credits) is to be divided,
      the following procedure shall be used:

      1. The Executor in Probate shall first divide the amount of
         Currency amongst the creditors of the estate proportionally
         to the residual debts of each creditor, rounding each share
         down to the appropriate MUQ.  The surplus is the amount
         remaining after this initial division is completed.
      2. The surplus, if any, shall then be added to the share of the
         creditor with the greatest remaining residual debt whose
         share does not already equal eir remaining residual debt.  In
         the event of a tie, the Executor in Probate shall select a
         creditor at random.  If there is no such creditor, the
         surplus is retained.  This step shall be repeated until there
         is no more surplus, or no more creditors with residual debt
         unequal to their share.
      3. If at any time in the above process, any portion of any
         creditor's share exceeds eir residual debt, this excess
         portion shall be removed from eir share and added to the
         surplus.

      Section 3. Distribution of Assets to Creditors

      For each Currency of which the estate possesses units, the
      Executor in Probate shall divide those units according to the
      procedure in Section 2, and shall submit Transfer Orders from
      the estate to each creditor for the amount of that creditor's
      share.

      Section 4. Reassignment of Credits to Creditors

      For each debtor of the estate, in an order to be determined by
      the Executor in Probate, the Executor in Probate shall determine
      the sum of the credits due the estate from that debtor
      (separately for each Currency), and shall divide that sum
      amongst the creditors according to the procedure in Section 2,
      and shall execute Payment Orders from that debtor to each
      creditor for the amount of that creditor's share.  If there is a
      surplus amount, the Executor in Probate shall execute a Payment
      Order from the creditor to the estate for the amount of the
      surplus.  The Executor in Probate shall then vacate the credits
      thus reassigned.

      Section 5. Discharge of Residual Debts

      The Executor in Probate shall vacate all remaining debts of the
      estate.  

      Section 6. Distribution of Residual Assets to Heirs

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      The Executor in Probate shall execute the provisions of the Will
      of the estate, if a Will exists.  If residual assets exist after
      the execution of the Will, the Executor in Probate shall
      distribute them to the heirs of the estate in the manner
      described in Sections 3 and 4, except that heirs replace
      creditors, and each heir is considered to have residual debt
      computed according to the provisions for division as specified
      in the Will (or equal to the residual assets divided equally, if
      there is no provision).

      Section 7. Remission of Unclaimed Assets

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      For each Currency, the Executor in Probate shall submit a
      Transfer Order from the estate to the Mintor of that Currency
      for all the units of that Currency remaining in the estate,
      excepting any units which cannot be transferred for any reason.
      The Executor in Probate shall also vacate any remaining credits
      of the estate at this time.

      Section 8. Destruction of Immobile Assets

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      The Executor in Probate shall destroy any units of Currency
      which remain in the estate.

      Section 9. Termination of Probate

      The Executor in Probate shall announce that Probate of the
      estate is complete.

      Section 10. Definitions

      The following definitions are used throughout this Rule.

      1. Estate: the entity in Probate.
      
      2. Debt: A Payment Order which names the estate as payor.

      3. Credit: A Payment Order which names the estate as payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Residual debt of a creditor: the total of the amounts of the
         debts for which that creditor is the payee, less the sum of
         all amounts transferred from the estate to that creditor
         according to Section 3, and the amounts of all credits
         reassigned to that creditor according to Section 4.

      7. Residual assets: the total of the units of Currency held by
         the estate and the credits of the estate, after the steps in
         Sections 3, 4, 5 have been completed.

      Note: Residual debt and residual assets are computed
      independently for each Currency involved.

IX. Treasury Rectification

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      For each entity other than the Bank which possesses a negative
      quantity of any Currency at the time this Rule is enacted, the
      Chancellor shall, as soon as possible after the enactment of
      this Rule, execute Transfer Order(s) from the Bank to that
      entity for an amount of each such Currency equal to the absolute
      value of the negative amount possessed of that Currency, and
      shall also execute a Payment Order from that entity to the Bank
      for the same amount of that Currency.

      After all such Transfer and Payment Orders have been
      successfully executed, this Rule repeals itself.

The infection of R693 in September 1997 was the subject of CFJ 944,
reposted here. However, it's not clear to me precisely what the
significance of this Judgement is to the present case. The argument
given by the Caller, Crito, endorsed both by me and by the Judge, Chuck,
concluded that Rules may act in the past; only Rule Changes may not.
However, in this case, it is the precisely the application of a Rule
Change that it is at issue. But more importantly, shortly after the
events referred to in this CFJ took place, and directly as a result of
them, Chuck and I collaborated to alter the wording of R108 to more
effectively prohibit retroactive action of Rules, not just Rules
Changes (see P3572, adopted Oct. 30, 1997). 

In any case, here's CFJ 944; make of it what you will.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 944

For proposals distributed during the infection of R693, the ten days
immediately following the distribution of each such proposal will be
designated its Voting Period immediately upon the disinfection of R693.

  Judged TRUE by Chuck 26 Sep 1997 02:10:39 -0500
======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I judge CFJ 944 to be TRUE.

R&A:

First, I should note that I take "designated" in the statement
to mean "designated, with legal significance" rather than just
designated by some random person.

There are two issues at hand here: first, does 108 prohibit
only direct retroactive effects of Rule Changes--the Changes
themselves--or does it prohibit indirect retroactive effects
as well, e.g. new effects of Rules changed by a Rule Change,
taking effect before the Rule Change which specified that form
of the Rule?

I would argue that both Game Custom and the best interests of
the game require us to interpret it as the latter--indirect
as well as direct retroactive effects of Rule Changes are
prohibited.  However, because of my finding on the second issue
(below), this point is actually irrelevant to this Judgement.

The second issue is whether the effect described in this CFJ
is, in fact, such an indirect retroactive effect.  It is not.
The mere designation of a time period as a certain term does
not necessarily take place during that time period.  In this
case, the period in question is from the distribution of a
proposal until ten days afterwards; but that does not, in 
this case, take effect at the commencement of that period--it
takes place when 693 is disinfected.  To put it another way,
it is important to distinguish between the time period which
is designated, and the time at which the designation takes effect.
For the designation to take place after the commencement of
the period is awkward, to be sure, it is not retroactive.

To make a slightly clearer analogy: it would be perfectly legal
and effective to enact a Rule which stated, "July 4, 1776 is
the birthday of the United States."  Before the enactment
of the Rule, July 4, 1776 has no special designation.  Afterwards,
it is designated as the birthday of the U.S.  Since the
designation does not take effect until the Rule does, this
is not a retroactive effect.

What implications this may have for actually voting on proposals
as described in this CFJ is an issue I have not yet analyzed, and
thus decline to comment on at this time.

Chuck

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments (slighted edited):

See my argument above concerning retroactive rule effects.  Another
example may help (which is why I worded the CFJ as I did).  The disinfection of
R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  This would retroactively give a
significance to those days, an effect which, I contend, is not prohibited by
R108.

'my argument above' is pointing to the following text (this line is
an insertion by the CotC):

Thankyou for a most enlightening discussion, Chuck. I think I see now
that most of my arguments have actually been directed against the view
that the VP ended at D+7. But I think we can both agree at least on the
truth of the conditional: if the end of the VP is viewed as an event
(which is how I see it; your commitments are less clear), then the VP
cannot end at D+7 without a retroactive application of the Rule. This is
equivalent to your second case above, where the date of self-repeal is
amended to be a date in the past. I think I agree with you that in such
a case, the Rule does not repeal itself at all. Applying that lesson
here, it may well be the case that the VP cannot end at all, at least
not without further legislation, since the effect of P3809 has been to
change the occurrence of the end of the VP to a date in the past.

I have two remarks about this legal outcome: first, it shows that P3809
should have contained specific grandfathering clauses to deal with this
situation, a lesson we should learn for the future; second, it is
consistent with the requirement that whatever legal resolution we adopt,
it must not have the effect of altering the legal statuses of votes
which were legally cast at the time they were cast. Any such change I
would also regard as a prohibited retroactive application of a Rule.
However, if the VP has not yet concluded, then all the votes cast so
far, even those cast after D+10 (if there are any), were and are legal.

According to the FLR, the infection occurred on Sep. 14, 1997 and lasted
for two weeks, until Sep. 28. It is therefore interesting to consider
the treatment of P3550, whose VP commenced on Sep. 8. Scott, the
Assessor at the time, reported matter-of-factly on Sep. 19 that:

Voting for 3550 commenced: Mon, 08 Sep 1997 15:21:23 UTC
Voting for 3550 concluded: Thu, 18 Sep 1997 15:21:23 UTC

This despite the fact the R693 was without effect at the time. Scott's
report was not challenged in any way, but accepted without controversy.
I think this shows that, at least historically, the VP of a Proposal has
been viewed as an attribute of a Proposal fixed at the time the Proposal
is distributed. 

Of course, this is only weak game custom (to employ another distinction
of Chuck's), and views can evolve. But it does seem relevant to the
present case.
