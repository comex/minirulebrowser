Wow! You could even try to pass a proposal defining what is ment by 
"law" without objection (I'm sure everybody would like such a proposal), 
just so people like me are not confused... Thanx.

Why isn't it posable for the proposer of a proposal to amend proposals 
that they proposed, whilst they are still in the proposal queue?

Protoproposal: Amending Proposals

Create a new rule entitled "The Amending of Proposals" which reads as
follows:

A proposal in the Proposal Queue may be amended at any time by its proposer.
Upon so doing, its priority becomes zero.

Protoproposal Chaos223 [rev. 3]

Revamp the Promotor's Office

| Be it resolved, that Rules 1036, 1839, 1770, 1771, 1772, 1773 and 1774
| be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) A Proposal enters the Proposal Queue when it is received
          from a Proposing Entity by the Promotor.

      (b) A Proposal leaves the Proposal Queue when it is distributed,
          withdrawn, or discarded, or when the Rules otherwise require
          it.

      (c) The Promotor may, by Public Forum Announcement, discard any
          Proposal in the Proposal Queue which was Proposed over a
          month previously and which has zero or negative Priority.

      (d) The Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may, by Public Forum
          Announcement, remove that Proposal from the Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

|     (a) Each Proposal in the Proposal Queue has a priority, which
|         shall be an integer multiple of the MUQ for P-Notes.
        (1) When a Proposal enters the Proposal Queue, it has a
            priority of zero.
        (2) Any Player may, by Public Forum Announcement, increase or
            decrease the Priority of a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
            by any amount provided that e simultaneously transfers to
|           the Bank a quantity of P-Notes equal in number to the
|           magnitude of the change e wishes to make, and further
|           provided that that transfer is not made for any other
|           purpose.
        (3) At most once in each week, the Promotor may, by Public
            Forum Announcement, increase by one the Priority of any
            Proposal in the Proposal Queue, provided that the Proposal
            was not Proposed by emself.
        (4) At the beginning of each month, the priority of all
            Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
            month previously is decreased by one.  The Promotor shall
            report all such changes as soon as possible after the
            beginning of the month.

      (b) Proposals in the Proposal Queue are sorted in Queue Order by
          ordering them by descending Priority; Proposals with the
          same Priority are ordered by increasing time in the Proposal
          Queue.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each week, the Promotor shall select from the Proposal Queue
          and distribute a number of Proposals equal to that week's
          Proposal Limit.
        (1) The Proposal Limit for a given week shall be the lesser
            of:
|         (A) the number of Proposals, at the time of the first
|             distribution of Proposals in that week, in the Proposal
|             Queue with Priority greater than the Priority Bar; and
          (B) the Maximum Proposal Limit in effect at the start of
              that week.
        (2) Proposals shall be selected for distribution from the head
            of the Proposal Queue, in descending Queue Order.

      (b) The Maximum Proposal Limit is an integer between two and
          six, inclusive.  The Promotor may set the Maximum Proposal
          Limit to any value in this range at any time by announcing
          the change in the Public Forum; the change takes effect 72
          hours after it is announced.  Until the Promotor sets
          another value, the Maximum Proposal Limit is three.

|     (c) The Promotor shall endeavor to distribute all of the
          Proposals required to be distributed in a given week at one
          time; however, supplemental distributions are permitted only
          within the same week if, for some reason, the previous
          distribution(s) in that week do not exhaust that week's
          Proposal Limit.

|     (d) A message is a Proposal Distribution only if it claims
          explicitly to be so.  The message distributing a Proposal
|         shall set forth its exact text, and should also set forth
|         the identity of its Proposing Entity, and its requested
|         Adoption Index.  Any error in the text of a Proposal as
|         distributed renders its distribution void.  A second or
|         subsequent distribution of a Proposal previously distributed
|         is also void.  An error in any other part of a distribution
|         has no effect on the validity of that distribution.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
          publication shall set forth, for each Proposal then in the
          Proposal Queue, in Queue Order:
|       (1) its Title;
|       (2) its current priority; and
|       (3) the date and time when it was Proposed.

      (b) This publication shall also describe any changes to the
          Priorities of the Proposals in the Queue and the reasons
          therefore.  This publication need not contain the text of
          Proposals in the Queue.

Because you can just remove the Proposal and Propose the amended
version anew.

Andre proposed a scheme to allow in-place amendment, but it was never
distributed.
