"This statement is TRUE" can not logically admit to being either TRUE
or FALSE; it is unavoidably TRUE, and is thus dismissible under
1565(ii).  That aside, it clearly does not pertain to any matter
relevant to the Rules (or indeed to any matter at all) and is thus
dismissible under 1565(iii).

The exceptional statement in the batch ("The Clerk of the Courts is
underpaid", or whatever it is) is, in my opinion, judgeable, but may
be dismissable under 1565(vi).

How else do you propose that Game Custom is to be created?  (Reminds
me of some of the more absurd debates on Ackanomic; at one point it
was suggested that Game Custom be made changable by Proposal.)

I disagree.  Game Custom is not an "all or nothing" the way the Rules
are; there are weak customs, strong customs, and everything
inbetween.  Just because a thing is Game Custom does not mean that
it's strongly-held Game Custom.

Only if you consider that an exclusive or. :-) Obviously, it can 
logically admit to being either TRUE or FALSE, although not 
exclusively.

It appears to pertain to self-reference, which is certainly relevant 
to the rules, :-) not to mention logic, which may or may not have 
anything to do with them. <grins>

Anyways, whether or not the statement is relevant to the rules is 
certainly relevant, since it determines whether a judge should, or 
should not, dismiss it. If it isn't relevant, then it's relevant; if 
it's relevant, then that's relevant. (Now how's *that* for circular, 
er, I mean, convoluted, argument?)

That may or may not be true. Even if it's irrelevant to the rules, 
it's certainly relevant to the situation at hand :-)

Oh, sure - that I have no problem with - *if* there is absolutely no
precedent. (In the case of Vlad's Judgement, there *was* precedent,
in the form of the Win Token debate, but just looking it up has
taken me all this time !)

Mostly the fugitive Blots POs which I claim to be in error as a 
result of the CFJ-940 POs being, well, not POs.

In both cases, because we explicitly legislated against that. Guess 
we need a Rule generalizing the notion to all Moves.

Yes, it's in my next batch of Agora business, which I'm about to post.
I didn't become aware of R1677 until a couple of days ago.

In both cases, the legislation was a clarification of already existing
game custom.

Fair? What has fair got to do with it? We've already had this discussion
over Morendil, Elde and Blob Appealing CFJ 937. It's fine with me...

"This Statement is TRUE." is not unavoidably TRUE. Why can't it be
FALSE? If it's false, then of course "This Statement is TRUE" is false,
but that's exactly what you'd expect; there's no paradoxic involved
as there is with the Liar.

With this I agree.

I don't see why. It should be perfectly possible for the Judge to gather
evidence concerning, for example, what other Officers are paid and how
much work they do for that pay in order to determine whether the CotC
is underpaid. Personally, I think the Statement is false; I think the
*Registrar* is underpaid.

It looks like you're inviting a CFJ when somebody says:

  "This TO is for the sole purpose of satisfying POxxxx.  It is for
   the sole purpose of satisfying POxxxy.  It is for the sole purpose
   of satisfying POxxxz."

...which, while possibly false and possibly even incoherent, might still
technically satisfy your reworded requirement.  Is this a violation of TIA,
or of the phrase "clearly indicates" in the Rule, or is it legal?  I could
see it judged either way.

Hmm, I guess the specific example I had in mind was unrelated (the case
of the IN Proposals that turned into Agora Proposals). You are right
insofar as Proposals and CFJs did appear multiple times in Reports
subsequent to their initial submission before the legislation was
introduced; and these were never taken as additional submissions.

Well, that's a shame, but that shouldn't stop whoever's left of the

As far as I was aware the Plots stuff didn't modify the fundamentals
of the Currency rules at all; it just introduced new mechanisms
whereby Players received goodies.

Using standard mathematics, as Oerjan points out
above, you can then find a time t3 such that t1 < t3 < t2.  So the function
which describes VTs Mintor is discontinuous at t3, no matter how close t1 and
t2 are to each other and VTs are destroyed at t3 since they have no Mintor at
t3.

Maybe I'll have to dig into my text books again (but then, the fact
that this is necessary, and that we're discussing this, already
illustrates that this is not simply a matter of "standard
mathematics") - but I would say that when t2-t1 is infinitesimal no
such time t3 exists.

However, as Morendil pointed out, 1579 states that the currency is not
destroyed at some time (t3 in your notation) after t1, but exactly at
t1. The only way to avoid such a destruction is then not to play with
the meaning of infinitesimal, but to argue that all the rule changes
took effect simultaneously, according to 376.

What you really want (I guess) is not a new playground for scams
involving annotations, but simply a way to make CFJs (and interesting
argumnets from judgements) available in connection with the rules they
refer to.

This could also be achieved if the CFJs were archived in an easily
accessed way, and the rules were simply annotated with a short
reference to all relevant CFJs, like adding an entry "CFJs which
involve this rule: ..." 

This is something the Rulekeepor can already do according to 1681; if
we want to formalize this, we could add such an item to the list of
things to appear in the FLR.

The weakness of this is "if the CFJs were archived in an easily
accessed way" - Vanyel's Archives are very functional, but require ftp
or Web access. On the other hand, mailing a compilation of all or most
CFJs, say, once a month, would be a bit much, too (but note that
making generous use of what Steve suggests would also blow up the size
of the FLR considerably).

Maybe the Archivist (or the CotC) could be required to record all
CFJs, so players can request them as needed via FOIA, 1064? Then a
short list of references to relevant CFJs would be enough in the FLR.

Not so.  My argument in the Appeal of CFJ 932 is sound I believe.
Indulgences were never destroyed by authority of R1586 because the
higher precedence R1435 protected them.  It's just a shame that the VT
and P-note rules have such a high number.

I'd warn against requiring it, though, at least for the moment:
CFJ records are incomplete, AFAIK.

I'm willing to maintain a CFJ archive accessible by mail filter, or
could offer advice to others (Vanyel?) wishing to set up such a system.

I think that the issue is not whether certain instants exist or not
but rather the order in which certain events occur. We have enshrined
in the Ruleset at various points the idea that certain events which
are held to occur simultaneously nevertheless occur in a certain order.

I'm also of the view that R1527 is not relevant here for reasons given
by Kolja, since it's not a question of legally significant notifications
contained in a single message. Furthermore, R376 is not strictly relevant,
since it pertains to the order in which Proposals take effect, not the
order that individual rule changes within a single Proposal take effect.
As far as I can tell (but I've only looked superficially at this time),
the Rules are, surprisingly, silent on the question of what order multiple
rule changes in a single Proposal take effect. Rule 1339 used to say
that they took effect at the same time, in the order they appear in the
Proposal, but that provision was deleted in the Proposal Reform enacted
by P3445. Still, there's probably plenty of game custom that rule
changes take effect in the order they appear in the Proposal, and this
appears to support Morendil's view that VTs were destroyed by P3533.

Just something to think about.

I think that we have in the past assumed that 1527 governs timing of
multiple Rule Changes in multiple Proposals, but the issue you raise
is an interesting as well as an unusally intricate one.

Rule 376 tells us that when several Proposals take effect as a result
of one message from the Assessor, they do so at the same time; Rule 1527
exists precisely to clarify matters of timing, and basically, 376 and
1527 together state that all such Proposals take effect at the same
time, but with infinitesimal separation; IOW, the times t0, t1, t2, etc. at
which the first, second, third Proposals take effect are so close together
that they are undistinguishable from t0. But as I argued that does not
prevent an event occurring simultaneously with t0 from occurring *before*
an event simultaneous with t1.

The matter of multiple Rule Changes in the same Proposal is even
more complex, because no Rule actually tells us when a Rule Change
takes effect; we know that it cannot be earlier than the adoption of
the Proposal, but that's about all. A strong case has been made in
the past that it also could not be earlier than the time the Proposal
takes effect (because that's mostly what 'take effect' means). There
is no reason why it should occur *later*, so let's assume that a Rule
Change takes effect at the same time that the Proposal containing it
takes effect.

Now a Rule Change *is* a "communication in which the Rules place some
legal significance"; see Rule 107, which states that Rule Changes must
be "communicated". It is a little unclear in the context of a Rule
Change what Rule 1527's 'legal fiction' should be taken to mean;
literally, we are told to consider multiple Rule Changes in the same
Proposal to "have been sent sequentially"; but it seems natural to
think that this implies that multiple Rule Changes in the same Proposal
are to take effect "sequentially, separated by infinitesimal increments
of time".

The only question left is, in what order ? As you point out no Rule
requires the Assessor to publish the text of the Adopted Proposals,
only the Voting results, so Rule 1527's provision that they occur
"in the order which they appear in the message" may not apply. Then
again, when the text of the Proposal *does* appear in the message,
any different ordering would violate 1527, wouldn't it ? So I would
argue that in the absence of any other manner of determining the
order in which multiple Rule Changes of any given Proposal take
effect, that order is the same as the order in which they appeared
in the Proposal, whether the Assessor publishes its text or not !

I am not convinced yet that the various rule changes in one adopted
proposal should not occur exactly simultaneously, no ordering or
infinitesimals involved. Where should this ordering come from?

Morendil tried this reasoning:
>>
Rule 1527 exists precisely to clarify matters of timing, and
basically, 376 and 1527 together state that all such Proposals take
effect at the same time, but with infinitesimal separation;
<<

I don't quite agree with the generality of the first part of this
sentence. 1527 refers to the timing of events connected with different
items in one single communication, not to timing issues in general.

Morendil's arguing may still be valid, however I would like to point
out one curious nitpicking point that may demonstrate the
inconsistency of eir position:

>>
such Proposals take effect at the same time, but with infinitesimal
separation; IOW, the times t0, t1, t2, etc. at which the first,
second, third Proposals take effect are so close together that they
are undistinguishable from t0.
<<

That's for various proposals. At the same time, various rule changes
within one proposal also are supposed to take effect in a similarly
ordered way. So let's look at two poposals A and B, each of which
contains two rule changes, A1, A2 and B1, B2 respectively. Proposal A
takes effect at t0, proposal B at t1. Rule change A1 then probably
takes effect at t0, too, and B1 at t1. But what about A2? Does it take
effect before or after t1? The appearance of such a question shows
that something is not quite right here (not to mention the fact that
this is beginning to sound very much like the notorious angels on a
pin...) 

It would be more consistent to consider A1 and A2 as truely
simultaneous. 

Game custom is also cited, by Morendil

<<
and Steve
>>
Still, there's probably plenty of game custom that rule
changes take effect in the order they appear in the Proposal
<<

However, Steve also pointed out that this game custom is based on
rules that no longer exist. Now, which takes precedence: a more
straightforward, less inconsistent reading of the current rules, or
game custom based on rules abolished by now?

Kolja A.

P.S. Even if the timing issue is decided in favor of a solution that
preserves VTs and P-notes across the PC reform, the precise wording of
1579 may still present a problem. 

1579 only says "If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist..." - even
if there is a continuous transition from one mintor to another (as
from the Mint to the Bank in the PC reform), the old mintor at some
point does cease to exist. A new one may be there to replace it, but
unfortunately 1579 does not say "If at some time a currency has no
mintor", focusing on this _state_ of things, it uses the _event_ of
the mintor's ceasing to exist.

The question in the case of a continuous transition from one mintor to
another is then, who is "the" mintor that must cease to exist to
trigger 1579? The old one? The new one?

I deliberately didn't, because I don't like this interpretation of
107. Ok, 107 requires that rule changes must be communicated at some
point. But at the time the proposal is adopted, that act of
communicating is long ago. The message that causes a rule change to
take effect is not the original text of the proposal, but the message
in which the Assessor announces the vote result.

Even if the latter message should contain, as a kind of attachment,
the text of the adopted proposals, I still wouldn't necessarily
include this attachment in the "message" in the sense of 1527.

That's how I read the rules. If game custom says something else (and
is still in accord with the present ruleset), so be it. But from the
rules proper I think the simpler and more consistent reading is the
one with simultaneous rule changes. You veterans may have in the back
of your minds why the ordering of multiple events was introduced, and
read the same ordering concept into all situations where it makes
sense, but I only have access to the rules as written on this
point. And in these I only see timing requirements for rule changes in
376.

I recall creating some Indulgences, but not any P-Notes....

Obviously, if A and B are ordered so that A << B, it must be the case
that An << Bm for any (n,m) (<< meaning "occurs before"), if we take all
Rule Changes in one Proposal to occur simultaneously. Now simultaneity
does not preclude ordering, and *all* we are looking for is a way to
test the hypothesis that for a Proposal P with Rule Changes Pn,
n < m implies Pn << Pm.

The answer to that could be counter-intuitive. All it takes for Game
Custom to govern is that the rules should be unclear or silent on some
issue; commonsense (and, I suppose, consistency as part of commonsense)
takes second place to Game Custom, according to Rule 217.

I take 1579 as stating that a Currency has exactly one Mintor at all
times. A continuous transition causes no problems whatsoever, though
I suspect you may not be using the term 'continuous' in the way I
mean it.

If we had :
R8000 : The King and Prince exist.
R9000 : The Mintor of Zorkmids is the King.
Proposal 5000: Amend R9000, replacing "King" with "Prince".

Then at no time would the Mintor of Zorkmids cease to exist, or
Zorkmids cease to have a Mintor. There would be a discontinuity
in the identity of the Mintor, of course, but no problems with
1579.

Our situation is analogous to :
Proposal 5000': Amend R8000 to "The Prince exists."; amend R9000,
replacing "King" with "Prince".

Well, no, not really. R217 doesn't put those 'other things to consider' 
in any order, and I don't really see how any order is implied.

Well, any statement consisting of a list of items is ordered by
necessity - language is linear. Also, if I say "My favorite foodstuffs
are chocolate, wonderbread and marshmallows", I will usually feel
compelled to add "though not necessarily in that order" if I do
not intend to imply such an ordering - i.e. normal usage is that
when you want to 'flatten' such a list you do so explicitly.

2 Questions.

1. Consistency of judgements

With so many judges, if we all judge independently there will be
various results. Maybe no judgements of FALSE, but at least some
judgements and some dismissals, and dismissals for various reasons. Is
that a problem? Or just a lot of fun?

2. (For Andre): randomness

I'm really curious what randomness generator you have used. I've only
been assigned 1 of the 99 CFJs, so has Steve, while others have been
assigned up to 15. Not that I mind, I'm just curious - some simple
runs I tried with a random number generator on the computer only
_very_ rarely produced more than two players with > 10 and more than
one player with <1 CFJ assignment.

Oh, and in case consistency is a requirement, and we're going to have
some kind of collective judgement, I'm for dismissing the CFJs under
1565 iii) (Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
Rules) - which rule would I possibly want to look up to judge this?

I don't agree with this; there are phrases which make ordering
explicity ("in that order") and which deny ordering ("not necessarily
in that order").  I don't believe that any consistent natural usage
exists, and it is improper to impute either the existence of, or the
lack of, an implicit order solely from the absence of a specific
clause.

Umm, can P-notes exist without a Mintor?  Recall that without VTs, Proposal
3543 must have failed.

Your Judgements will be Appealed.

If many other Judges do similar things, I intend to CFJ that you are
Violating Rule 1565.  Unless, of course, you provide thoughtful arguments
why those Statements should not be dismissed.

Greetings,

This brings up my old argument, which I never felt anybody actually refuted. 
They exist if the Rules say they exist.  The destruction Rule only applies when
a Mintor ceases to exist.  It doesn't prevent a Currency from being defined
without a Mintor.  IMO, the Rules redefined P-Notes after their destruction,
but this time without a Mintor.

Would you? I wouldn't. In fact, with just the slightest overemphasis on 
the first syllable of the last word, I could make the sentence "My 
favorite foods are hamburgers, ribs, and pizza" clearly indicate to a 
native English speaker, and probably to many others as well, that pizza 
was my favorite food. (Not, by the way, that it is. It's up there, 
though.) :)

That's not really too relevant, though, anyway. I really disagree that 
there's a default ordering in a list like that. Here's a distinction: 
you're right in a situation like, "The first three planets from the sun 
are Mercury, Venus, and Earth." In that case, because you are describing 
things which are *already* known as being in a linear order, and because 
you are reinforcing that linear order with the word 'first,' you are 
correct, and few people would list the 3 planets as Venus, Earth, and 
Mercury without a qualifier.

But in this case, or in the case of foods, there's no preexisting order 
or knowledge of an order, and no extra words indicate any such order. In 
fact, if you assume such an order, you are on dangerous ground, because 
there are many possiblities for the way the order is arranged. In your 
example, for all I know you could be listing the foods in order of 
increasing word-length; I don't know why you'd do that, of course, but 
the possibility is there.

The refutation is that we must follow the Rules.  Specifically, Rule 1579,
which says "Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which
must be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority."  What
higher-precedence Rule conflicts with it?

And so they shall, as soon as we get around to passing a proposal that defines
the Mintor properly.  The Rules obligate us to do this in some way, but specify
no time frame within which it must be completed.

Uh-uh. Would you now. I am amazed at how well this 'overemphasis' shines
through in the above mail message, too. ;)

Whatever your intent, the meaning that comes through must be somehow
altered by the fact that you listed one thing first, another second,
yet another third and so on. Whatever you claim, a listener is not
going to interpret "hamburgers, ribs, and pizza" in exactly the same
way as "pizza, ribs, and hamburgers".

I disagree. Even if we regard them as being relevant to the Rules, they
can still not logically admit to either being TRUE or FALSE (dismissal
for reason (ii) in 1565), or if they can (this hangs too much on the meaning
of 'admit' to allow me as a non-native speaker to interpret), then no 
determination can be made of their truth or falsity, triggering reason (vi).

A possibility here would be to use Applications as a second way to
remove such an Annotation. Or maybe even the only way (apart from
Proposals).

Anyone with Nomic experience knows that most Scams are found only when
the thing to be scammed already exists. An Annotation could be there
for a while when someone discovers a loophole in it, and uses that to
scam it.

I would have no problem with it. There would be a problem if they would
establish different Game Customs perhaps, but I don't think these will
establish anything. And if some Judgements are really wrong, in the
opinion of the rest of the players, we can always appeal them.

So, if I were climbing a mountain, and my guide said to me, "Use the 
following items to climb: a rope, a hook, a chisel," then I would have to 
use the rope before I was allowed, under his direction, to use the chisel 
or hook?

(Nitpickers: BTW, I realize that those items do not comprise a typical 
mountain climbing kit. I just picked them out of thin air. :)

Scott couldn't have created any P-Notes or Indulgences, since if my

Yeah, but people generally wait until they're over to propose 
things. 

Not an excuse, anyway, since Murphy's the one proposing it, not
me, and I want to see it proposed as much as you do.

I just meant that it's silly to introduce the Plots if the basics of
the Currencies aren't working, since then the Plots won't work either.

Being listed in an order does not does not create any preference
or precedence for the higher-up items unless such is specifically
stated. I do not have any "preference" as a Player merely because
my nickname comes before yours alphabetically.

Just to warn you: I regard you as not having judged these CFJs, as Rule
1565 says:

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.

You did not do the latter.

same arguments :)

I will not accept this as a valid dismissal.

Rule 1563 states:

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This 'as described elsewhere' apparently points to Rule 1565, which states:

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

I don't think you notified me of the reasons you were dismissing this.
Also your dismissal is illegal according to Rule 1565, although it might
be argued that Rule 1563's higher precedence avoids problems in this case.

No, this falls in under point 1565 (iv) in this case. The problem we have
been having is that there is no clause in 1565 for non-compliance of CFJ
parts other than the Statement itself.

Perhaps, but what significance do such communications have as far
as their adoption is concerned?  Considering that the reprinting
of adopted proposals by the Assessor in the voting results is for
convenience only, and has no legal significance, how exactly
does 1527 apply to multiple changes within a proposal?  I
know you addressed this briefly in an earlier post, but I'm
afraid I didn't follow your reasoning.

One of those fuzzy areas where one persons' "normal usage" differs
from another's.  If I said "My favorite foodstuffs are chocolate,
wonderbread, and marshmallows," I would not mean to imply "in
that order," nor would I assume "in that order" if someone else
said that to me.  My normal usage is to add "in that order" if I
mean that.

!

There's that, of course.   There were what-- 8?  9?  Indulgences in
existence on July 15, not counting the negative ones possessed by Elde.

So we've been trading a severely limited currency without knowing it. Given
this, I'm not sure what the correct Indulgence holdings are now.  Crito?

Am I the only one who misses Rule 1687 ?

I believe this should also be dismissed under 1565(iii).  I know
of no Rule which places any legal significance on whether the COTC
is paid "enough."

I tend to agree with Kolja here.  I note that I have always been
open to any suggestions of unofficial annotations people have.

I'm going to have to do a lot of recalculating to catch up, if CFJ933 is
sustained.  Question.  Am I right in thinking that even though there would have
been more outstanding POs than were recorded in the following weeks, PI
Infractions have to be calculated based on the POs that were actually recorded
at the time, not on the recalculated POs that I will have to figure out when I
correct the game state for Indulgences and P-Notes?

Some food for thought. This may have bearing on CFJ 1045, and so I
humbly solicit comments, rectifications of any errors of fact, etc.

1563 sez :

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

The first sentence states some requirements as to what a CFJ must be.

The second states some prohibitions as to what the Statements of
valid CFJs may *not* be, and further attempts to prevent CFJs not
adhering to these standards from being Judged. It does not actually
place particular requirements on the Statement of a valid CFJ, though 
its first prohibition overlaps the requirement in the first sentence.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

In light of the above, I think that this second paragraph of 1563
can be interpreted to apply to the above first sentence *only*; for
instance, a CFJ concerning a "vacuuous" Statement which fulfills the
requirements of the first sentence of paragraph 1 would not have to
be dismissed - though 1563 should prevent it from being Judged.

Unfortunately, the second sentence is in conflict with other Rules, 
such as 991, to which it loses by virtue of lower Power or higher 
number; such assignment would, in spite of 1563, be assigned a
Judge.

The Antimatter CFJs all contain single, clearly-labeled Statements.
Can they be "determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE" ? Yes.

The sentence "This sentence is a true sentence" could logically
admit to being true, or to being false; it is therefore either true
or false (unlike e.g. "This sentence is a false sentence", which
bears an irreconcilable contradiction). 

Which it is admittedly depends on the sentence's actual truth-value,
but once this is determined, no logicial contradiction arises, and
perfect knowledge presumably includes knowing the truth-value of
that sentence.

As if that wasn't enough, 1563 also doesn't by itself authorize 
Players to dismiss CFJs; it calls upon the dismissal mechanism 
defined in Rule 1565, to which I shall soon turn; but I note at this 
point that 1565 contains the following :

      [...] Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.

If I read 1563's "as defined elsewhere" as conflict-avoiding, which I 
think it is, though by a cat's whiskers, I have to conclude that no 
CFJ can be dismissed under 1563.

(Also note a further problem, in that 1562's requirement that the 
CotC dismiss excess CFJs may be without force for the above reasons.)

IMO the Antimatter CFJs are therefore admissible under 1563.

Are their Statements admissible under 1565 ? Obviously, there are
only two additional provisions under which they could not be, iii)
and vi), i.e. by "not relating to a matter relevant to the Rules", or
by being of such a nature that "after a reasonable effort by the
Judge to obtain all relevant information, no determination can be
made of [their] truth or falsity". 

Provision vi) could be evaded by the Judge Judging the Statements
*before* making any reasonable effort to obtain all relevant
information. In the present instance, this could be done by Judging
more or less at random, such as Zefram did.

The last is iii) - and here we must pause, for while on the face of 
it it appears that the Statements in the Antimatter CFJs are totally 
irrelevant to the Rules, in one important respect the CFJs themselves 
are not. The Judicial Salary for dismissing a CFJ, unless some error 
has crept into my copy of the Ruleset, is 3 Mil. Fat lot of good this 
is going to do any Judge !

Consequently, I tentatively put forward the argument that making a
determination of the truth or falsity of these statements does have 
bearing on a matter governed by the Rules, and that provision iii) 
possibly doesn't apply either.

P.S. I have been reading a-d while composing this, and in more than a
few instances found the issues I had been discussing or pondering
already brought up - don't take the above as implying that these
considerations are original with me, and let me give credit where
credit is due by complimenting Andre on eir sharp eye and mind. And
e sure is underpaid. ;)

Do you know, I once tried to award myself a Win by virtue of listing
myself in a particular document at the top of the list of Players.
Well, it didn't wash, but I'd still argue that Rule 1527 might one
day give someone the opportunity to base a Scam on that.

E.g, suppose we had an ASAP requirement on satisfying POs - that's
plausible, isn't it ? - and a Rule saying that the first Player to
get 100 VTs Wins. If all Players have 99 VTs, the Registrar can 
determine who Wins by issuing POs in a particular order.

No, but you might be naturally inclined to manipulate the rope
first, for instance. And a mountain guide might be expected to list
the items in some particular order : if not of chronological
appearance in the process of climbing, then perhaps of usefulness -
but, and this is crucial to my point, I would expect such a person
to, by the nature of human language, arrange such a list of items in
some order that is *relevant* to the matter being discussed rather
than at random - e would have to go out of eir way to voluntarily 
deprive such a list of a meaning it would otherwise have had.

I am personally inclined to read some meaning into Rule 217's
ordering of the various Judicial criteria that are important enough
to be considered in the Rules, but that may also be because I find
that ordering to reflect what I consider to be the proper ranking of
Judicial criteria. If you count 'commonsense', - a misnomer for what
is actually a rare quality ;) - or past Judgements - recent events
show that this criterion must sometimes be ignored - to be more
important than game custom, I certainly understand that you may not
be so inclined.

Actually, I was incorrect.  Rule 1565 explicitly states that you must give
your reasons for dismissing a CFJ, an area that Rule 1563 defers to other
rules on.  I did not.

If you mean by "recalculated" that some of the POs will turn out not to
have been satisfied, I'd say (unfortunately) that very possibly there may
have been PI infractions based on those.  We repealed Rule 1687, so the
fact the various PO's were recorded as "satisfied" changes nothing.  Rule
1713 says:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which was executed
      more than seven days ago, which has been neither satisfied nor
      vacated, and which is not subject to dispute.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.[...]

Thus, if there was such a PO, the Infraction has happened, even though
everyone at the time thought that the PO was satisfied.

Hey, these "Pragmatic" Currencies are feeling awfully Platonic at the moment!!

Is it possible to interpret "subject to dispute" in a sufficiently broad
manner to cover such POs?  I don't know.  Rule 1733 is very specific about
what a "disputed" PO is, namely one involved in a COE or CFJ.

Can somebody think of a good "pragmatic" way to amend 1713?

Um, as Steve pointed out, a judgement of FALSE is as defensible as
one of TRUE.

I will almost certainly be doing this, and may even appeal those
CFJs which are not so dismissed.

One would think that it would be eir status as Chancellor that would

But can they be _determined_ to be TRUE or FALSE, by logical reasoning?  I
think not.

I can't see any way to read "as defined elsewhere" as conflict-avoiding,
and certainly not as a deferral clause either.  I'd say that 1563 forces
the dismissal, 1565's objections notwithstanding.

True, but that was not what my comment was about: Andre seemed to imply
that your dismissal was illegal for some other reason as well, which I
assumed had to be that the reason was not among the listed ones.

There is a slight pragmatic point in it already: it does not actually
require the Recordkeepor to report the Infraction, which (at least in my
original version) was explicitly intended to give a way out of serious
crises like this.

As long as no one invokes Rule 1509...

You mean, we can all relax until some troublemaker becomes Herald in 1998,
and starts issuing PO's for these infractions.  Comforting!  Can't we have
a statute of limitations or something?

Seriously, I'd like to see an amendment to the effect that if the current
Herald's report lists a PO as satisfied, vacated or disputed then there is
no Persistent Indebtedness with respect to that PO.


>As long as no one invokes Rule 1509...

Do you have any doubt that someone will?  I can hear the slow, mindless
footsteps of the Walking Dead treading over to the Courthouse right now.

Sorry for that last blank message.  My fault.

Rule 1563 says, in part

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

Which has been much discussed of late.  My reading of it is that
"as described elsewhere" refers only to the *procedure* for dismissing
a CFJ (described in R1565), and not the reasons for doing so.  The
situation then becomes a fairly straightforward conflict between
1563 (CFJs must be dismissed for reasons listed in this Rule) and
1565 (CFJs may be dismissed only for reasons listed in this Rule),
which 1563 wins.

Morendil's argument that the CFJ should not be dismissed on the
grounds of 1565(iii) on the basis that the Judgement or Dismissal does
affect the game state is clearly false.  1565(iii) reads:

      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.

Note: "Its *Statement* does not relate to a matter relevant to the
Rules."  *Not* "The CFJ does not relate to a matter relevant to
the Rules," which seems to be the interpretation that Morendil is

Just to disambiguate: I mean to pragmatize the infraction in general, so
that people can always avoid an infraction if the most recent Herald's
Report at the time implies that they're not subject to it.  (On the other
hand, if the Herald's Report incorrectly says that they haven't satisfied a
PO, and they have, then they should still avoid being penalized.)

Not quite, but close. Then again, one can argue that Judging the 
Statement TRUE or FALSE, as opposed to Judging it irrelevant, has a 
noticeable effect on the Game State.

Logical reasoning leads to a determination that they are one or the 
other, i.e. they can be "determined to be either true or false".

Why ? This explicitly calls upon other Rules to determine the valid
procedure for dismissing a CFJ - this is admittedly not the same as
stating that the Rule defers to those other Rules, but arguably a 
construction which seeks to prevent a conflict, or at the very least 
does not assume that a conflict will occur.

I disagree. I think that the second sentence is helping to clarify the 
first sentence, to elucidate what it means to

In other words, a vacuous statement, like the CFJs in question, is "not 
of the sort required by this rule" and therefore must be dismissed.

I don't really count any of them to be more important than others. I was 
happy, recently, that while judging a CFJ recently I had the latitude to 
consider them in the order I wished and to the extent I wished; it 
allowed me to judge the CFJ in the manner I thought best.

There are two reasons why I prefer my approach. Firstly, having a pointer
to relevant CFJs is not the same as having the material in front of
you at all times. But more importantly, the CFJs themselves, at present,
don't always tell you what you want to know. Under the system I'm
proposing, Judges will be able to write an annotation specifically
designed to guide play, quite separately from deciding whether the
Statement they are Judging is TRUE or FALSE.

Looks like Elm has a 'forward folder' command, the shortcut key to 
which must be near the 'quote message' command or something like 
that... ;)

Certainly not.  Rule 1030 requires that a deferral be explicit.

I agree.  It does not assume that a conflict will occur.  But one does.

So suppose I hand in a Judgement of TRUE in CFJ 1045. (I'm rather
swayed by the critics of my arguments opposing dismissal, which
never were that solid to begin with, though I still have my doubts
as to the issue of 1563 conflicting with 1565).

Would it be a good idea - or would Andre, or anyone else,
strenuously object - to Appeal all the dismissals ? After all, the
object of the whole silly exercise is to get VTs in circulation,
which Appealing would achieve. (Of course, in a spirit of fairness
the Justices would have to give the rest of the Playerhood some
guarantee that they would not keep all the loot to themselves !)

And, incidentally, I suppose at this point I should add my standard
I-have-a-weird-one-in the-works warning :

You ain't seen nothing yet...

I agree with this conclusion, although I would not use such complex
argumentation to reach it. I disagree with Morendil that R107 shows
that Rule Changes are communications and that therefore R1527 is
relevant here. The crucial question seems to me to be: do the Rule
Changes in a Proposal take effect as the result of the sending of
a message which contains them? As Kolja has pointed out, the answer
to this question is 'no', and I agree with him that R1527 is not
relevant to the case.

I rely instead simply on the observations that the Rules are silent
on the question of the order in which multiple Rule Changes in a
single Proposal take effect, and that there is very strongly
established game custom that they take effect in the order they
appear in the Proposal.

That's not quite what I said. I said that R1339 used to be explicit
about the order in which multiple rule changes in a single Proposal
took effect, but is no longer, and I observed that game custom is
that multiple rule changes in a single Proposal take effect in the
order in which they appear in the Proposal. But I never claimed that
the game custom was based on the old version of R1339, and in fact
I don't believe that. For one thing, I believe the game custom probably
predates even that old version of R1339, and that that version of R1339
was probably intended to simply to legislate pre-existing game custom.
For another, the game custom has continued even though the old version
of R1339 has been amended. Basically, I believe the game custom in this
case is based on a simple intuitive idea about how such things should
go.

I agree with all of this.

But I disagree with this. To me, claiming that the Rule Changes are
adopted 'simultaneously' doesn't settle anything: I agree that they
are all adopted at the same time, but I claim further, based on strong
game custom, that they are adopted in a particular order.

And 'explicit' in that context essentially means 'conflict-presupposing'; 
i.e.a precedence clause can be worded as 'other Rules notwithstanding'.
The exact wording can be allowed to vary, as long as it is clear that 
the Rule supposed to defer or take precedence is stating "in the case 
of a conflict".

Conflict avoidance is on the other hand a grey zone, and I think that 
we do not yet have a solid framework to deal with, or even recognize, 
instances of that.

You opine that 1563 and 1565 are in conflict when, for example, a
Statement is vacuous. Suppose I am a Judge, and find that a
Statement in a CFJ assigned to me is vacuous. I look up 1563, and
learn that I am to dismiss it. How do I go about that ? Rule 1563
tells me to obey any provisions in other Rules that govern dismissal.
Other Rules, and 1565 in particular, inform me that I may dismiss
only for the reasons stated in 1565. Thus I abide by 1563 by not 
dismissing a CFJ for a reason that is not present in 1565.

Yes, but you're making an illegal jump after that point.

The fact that (P v q), in other words the statement (P or Q), is true 
does NOT imply that either P is true or Q is true.

I don't have particularly strong opinions about this, but allow me to
observe that there is at least one implict ordering in R217: the first
four items are all to be considered *before* other standards. Since the
concept of ordering is already in play in interpret the Rule, it might
be reasonable to extend it to the four items in the list as well.

We just had this discussion with respect to R789. Here, as there,
(perhaps even more so) I think it makes more sense to read R1579 
as defining what it takes to be a Currency, not as imposing a
requirement on the Players to pass a Proposal to make its 
descriptions true.

You don't "Judge" a statement irrelevant.  You can dismiss the
CFJ because its statement is irrelevant, but dismissal is
not a Judgement.

It also allws Judges to write annotations quite unrelated to
the issue being judged.  I'll warn you now that if any
system passed allows (and doesn't discourage) such a thing,
I intend to take advantage of it.

Why not? He gave his reason: R1563.

But that's not the test. The test is whether its Statement relates
to a matter relevant to the Rules. I'm inclined to read 'relevant'
here rather broadly. The Statement has relevance to the question of
what duties the Rules impose on the CotC and other Offices, and what
remuneration the Rules offer em for the performance of these duties
compared to other offices with similar responsibilities. I think the
Statement can be Judged.

No, that can't be right. Their becoming Chancellor is not the change
to the game state that results in its being the case that Proposals
cannot be adopted. Same goes for their being the Chancellor. Only
their decision not to mint VTs makes it impossible, and that decision
is not a change in the game state.

Should they, though?  In this case, and in many which might
otherwise involve continuity problems, it might make more sense
to have all changes take place simultaneously.

Just re-apply the argument: it's the *Statement* that has to be
relevant to the Rules, not the *Judgement* of the Statement, or
the fact of the Statement's being judged.

No, it says you are to "dismiss the CFJ, as described elsewhere."
I'll admit that your interpretation of it is a possible one,
but not, IMO, the most natural one.

In other words, you take "dismiss the CFJ, as described elsewhere,"
to mean "dismiss the CFJ, following the restrictions and by
the methods described elsewhere," while I interpret it
to mean "dismiss the CFJ, by the methods described elsewhere."

Not illegal, just controversial. In classical logic, one can move
from (P v Q) to 'P' or 'Q'. In intuitionistic logic, this move is
blocked.

In any case, I tend to read R1563 as requiring that it be possible
with perfect knowledge to determine either that the Statement is TRUE
or that it is FALSE, not merely that it must be one or the other.

Forewarned, forearmed.

I've been thinking about this issue, and I think all I need to do
is tweak slightly the provisions about removing Annotations 
already in the proto. At the moment, the proto refers to the
situation in which a Player believes that circumstances have 
changed making the annotation irrelevant, as a grounds for the removal
of the annotation. I think I'll broaden this.

But maybe I don't need to - that situation may already be covered
by the general Rules about Appealing Injunctions.

Well, in this case, it might be more *convenient* if they did so,
but I don't know about more intuitive. I have a strong, yet imprecise,
impression that there are numerous Judgements which have deployed
at some point the assumption that multiple rule changes in single
Proposal take place in the order in which they appear in the Proposal.

No, I don't believe it does.  The reverse may be true: what
duties the Rules impose on the CotC and other Offices is relevant
to whether the CotC is paid enough, but whether the CotC is
paid as much as e should be does not affect what eir duties

This makes sense to me, based on the wording of the current Rules.  But it
seems to me, if we agree that all changes in a single proposal are adopted at
the same instant, in a particular order or not, then there is no time at which
VTs did not have a Mintor.  *Then*, as I think Kolja pointed out, the question
is how to interpret "cease to exist", because one of the VTs Mintors (the old
one) *did* cease to exist.  You might get some mileage out of the fact that the
rule says, "If *the* Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist...", instead of "If
*a* Mintor...", since at the time the old Mintor ceased to exist, it was not
*the* Mintor, the new Mintor was *the* Mintor.  This would settle things with
CFJ933 being False.

I agree with you that the Statement has no relevance to how the
Rules should be interpreted, but it does have relevance to matters
with which the Rules are concerned, and since, as I say, I'm inclined
to read 'relevant' reasonably broadly, that's enough to secure
relevance as far as I'm concerned.

This is the kind of situation which my Annotations proto is designed
to address. The Statement has nothing explicitly to do with how R1565
is to be interpreted, yet in order to decide whether to judge it or
dismiss it, a Judge must decide whether to read 'relevant' narrowly
or broadly in R1565, and their Judgement should probably set a precedent.
Under my new Annotations proto, the Judge would be permitted to issue
an Injunction to Annotate R1565 with an explanation of the issues
surrounding the interpretation of the word 'relevant' in that Rule
and how that interpretation affected eir decision to dismiss or not
to dismiss.

For the sake of argument, let's bracket out the worries about the fact
R1579 doesn't - but really ought to - say that "If a Currency ceases
to have a Mintor with the authority to be the Mintor for that
Currency, then all units of that Currency are destroyed and the
Currency ceases to exist." Suppose it did say that. What should we
conclude on the further hypothesis that the rule changes in P3533
took place simultaneously but in the order they appear in the Proposal?

Logical argument: since VTs ceased to have a Mintor before they were
reassigned one, the condition in R1579 is met and VTs were destroyed.
I think this is the best formulation of Morendil's argument to the
truth of CFJ 933, because it doesn't rely on any reference to instants
of time and their existence and hence avoids the complications ensuing
ifrom the temporal argument given below. Ie, it's a logical argument
from the satisfaction of conditions, not a temporal argument about
exactly *when* (ie at which instant of time) the condition is satisfied.

Temporal argument: in order for a condition to be satisfied, there
must be an instant of time at which it is true. Is there an instant of
time at which VTs have no Mintor? Now things get complicated. How short
can an instant of time be? Can it have infinitesimal or even zero length?
If so, then the logical argument given above gets rephrased as "there is 
an infinitesimal instant of time between the instant at which VTs
cease to have a Mintor and the instant at which they once again have
a Mintor, and so the condition in R1579 is met and VTs are destroyed."
But one can deny that instants of time can have infinitesimal length,
and insist instead that, say, nothing shorter than a second can count
as an instant of time for legal purposes. Now, since VTs lose and
then regain a Mintor all within the same instant of time (understood
this way), there is no instant at which VTs do not have a Mintor, and
the CFJ is false.

Now, personally, I prefer to avoid the entanglements of the temporal
argument and stick with the logical argumentm on which the CFJ is
TRUE. If I'm forced to worry about instants of time, then I claim
that there's plenty of game custom that instants of time can have
infinitesimal length, and the CFJ is still true.

I disagree again; I don't think it makes any difference. If a judge wants 
to take it that way, fine; I just don't think there's any reasonable way 
to claim that weighing all standards listed therein equally is a 
violation of the rule.

I'd like to solicit comments on Crito's CFJ 944:

>======================================================================
>                               CFJ 944
>
>For proposals distributed during the infection of R693, the ten days

>
>======================================================================

It seems to me there are two issues here.  First, does the
prohibition on retroactive Rule Changes in R108 apply only
to the direct effects of Rule Changes--that is, changing the
Rules themselves--or does it aply to indirect effects as well?
In other words, would a Rule which was enacted on Sept. 23 (by
a Proposal passing at that time) which said "Chuck had 100 VTs
on Sept. 20" be prohibited from taking effect by R108?  It seems
to me that this latter way is the way we've always read it in
the past, but I don't know if the issue has ever come up
in a CFJ, and the narrower reading does seem a reasonable one.

Second, even if 108 does prohibit indirect retroactive effects,
would the case be described in this CFJ be such a prohibited
effect?  Consider Crito's argument:

>The disinfection of
>R693 can be seen as assigning an historical significance to the ten days
>following the distribution of each of these proposals.  It is like passing a
>rule now which says, "September 1, 1997 through September 7, 1997 shall be
>known as 'The Week of the Cumberbuns'".  

Crito goes on to say (roughly) that this would be an allowed, indirect
retroactive effect, but I'm not even sure that is true.  What is wrong
with saying, "Before Sept. 23, the week of Sept. 1 did not have any
special designation; on and after Sept. 23, the week of Sept. 1
was known as "The Week of the Cumberbuns'"?  I'm separating here
any effects which would happen during TWOTC, which would be an
indirect retroactive effect, from the mere designation of that
period as TWOTC, which seems to me would not be retroactive.

Something I've got buried away in an "ideas" folder:

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

This privileges Officer's Reports with respect to the things they
report upon.  Adding to that a requirement that an Infraction not
imposed because of an reasonably informed belief that no Infraction
existed shall not be imposed at a later date if that belief proves to
be wrong should be sufficient.  I think I would want to distinguish
whether the mistaken belief that no Infraction exists arises from a
mistaken belief in a matter of fact or a mistaken belief in a matter
of law, however; the latter should afford no protection.

Another, more trivial option, is to impose a statute of limitations on
the reporting of Infractions, to be tolled only when deliberate deceit
to avoid the report is involved.

Reminds me of a selection from _Law and the Modern Mind_ (by Jerome
Frank) I read recently on the nature of judging.  Judges come to a
conclusion of what the "right" decision is, and then seek a
justification for their decision afterwards.

I am not in the least convinced, however, that this mean that there
was a constructible "moment in time" where VTs failed to have a
Mintor.  I also note that Rule 1586 states "When the Rules ... are
amended".  Not "Rule". Since a single Rule Change can only affect one
Rule at a time, I am inclined to interpret the Continuity Principle as
applying to Proposals as a whole (or to batches of simultaneous
non-Proposed Rule Changes as a whole, if such things existed).  Since
VTs had a proper Mintor both before and after the application of 3533,
I am inclined to judge that VTs did not fail to exist.
