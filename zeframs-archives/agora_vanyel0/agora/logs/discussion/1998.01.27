First, you've got "be changed" in there twice.

Second, wouldn't this throw everything back into Platonic confusion again?  If 
someone interpreted the rules such that an action was legal but it was later 
judged not to be in accordance with the rules, you'd have to go back and 
re-compute the game state, since the Properties were never actually changed 
after all... and this might make other, later actions now illegal, requiring 
additional recomputation, etc.

Is there someplace else in the rules further defining this?  If not, then 
Player A and Player B could each transfer currency to the other, indicating 
clearly that these Transfer Orders are being executed to pay their Maintenance 
Fees, and thus get off scott free.

Is this sufficient to prevent players from creating or changing a Blueprint to 
make its associated Structure produce a rule-defined currency?

Subject:	BUS: Proposal:  Plots

I submit this Proposal and pay its Petition Fee.


Proposal:  Plots


[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

All Locations are destroyed.

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially 
owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      A Plot's owner may give the Plot to any other consenting entity.

[Bank-owned Plots are traded by the Chancellor on its behalf.]

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  
Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 
9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude 
for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the 
Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  All Structures 
are
      initially owned by the Bank.

      Each Structure is either assigned to a specific Plot, or unassigned.  
All
      Structures are initially unassigned.

      An unassigned Structure's owner may assign it to a Plot by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so, unless another Structure is already 
assigned
      to that Plot.

      An assigned Structure's owner may make it unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.  The owner of a Plot with a Structure
      assigned to it may also make that Structure unassigned by informing the
      Cartographor that e does so.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 5 P-Notes, and 15 Ergs to that
      Player.  In addition, e shall order the Cartographor to create 5
      Structures and give them to the Player; the Cartographor shall do so as
      soon as possible after being so ordered.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.  For each Player, 5 VTs, 5
P-Notes, and 15 Ergs are created in that Player's possession.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  All Structures are initially Idle, and any
      unassigned Structures become Idle if they are not already Idle.

      An assigned Structure's owner may change its Type by informing the
      Cartographor and paying the new Type's price to the Bank (if the new 
Type
      is defined by the Rules) or the Maintainer of the new Type's Blueprint
      (otherwise).

      As soon as possible after a Structure's Type changes, the Cartographor
      shall execute a Payment Order for half the old Type's price (rounded 
down)
      to the Structure's owner, from the Bank (if the old Type is defined by 
the
      Rules) or the Maintainer of the old Type's Blueprint (otherwise).

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      Each Structure has a Maintenance Fee that becomes due at the beginning 
of
      each month.  When due, the Maintenance Fee for a Structure is paid when 
an
      entity successfully executes a Transfer Order for the amount of that
      Structure's Maintenance Fee, provided that e indicates clearly that the
      Transfer Order is being executed to pay the Maintenance Fee for that
      Structure.

      One week after a Structure's Maintenance Fee becomes due, if it has not
      yet been paid, then it becomes delinquent.  As soon as possible after 
this
      happens, the Cartographor shall destroy that Structure.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the
      Cartographor shall report the Production of all Structures.

      When the Cartographor reports the Production of a Structure for a given
      Nomic Week, a number of units of the appropriate Currency are created in
      the possession of the owner of the Plot to which the Structure is
      assigned.

      Churches have no Production.  However, each Church is considered to be 
two
      players for the purpose of randomly allocating Indulgences, and any
      Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is instead given to
      its owner.

      Only one Vatican may exist at any time, and it is always owned by the
      Bank.  Its Production is a number of Indulgences equal to the number of
      Blots issued and not vacated during the previous Nomic Week.

A Structure is assigned to Area 42 and becomes the Vatican.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      A Type of Structure exists only if it is specifically defined in the 
Rules
      or in a Blueprint.

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type         Price      Production   Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Idle         none       none         none
        Farm         4 Ergs     2 VTs        1 Erg
        House        4 Ergs     1 P-Note     1 Erg
        Mine         4 Ergs     1 Erg        1 Erg
        Church       4 Ergs     none         1 Erg
        Vatican      none       special      3 Ergs

Create a new Rule titled "Design of Blueprints" and this text:

      A Currency not Minted by the Bank may be associated with a type of SLC
      known as a Blueprint.  A Blueprint indicates the properties of a 
Structure
      that produces units of the Currency associated with the Blueprint.  The
      Blueprint's Maintainer is the Mintor of the associated Currency.

      A Blueprint can only be created through an Application to Create a
      Blueprint. Such an Application must contain the following information:

        * The name of the Type of Structure defined by the Blueprint.
        * The type and amount of Currency produced by this Type.
        * Any changes to the amount of Currency produced by this Type due to 
its
            Adjacencies to other Structures.
        * The Price of this Type.
        * The Maintenance Fee of this Type.

      The Maintainer of a Blueprint may change its text by posting the changes
      to the Public Forum, and indicating what Blueprint is being changed. 
Such
      changes may only take effect if the new text of the Blueprint would 
still
      define each of the properties of the Type listed above.

[This allows multiple Blueprints per non-Rule-defined Currency.]

Create a new Rule titled "Interaction of Structures" and this text:

      Two Structures are Adjacent if and only if they are assigned to Adjacent
      Plots.

      A Farm's Production is increased by 0.5 VT for each House or Church to
      which it is Adjacent, and decreased by 0.5 VT for each Mine to which it 
is
      Adjacent.

      A House's Production is increased by 1 P-Note for every 2 Farms or Mines
      to which it is Adjacent.


[Part Four:  Remove other Currency inputs; make P-Notes useful]


Amend Rule 1471 ("Creation and Destruction of Currencies") by replacing the
text reading:

       New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
       Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
       that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
       number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
       added to the Mintor's possessions.

with the text:

       New units of a Currency can only be created by an assigned
       Structure of the appropriate Type to produce that Currency,
       as described in other Rules. 

Rename Rule 1763 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank II") to "Intentional
Transfers to the Bank") and amend it to read:

       If an Entity transfers Currency to the Bank and specifies a 
       purpose for this transfer, and the transfer succeeds in
       accomplishing that purpose, the Bank shall, as soon as possible,
       destroy that Currency. 

[Rules 1754 ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") and Rule 1763 currently have
  identical text.]

Repeal Rule 1684 ("VT Supply").

Amend Rule 1623 ("Disinterested Proposals") to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if it is clearly labelled as such by its
      Proposer.  If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Amend Rule 1753 ("Repeal-O-Matic") by replacing "submitted its Proposal
concerning a given Rule" with "submitted its Proposal concerning a given Rule,
and paid the Petition Fee for that Proposal,".

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week, the Assessor
      shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player who submitted a Proposal
      which was adopted during the previous Week.


Amend Rule 1702 ("Petition Fee for Proposals") by appending this paragraph:

      All Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Proposal shall be adopted
      unless its Proposal Fee is paid by the end of its voting period.


[Part Five:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a 
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a 
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures 
since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the 
last
            Report


[Part Six:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player 
who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

I believe so. A Blueprint may only define properties for a Structure that
produces units of the Currency that is associated with the Blueprint; only
non-Bank-minted currencies may be associated with Blueprints.

Congratulations! Do you get to have a pithy slogan like your predecessor
did? :)

>and thinks her Nomic experience should stand her in good stead...)

Indeed. Some of the issues you have to deal with are eerily similar. (I
think you could take some of the Agora rules discussion posts, change a few
words, and pass them off as M:tG rules discussion posts, without anyone
being the wiser. :)

No, you're right.  Sigh.  Care to Propose a fix?

  Swann's Frankenstein Monster proposal gave me a thought: what would
you all think of an anti-Repeal-O-Matic, that would automically revive
1-3 defeated/repealed proposals each week?  This could be fun, if
there was a safeguard that only proposals more than two months old
were eligible (to ensure proposals just defeated wouldn't be
reversed).  Would there be any support for this idea?

I'm slightly against this.  I think you mean that old defeated proposals will
automatically be resubmitted as new proposals (I don't know what you mean by a
"repealed" proposal).  This forces us to maintain records for defeated
proposals (I assume you will put an upper limit on the age of potential
revivals, otherwise I'm very against it) which could otherwise be discarded. 
If Players want to change their minds about an old defeat, they can always
resubmit it anyway.  At least the Son of Frankenstein submits something new.

No, Tom Wylie has moved out of the Magic group entirely.  (He was splitting 
his time between Magic and other stuff, and as the time requirements grew, 
Magic got squeezed -- that's why we've had a shortage of official rulings for 
the past few months.)

So, another Magic-playing Agoran, eh?  I still find the parallels between some 
of the MTG-L and Agora discussions entertaining.

(BTW, I laughed for nearly a minute when I read your "slip" about the 
Gardnerian turbo-whatever-it-was.)
