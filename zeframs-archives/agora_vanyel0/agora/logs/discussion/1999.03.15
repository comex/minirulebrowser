Perhaps this Proposal ought to be called "The Agoran Pyramid
Scheme". As it is, Soldiers get paid for doing nothing. That's
a good deal. And once the hierarchy gets set, there is little
that can be done to shake it up except "assassinate" your
superior (by getting em elected Speaker) or replacing the
CinC. So you'd get the officers banding together for
protection against the privates. That may be what is desired,
but then the proposal might better be called "The Agora Mob".
  It might be more interesting to have two armies, and have
rules for conflict. At least give the soldiers something to do.
Or we could arrange invasions of other Nomics.
  We might add incentive to being a Civilian by requiring them
to pay the army, but depriving the Soldiers of voting rights.
Make it more of a trade-off. 
  Or have Soldiers that are not Players, but Nomic entities. 
Soldiers could be hired to defend one's possessions or to attack
those of others. Poor Players would have to band together to
defend against Players with large armies. You might call this
"Agoran Mercenaries". Players would be At War or At Peace.
A Player would have to be At Peace to earn income (War costs 
money, you know). A Player would have to be At War to attack
another Player (not to defend, though). Still, we'd have to
have a safeguard against one Player becoming Warlord. One
idea would be to have defeated Players go to the Stockade,
where they would be safe from attack (and prohibited from
attacking out). Players in the Stockade would only be able
to earn so much however (enough to hire a few soldiers).
Then if one Player drove all the rest into the Stockade, they
could recoup their strength and strike back when necessary.
Dealing with a coalition might be more difficult, but one
strategy would be to wait in the Stockade until they went
bankrupt paying for their armies. I think the situation would
be balanced. This is the sort of thing I might support.

Not true. They get paid for being willing to accept the Duty 
to Vote on every batch of proposals. If they fail to vote, then
pretty soon they will no longer be in the Army.

Well thanks for the constructive criticism.

Strangely enough I'm not at all interested in making rules for
conflict. I proposed this as an experiment in formalised 
hierarchy, choosing the Army as a nice example. Actually, I'd 
rather continue in the vein of the Duty to Vote, and give them
other "Public Service" jobs. Perhaps the higher-level Officers
could also have a Duty to Propose.

Are you saying, Blob, that you will only vote for Players who promise
not to execute scams? That seems to me quite contrary to the spirit of
the game, and very boring, too. I certainly will make no such promise.

I'm saying, tho it seems you are all too dense to notice, that I will be
Speaker in about two weeks and... well you can use your imagination for 
the rest. :)

        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order

            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Why not choose the civil service as a model then? In many states the
civilian offices have tended to imitate military ones, at least in
terms of rank, nomenclature, even to the extent of having uniforms.
The late Roman government comes to mind.
 But it will boil down to fundamental economics. Either the money
coming in exceeds that of the cost of the duties, or it doesn't. If
it does, everybody becomes a soldier (or almost), otherwise not. You
might as well pay Players for performing public services directly.
I don't see the merit in a hierarchical organization, unless, of
course, I am at the top of the hierarchy.

          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the

            of Organizational Agent to the Notary, setting forth the
            current name of the Organization and its new Agent;

        (3) by Judicial Order, when the Rules permit such an Order to
            issue.

      (e) No person shall be made the Agent of an Organization without
          eir consent.  Any person who submits a Notice of Change of
          Organizational Agent certifies under penalty of

      (a) A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
          the following requirements:
        (1) it has been posted to the Public Forum;
        (2) it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of
            Policy";
        (3) it specifies, by name, an Office to which it pertains; and
        (4) that Office is held by its author.

      (b) Once posted in accordance with subdivision (a) of this Rule,
          a Statement of Policy is binding upon the Player who issued
          it for as long as it remains in force.

      (c) An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
          Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.
          Further, any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever
          the Office it pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it
          constrains.

      (d) Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of
          Policy, a Class 2 Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document.

      (b) A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
          belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
          its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when
          that entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
          executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
          submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will
          (excepting those which e cannot execute or cannot execute
          successfully, for whatever reason), and will then divide the
          remaining residual assets as provided by the Will.

      (c) A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an
          Application to Create a Will.  Such an Application must
          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

I like the idea of having players able to do things besides make
proposals and declare rebellions. However, as pointed out, the idea of
the army as presented is strictly an economic game. Now, if it paid
P-Notes or Kudos, then it could have potential. Paying VTs for using
more VTs is either a good deal or a bad deal, but if you get paid 2
P-Notes but are forced to spend an extra 3 VT in Voting Tariffs, is that
a good deal or not? That question is the basis of economy.

Something like:

The Commanding Officer of a Soldier leaving the army must appoint a
successor from eir subordinates. This process is repeated until there
are no gaps.

(obviously not formal or precise, but you get the idea)


If you are going to implement this, I would make some suggestions:

1. Allow salaries to be anything, not just VTs
2. Allow competing armies: which is the better deal for you?
3. Allow armies more leeway to regulate eir soldiers. For example, army
A can require its soldiers to have -no- blots at all or face discharge,
while army B can allow up to 8 blots. Army C requires a soldier to vote
ABSTAIN on at least 25% of proposals, etc.

Protoproposal Chaos50 [rev. 5]

Some Housecleaning

Be it resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.
