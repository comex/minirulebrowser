Oh, but this means that all the players who've devoted their entire life to
complaining about Tom Wylie's style will have to find a new ridiculous
thing to whine about! (Or, they could just start playing Battletech. :)

Not to swell your head or anything, but I actually expect that people will
be much happier with the Rules with you in charge. (As long as my Humility
cancels out my opponent's Empyrial Armor, *I'm* happy... :)

The most eerie parallel I've seen was last year, when we were arguing over
whether Pragmatic Currencies had destroyed all units of Currency. The
discussion was incredibly close to the "Maro vs. Wheel of Fortune" issue
(although the final ruling in Agora was the opposite of the ruling in
Magic...)

Probably not. I would be willing to limit this so that it merely reverses
our current practice with respect to periodic actions.  Something like this:

ProtoProposal
Time Requirements (v. 2)

Create a Rule with the text:

      If a Rule requires a player to perform an action at a particular
      time, the Rule shall be interpreted as requiring the action to be
      performed within a reasonable period after that time.  This Rule
      takes precedence over such a Rule.

      A "reasonable period" shall be at most 7 days unless a Rule sets
      a different time period, or unless the action was impossible during
      the specified time period.

      If a Rule authorizes and requires a player to perform an action at
      the beginning of a nomic week, then the player is authorized and
      required to perform that action during that week. This Rule takes
      precedence over such a Rule.

      If a Rule authorizes a player to perform a specific kind of action
      during each Nomic week or at the beginning of each Nomic week, then
      a player failing to perform that action during that week is not
      thereby authorized to perform that action at a later time, unless
      so provided by the Rules.  This Rule takes precedence over such a
      Rule.

I've got a small box full of cards (mostly 4th ed, IA, Alliances). I'm
always enthusiastic when I see new game concepts, and Magic certainly
was one. But the frequency with which new expansions, rule changes etc
were published is too high for occasional play, so I gave up following
the scene and buying cards soon after I started. It's really a
fullblown hobby now, not just another game. And hobbies, well, if
collecting things is involved, I need some kind of brake mechanism to
stop me from ruining myself, so I collect only things that need
additional work before you can buy more, like metal miniatures that
have to be painted, and the like.

As far as rules debates go, well, in nomic they are fun, and one of
the points of the game. But when the debates are trigerred not by
interesting issues, but by the shear complexity of the rule system, I
don't enjoy them so much. I'm not saying that is the case with MtG;
but for Agora I think this is the difference between interesting
debates (how to implement an economy, or a pragmatic currency system,
or a workable probate code etc) and red tape problems (like catching
up with unimportant details of the game state, or locations, P-notes
and other potentially interesting concepts that aren't implemented
properly, or zefram's famous white elephants).

Sounds like fun, but I'm afraid it has a lot of white elephant
potential (I'm beginning to like this phrase). If it produces
controversial proposals that might make a difference to the game,
they'll probably be voted down. If it creates proposals that basically
don't do anything particularly exciting, they might be accepted, but
what for? 

The old FM was killed just after it began to make a difference,
because it was found that we can create enough trouble to keep us busy
all by ourselves, so there is no need for additional automatic or
semiautomatic mechanisms to create work. (The R-O-M is an exception,
because it forces us to try things we need, but can't bring ourselves
to propose voluntarily: killing useless old rules we have grown
accustomed to).

I wouldn't want to be Mad Scientist, doing uneffective work under a
policy like the one Oerjan tried to announce to save the old FM. So I
probably won't vote for this.

Hmpfh.  Who says it would have been ineffective?  I only promised not to
create unreasonably large amounts of work.

I didn't intend to ridicule your plans - it's more a general
impression I have, that we tend to avoid random/automated/
semiautomated effects if they do anything but create moderate amounts
of harmless paperwork. 

Maybe your announced MS policy, and the FM in general, isn't the best
example for this. The virus certainly was: As soon as it started to
infect vital rules, it was proposed to upmutate these rules to protect
them from the virus. Essentially this would have made the virus
useless, so abolishing it altogether was the more consistent choice.

No offence against the last Mad Scientist was intended!

This is probably true.  If this is really going to be appealed, it would be
kind of the appellants to do it soon, otherwise the PO will be vacated
after Harlequin's 10 VTs have been taken away by "Real VT scarcity *now*"...

Or perhaps the appelate court could use its discretion to avoid making the
order at that point...

I would like to remind the Registrar that he is permitted to vacate those
VTs anyhow, and now that it has been determined that they were not
required, he does not need to reorder them.

I guess so.

No, I don't think the Registrar has to do anything about such an
Injunction.  The Assessor may however need to make a reversing PO, as the
Recordkeepor of Voting Tokens.

Assessor Scott claims it makes his job much easier, which is presumably 
one reason why he Proposed the system to start with.
