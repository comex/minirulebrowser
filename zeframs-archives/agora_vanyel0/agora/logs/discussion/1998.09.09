But, doing it the way you described, the second is *not* a random choice.
The second is a choice based entirely on the result of the first choice. I
cannot see any way in which this could be defended as "random."

Note, however, that Michael addressed the issue of the eligibility of
a Player who registered after the time the CFJ was called as an
intermediate step to reaching the final holding in that CFJ.  Since
the intermediate conclusion is essential to the final holding, it is
part of the ratio decendi, and therefore has weight as precedent.

You're right that CFJ 1046 does not directly address the question of
whether a person who is not registered to play at the time a CFJ is
called, but is registered to play when the CFJ is assigned, is eligible
to Judge that CFJ. Nevertheless, if you read Judge Michael's reasoning,
you will see that he relied on anwering that precise question in order
to reach his Judgement in CFJ 1046. I regard that as sufficient to set a
precedent that R911 is to be interpreted such that only (but not all)
persons registered as Players when a CFJ is called are eligible to Judge
that CFJ.

An interesting first day's play for you, Proglet!

I may have misread the CFJ, (I have deleted it, so I can't refer back 
to it), but I didn't think Michael resolved that issue at all. The reason
why the player in question was ineligible to be Justice was because e
was not an Active Player _at the time the first judge was selected_.
I don't remember it saying anything about whether e was registered at
the time the CFJ was made.

Could someone please send me the CFJ text again?

You may have a point. Here's the relevant part of Michael's Judgement:

      Here we come to our next problem: when the CFJ was first assigned,
      Calabresi was not a Player.  The rules do not explicitly discuss
      the eligibility status of non-Players, so we have to turn to
      common-sense and game custom to tell us that non-Players are not
      eligible as Judges. (The language of the Judge selection rule
      (R951) tells us that Judges are to be selected from amongst
      eligible Players, not necessarily implying that other classes of
      people are ineligible. However, here the common-sense view of what
      it is to be eligible must be appealed to, if it is impossible for
      one to be selected for something because of one's status, this is
      equivalent to being ineligible.)

      Therefore Calabresi is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the
      appeal of CFJ 933.

Since Proglet was registered at the time the CFJ was assigned, that may be
enough to ensure he was eligible to serve as Judge. AFter all, we have
the precedent of lee's selection to Judge CFJ 1100, which was assigned
about 2 months after it was called.

I'll leave it to Michael to consider the merits of my COE.

Isn't the relevant part the bit just before this? Ie:

        In fact the wording of the relevant rules makes it clear the
        eligibility is an attribute that should only be calculated 
        when a CFJ is assigned a Judge.  
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Doesn't that mean that you should consider only Proglet's Activity at
the time of selection, not at the time the CFJ was made?

Which rule governs re-assignment of CFJs anyhow? I'm going rule-blind.

You're not going blind; there is no Rule which deals specially with
re-assignment. Instead, you have to go to Rule 408, the general Rule
about assignment:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of
      infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and
      the Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

I've prepared a somewhat prettified version of lee's Report, which
corrects some of the grosser format mangling to which it has been
subjected in the course of transmission, and which should make it a
little easier to see what's going on.

I've a few comments for lee, mostly about formatting:

1. You need to make sure your name fields are wide enough to accomodate
Player's names. 'Harlequin' is a 9 letter word, and 'Antimatter' has 10,
so an 8 letter field width is not enough.

2. Since ideally, you want all the information about any particular PO
to fit on one line, and since 75 characters isn't much space, it's
important to be economical. I think your date and time fields take up
far too much space. In my prettified version, I deleted all year
information, for instance, saving 5 characters. You don't need AM/PM
information if you express times as 24 hour times. And there are more
economical ways to express months. Thus,

Sept. 8, 1998   01:49:32 PM   could become
08-09-98 13:49:32             or 
08 Sep 13:49:32               or even
08-09 13:49:32 

saving as much as 12 characters per line while maintaining reasonable
readability.

3. In the Outstanding POs section, you list a number of POs with their
original Assessor labels of the form 'aaannn'. Most or all of these
would have been given a new Accountor label of the form VTPOnnnn by
former Heralds Crito and Blob, which may account for your not being able
to match up Transfer Orders satisfying them. I know in my own case that
I am very conscientious about satisfying POs, and usually do so as soon
as I issue them (since most VT POs naming Players as Payors are issued
by the Assessor for voting). I doubt that I actually have any
outstanding POs for VTs, and I'll do my best to track down the messages
from the Archives in which the POs you list as outstanding were
satisfied.

4. You need to add Proglet to you database.

5. What is the entry for 'mbc'?

Oh sure.  I was really just wondering whether or not the penalties for
a failed rebellion were steep enough.  Or perhaps the rewards
(penalties) for a successful (unsuccessful) revolt should be inversely
proportional (proportional) to the chance of success.

H. Accountor,

It's nice to see the report published. 

Like Steve, I am nearly sure that I always paid my voting POs right
after they were issued, but it will take some work to prove it.

Could you be so kind and only report us poor sinners for persistent
indebtedness once, not once for every week that passed since the last
Accountor's report? I would much appreciate this.

Kolja A.

This report seems quite out of whack. I have checked it against my
records for the time that I was Accountor, and it would seem that I,
among other players, have been charged twice for voting costs. Also,
a number of POs, for which I have fulfilling TOs on file, are still
recorded as unfulfilled (and I did pass all my records on to lee.)

Probably we are now in such a position that completely recovering the
state of play is impossible, but I will not agree to have this report
ratified, when it so strongly disadvantages me.

How are we going to fix this? I'd recommend we restart with a level
playing field, if nobody objects. I realise that some people will be
disadvantaged by this (and others, like me, will benefit), but I am
not willing to leave it like it is, and I can see no fair way to 
bring it back into line.

PS: I am not trying to blame Lee. I dropped em in a difficult position,
which quickly became an impossible one.

I would love to do it that way.  As long as the Rules support it, I
will.  Any other opinions on whether it is legal for me to do so?

Ok, i will try for a smaller date field.  Warning, I an a Merkian and
my program may just spit them out in MM-DD-YY.  I will try for the more
logical format.

Is it ok if i keep their original PO tags from now on?  It makes it
much easier for me to track.  I do think that many of the payments for
VTxxxx were meant to satisfy aaannn, but i am at a loss on how to match
them up.  Any suggestions? This is part of what took forever.  I
finally just gave up. I am at a loss.

It's a spread sheet and I already have hem there.  He has received a
new Player award.

Master Builder Contest.

I really appreciate your comments.  I hope others step in and make
suggestions if something is bothering them about the report. I did not
realize i was going for a 75 column report.  I will keep that in mind. 
This reminds me of my days of programming in COBOL.

I will try, but i think my program will choke on this form.  I will be

I am quite willing to try to fix the report.  If you could be so kind

I will go through the report tonight and look for more pairs like this.
 Michael is probably correct in that they are the same PO.  I will post
the results.  May be everyone's debt will not be so high or so late! 
This is precisely why i would rather keep the original PO# and not
reassign it one of my own.
Can anyone tell me a definitive way to tell which PO pairs are really
the same PO?

Silly me, what is the date of the newest ruleset? I had recently saved
one that I thought was new, but obviously is not.

As far as I can tell, there exists no general duty to report Infractions.

In fact I cannot find any remains of the old Rule that allowed other
Players to use the court system to report Infractions when the authorized
Player refuses to do it.

Hmm, that's good. Means RKs and other Officers can now take bribes not to 
report offenders. :)

If there was a duty to report Infractions, a judicial Motion and Order
to Compel would be available for that purpose.  Since, as you note,
there is no such duty, there is no mechanism.  I leave it to the
polity to decide whether this is appropriate.

You don't need that, although it might be a bit awkward to use these

I think we will be able to cope with MM-DD-YY if that is the result.

Well, 75 columns can be quoted twice without breaking, but as long as it
is 79 or less at least the original will look good, unless your mailer
autowraps at less.

In an emergency I suppose you might split each row into two parts.

Except that the rules treat it as 2 choices each between 2 options.

Likewise, one might argue that Michael's determination of the
result of the recent revolt was a choice between two possible
outcomes: success, with probability 10/17; and failure, with
probability 7/17.  Except this would be wrong, because the Rules
explicitly require that he choose an integer between 1 and 17
with equal probability.

There's no "first" or "second."  I'm suggesting the two selection
be made simultaneously.  (If they are not made simultaneously,
you are right that the second is not random, since you know what
the outcome will be before you make the selection.)

Nope, you have the most recently published Ruleset--but you have
to check Proposal results that have been published since then, too.
I haven't yet published a Ruleset which incorporates Proposals
3787-3788.

The repeals are very recent - last Monday in fact. I'm not sure if Chuck
has issued a new Ruleset since then.

In view of recent statements from the Pumpkin Patch, perhaps we ought
to reconsider our diplomaitc status with respect to them?

H. Accountor lee,

I've looked into my own case to begin with. You list 5 Outstanding POs
naming me as Payor.

Let's take them 1 at a time.

1. aaa267. VT2595 in the Satisfied list corresponds to this one.

2. VT2689. This corresponds to aaa284 in the Satisfied list. Now, I paid
aaa284 for a second time a few days ago (on Sep. 8, as your records
show) after you told me that my first attempt was a failure due to
insufficient funds. However, I suspect that my funds only appeared to
be insufficient because you have listed many Salary POs as Outstanding,
when in fact I'm sure they were paid by Chancellor Michael. He can
probably help you identify the messages in which the payments were made.
They usually have Subject lines like "Bank Transactions". At any rate,
my feeling is that your final Report will show that my original attempt
was a success.

3. VT2722. Corresponds to aaa296.

4. VT2787. Corresponds to aaa303.

5. aaa312. Record of payment seems to be missing. But I definitely paid
it. Unfortunately, I don't seem to be able to access the Archives at the
moment so I can't prove it yet.

Also:

You have a repeated entry for aaa284 in the Satisfied list. This is 
one of the POs I paid just a few days ago after you told me that my
original attempt had been a failure due to insufficient funds. The other
one seems to have gone missing from your Report. In any case, it may be
that my original attempts were successful after all, once the facts
Salaries were in fact paid has been taken into account.

Hope this helps.

The site from which Michael got his data has a reference to a paper
by Eduardo Ley called "On the Peculiar Distribution of Stock Market
Indeces' [sic] Digits", which I've downloaded and read. I'm still
digesting it. But it does contain a reference to a paper by Benford
(1938) called "The Law of Anomalous Numbers". Apparently, Benford
noticed that the beginnings of tables of logs in libraries were always
much dirtier than the ends, and he hypothesised that this could only be
true because people have much more cause to look up the logs of numbers
beginning with a 1 than they do numbers beginning with a 9. His Law of
Anomalous Numbers formalizes this as:

The probability f(i) that a random decimal number begins with the digit
i is log ((i+1)/i), for i = 1,2,...9.

This means that the probability that a number begins with a '1' is about
24%, while the probability that it begins with a '9' is only about 4%.
Benford investigated many different kinds of tables of numbers,
including the lengths and surface areas of 353 rivers, the street
addresses of the first 342 entries in _American Men of Science_, the
specific heat and molecular weight of thousands of chemical compounds,
and found many such tables with numbers obeying his Law.

Weird, eh?

I'm not prepared to give up so easily. Things are not as bad as they
seem. I believe that once the duplicate POs are sorted out, and the
situation with the many Salary POs which lee has listed as Outstanding
is clarified, that matters will be much clearer. I think we eventually
will be left with a Ratifiable Report.

MM-DD-YY should be fine. I was using it myself as Wizard.

I think this episode has shown the danger of relabelling. We should
probably adopt a universal labelling style across of Offices, eg:

OOVTPnnnn

where 'OO' is a 2 character filed identifying the Officer issuing the
PO. So instead of 'aaa312', the Assessor would issue AsVTP0312. I won't
be Assessor much longer as I won't be renominating for the Office, but
I'll switch to this style as of now, and I encourage other Officers,
particularly the Registrar to do likewise.

No, he hasn't. Registrar Michael has issued a PO, but Chancellor Michael
has not yet paid it.

That's an interesting point which I hadn't considered. Perhaps you
should make a CFJ?

I noticed that a number of the timestamps on POs and the like do not
seem to correspond with the dates on the messages in my records. Are you
perhaps using the timestamps from when you received the messages, rather
than when they were sent? I believe we have a judicial precedent which
says that messages are effective as of the 'sent' timestamp.

PS: Could you also please convert times to GMT? It'd make life easier
and it's more in keeping with the times defined in the rules.

I'm happy enough with the Judgement, but I think Judge Blob's reasoning
is a bit quick. I agree that commonsense indicates that if someone
counts as two Rebellious Players, they should count as two Players. But
for what purposes? Clearly not, for example, for the purposes of
determining how many votes they may cast. What about for the purposes of
counting how many Players there are when the success of Revolt is to be
determined by the Registrar? R1837/1 does not explicitly *say* that the
Miscreant should count as two Players for that purpose, in the way that
it does explicitly say that the Miscreant should count as two Rebellious
Players for the purposes of counting how many Rebellious Players there
are. Of course it's not unreasonable to think that R1837/1 implies this,
which is why I'm not unhappy with the Judgement. But I think Judge Blob
could just have reasonably insisted that since R1837/1 does not
explicitly say that the Miscreant counts as two Players for the purpose
of counting how many Players there are at the time of a Revolt, the
reference to the number of Players in R1664 should be taking as having
its ordinary meaning, unaffected by R1837. In this case, I don't think
it's commonsense that settles the issue, but merely the Judge's
preferences.

On a separate but related note: I'd like to see Judges using their
powers to Order the Rulekeepor to Annotate Rules more often. It seems to
me that our best chance of keeping track of how past Judgements affect
the ongoing interpretation of various Rules is to incorporate references
to those Judgements into the Ruleset, where they won't be forgotten.
Relying on the memories of veteran Players is too haphazard. R1079
should have a reference to CFJ 790, for instance. In the present case,
R1837 should be annotated with a reference to the Judgement, and a copy
of the Statement.

I always thought that this was because people started reading at the
beginning, but got bored and never got to the end. Which is a shame,
because while the beginning is admittedly a bit slow, the plot really
starts to pick up around the fives and sixes. I was riveted. :)

Well, he's using a spreadsheet, so correcting errors shouldn't be nearly
as difficult as doing the original set up and data entry.

Jokes aside, Benford's orginal starting point struck me as dubious as
well: there might be all kinds of reasons other than his hypothesis why
books of log tables in libraries are dirtier at the beginning that at
the end. What's more difficult to dismiss are the discoveries of many
different tables of numbers whose first digits appear in distributions
roughly according to his law. The reference to specific heats and
molecular weights of chemical compunds is especially intriguing. 

But here's a speculative hypothesis of my own: when we measure
quantities, we choose 'sensible' units, ie, we choose units such that
typical examples of the quantities being measured will be small,
manageable numbers, like those between 1-20. It's convenient to do so,
because such numbers are easy to remember, and we can do arithmetic for
these numbers in our heads, and so on. This might account for Benford's
Law in the cases cited by Ley (street numbers, specific heats and
molecular weights, lengths and surface areas of rivers).

This hypothesis is testable, of course. All you have to do is to see
whether the various quantities continue to have first digits distributed
according to Benford's Law when those quantities are redescribed using
other, less sensible units. (Of course you can't do that for street
numbers, but you can do it for specific heat, chemical weight, length,
surface area, and other physical magnitudes).
