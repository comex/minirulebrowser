Grumble grumble....my own fault, of course, for not paying closer
attention.  It seems I am again in need of an Indulgence, for
which I am willing to pay 1.5 P-Notes.

I don't see that it would be worth while trying to get an ordinary 
proposal passed to make that change.  So surely this has to be a case 
where Summary adoption is useful?

Actually, although I took the position you hold above in the discussion to which

Protoproposal Chaos82 [rev. 4]

Freshen 1796

Be it resolved, that Rule 1796 be amended to read:

      (a) All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules
          for their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable.

      (b) In order for a Judge to find an Order invalid, the Judge
          must find that:
        (1) the Order was executed by a Player who the Rules did not
            permit to execute it;
        (2) the Order was executed in circumstances that neither
            required not permitted the execution of that Order; or
        (3) the Order has been rendered invalid by another Order or by
            the Rules.

      (c) A Judge who finds, during the course of judging a CFJ, that
          an Order is invalid shall vacate that Order, unless it has
          already been vacated.

      (d) Nothing in any Order shall act to prevent or hinder judicial
          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has
          this effect is void and without force, all other Rules
          notwithstanding.

I'm surprise that you didn't attempt to adopt this summarily.
