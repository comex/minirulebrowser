That was me. IIRC, someone (actually, two people) got a Nobel Prize 
in economics for work which had among its results the 'second 
highest bid' system.

Why it works: If you can buy the item at option and then immediately 
sell it for price X (or otherwise get X value), then:
* If you bid low, you might not get the item when bidding X would 
have given it to you, giving you no profit instead of a small one.
* If you bid high, then you could end up paying more than you can 
benefit, giving you a loss instead of breaking even.
Thus, the best results for the bidders come from bidding accurately, 
which gives the seller the best price.

Or how about this instead: You must pay 1 P-Note to submit your proposal to the
queue. New entries then start with priority 1. A proposal may only be distributed
if priority rises to 2 or more. A proposal is removed from the queue if the
priority drops to (or below) 0. I would say priority drops by 0.5 weekly so that
the proposal is gone in 2 weeks if not supported with more P-Notes.

What happens if the Promotor fails to distribute a batch in a week
when one is required?  Does e publish two the following week?

Hmmm. Does anyone know how is the first bid handled, if no one else bids?
Does that bidder pay *their* bid, or nothing?

Or, as is more likely, to force the failure of more Proposals due to lack
of Quorum. We tried this once before, right after changing over to the "pay
for Votes" paradigm, with disastrous results -- almost no one could get a
proposal passed, because no one would vote on it.

I think probably the best solution would be one that does both...

Actually, now that I have read your latest proto, I don't think this is needed,
as long as the ultra-pragmatists don't have a problem with the decrementing or
discretionary incrementing being done offline by the Promotor.

As Promotor, I will include a list of discarded proposals in the report, but it
is probably not necessary to make this a requirement.

I think they should be penalised for committing the Infraction of
<whatever>, but I don't think they should play catch-up.  Either they
do it in the course of the week, or they don't. 

I really disliked the interpretation of similar situations to this
which had people dealing with a perceived backlog (e.g. Oerjan's big
spate of FM reports).  

Blob, loth as I am to delay this, I'd say that it does need specifying
before the final version is proposed.

As long as the Promotor makes note of the changes on eir records and
reports on those changes in eir next report (i.e. explain why a
Proposal's priority has changed).  I don't see a "pragmatic" problem
because the Promotor is reporting to emself.  A wording acceptable to
me for the decrementation would be along the lines of "As soon as
possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Promotor shall
decrement by one the priority of every Proposal in the Queue which has
been on the queue for more than one week."  This, coupled with a
requirement to include in the report all changes to the Priority of a
Proposal and the reason for the change, should suffice.

     But couldn't someone bid an outrageously high number and get
away with a low payment?
     For example:
      The starting bid is 5 VT for the indenture of Morendil.  G.
Chaos bids 6 VT.  Crito bids 50 VT.  Now, if there are no other
bidders, Crito will get to purchase the indenture for 6 VT because
that was the second highest bid.
     Of course, someone else could continue the bidding process, but
then e would have to pay at least 50 VT for Morendil (not that it
wouldn't be worth it, Morendil ;-) ).

I admit I haven't really looked at the proto in question, but
my understanding is that a winner-pays-second-highest system
was for use in an auction with sealed bids.

I believe you are correct.  It makes no sense to use it in an auction
with open bidding.

No, this has to be done with silent (private) bidding, so you don't 
know that someone else doesn't have the same idea.

The best thing seems to be to redo the auction. Paying nothing is 
certainly out of the question.
