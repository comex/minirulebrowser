  Fellow Agorans, I ask for your support today in my bid
to become Commander-in-Chief in Agora.
  It is a dangerous world out there. Once we were alone,
or virtually so, in the Nomic universe. But today there
are many new faces out there--some friendly, most
harmless, but a few harboring dark and dreadful plans to
disturb our little community.
  Don't we have enough concerns here? Shall we sit idly
by while other, more energetic Nomics work to undermine
our long tradition? Don't you deserve a level of security
befitting your status as honored elders of the Agoraverse?
Of course you do.
  As Commander-in-Chief, my first priority will be to submit
for your approval a comprehensive plan for the defense of
Agora from any unwanted incursions, and the organizational
prerequisites for successful counterattack, should that 
become necessary. True, in these carefree times the signs
of future danger are dim and seemingly far-off. But I know
you have the wisdom to look beyond present comfort and lay the
ground for future security.
   I am proud to be part of a community with a strong democratic
tradition. That is why I have enetered my name in nomination
for this office. Join with me, and together we can build a
better Agora.

Vlad

P.S. Those requiring additional persuasion should contact me
privately.

Ah, I like that. I forgot about the precedence aspect based on rule
numbers - 991 is the more general definition, so common sense would
give precedence to 991. But now, (1) is an option again. 

Of course, there _is_ the same problem as with the "must" in the old
Kudo transfer rule: if 789's requirement doesn't hold, the CFJ may
cease to be one, or it may remain one and violate 789 (in which case
a penalty according to 1439 might apply).

The idea of ownable real estate (which might produce income) is not
without merit.  However, I am dubious of the merits of personal

To be honest, I don't think I would vote for proposals that extend the

it would be a bit silly for me to coauthor and then not support the

Antimatter is not a very interesting Zombie, though;
e can't be reregistered until the end of the month.

Not up to me, though - it's Murphy who decides who
ends up as a Zombie. But I'll be sure to wring a chicken's

It claims that the existence of Overdue Payment Orders for Currency X with Player Y as Payor at 
the beginning of Nomic Week Z is the cause of the Infraction.

I see no basis for this assertion. Read the text of the Rule carefully. It refers to all OPOs at 
a very specific moment in time: the beginning of the Nomic Week. The history of previous 
commissions of this Infraction is irrelevant to the commission of it at this given time, on the 
given Nomic Week.

Who keeps track of this? The Assessor? Or does the Cartographor have to use eir records to match 
the time of voting with the time spent in the Voting Booth? Yuk.

Also, note the wording of the relevant section of R1503:

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

This seems, to me, to refer to the specific penalized actions, and not the general category 
"penalized actions." That is, it states that each penalized action shall be classified as either 
a Crime or Infraction. Read that way, it doesn't seem to define anything about Crimes or 
Infractions other than that certain penalized actions may be one or the other.

Heh. I was going to suggest this, but I was afraid someone would shoot me down. :) Just as an 
example, look at what we refer to as "redefinition"; i.e., using a term with a RL meaning for a 
different meaning *within the context of Agora.* What else is this, but the creation of a legal 
fiction that the term means something other than its usual meaning?

Failing to move one's car from the parking space in the allotted time?

So we get rid of the Agoraverse, and institute the Plots proto from way back. (Of course, both
the authors of said Proto are either deregistered or undead, so...) This seems like the way to go 
-- retain the Cartographor and the idea of ownable land, while getting rid of some of the 
Agoraverse silliness.

Hmmm. Could Vlad please tell us why e believes e would make a good CinC? For myself, I think for 
good or ill my performance in the position stands for itself. Do note that we *did* have a 
victory of sorts over Rishon during my stint as CinC, although this admittedly had as much to do 
with poor construction of the Rishon rules as with our actions.

That is IMHO precisely why a Rule redefining a term defined by another
Rule (*as opposed* to redefining a natural term) is a more delicate
matter : in that case we have two Rules attempting to establish two
different - and therefore possibly conflicting - legal fictions.

Hmm, on this side of the ocean you get a new slip of paper stuck under
your windshield at most once every two hours for staying parked in a
no-park zone. (That is, if it's not a zone where you get towed away
instead; that usually means staying parked in a paying parking area.)

You can refer to them as that - my question was, does some federal,
state, municipal or other statute actually state that you are subject
to a fine for 'failing to move your car from a restricted parking
area' rather than 'parking your car in a restricted area'.

Not that it matters, at least not for proposal voting; since I am
subscribed to agora-discussion, I will receive the messages in
question, which is sufficient to satisfy the criteria for voting.

It may be worded 'failing to move your car before the legal time limit has
expired' or 'parking in a space longer than the legal time limit' but in both
cases the cause of the infraction is a failure to act.  Also there are
definitely statutes dealing with failing to put money in a parking meter, which
is clearly a failure to act.

Hmm, I'd agree in the first case, but argue that the second is an 
act, rather than a failure to act - not that it matters much, since 
we're straying veeery far from the point of this little exercise,
which was, if you'll recall, that whoever-it-was wanted to refute my 
claims about Double Jeopardy and Rule 1503 by arguing that you can 
get fined mutliple times for parking offenses, which arguably has 
very little to do with being subject to multiple, a single, or no 
Blot penalties for Persistent Indebtedness.

Again, I'm not concerned here with the principle of the thing - I 
could hardly care less about parking offenses as they relate to
Agora. ;)

I'm still lurking around here - and taking quite an amused interest in 
what my reanimated corpse has been doing while my spirit has been absent. 
Morendil beware - I've got my eye on you.

If people are seriously considering trying out something like the Plots
proto, I might be interested in returning and hshing it out. It wouldn't
take much - just to iron out a few bugs, and to translate it all into
Pragmatic Currency speak. Anyone wanna help me in that?
