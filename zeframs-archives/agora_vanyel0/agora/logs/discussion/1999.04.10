Scott, since I began Objecting, you have falsely accused me of
hypocrisy, falsely claimed that I am the richest Player in the game,
falsely asserted that I oppose Summary Adoption in order to maintain a
personal fief, and called me a jerk. (The truth of the last claim I will
have to leave to others to judge, but it's certainly an insult.)

Can you produce evidence of similar such behaviour on my part?

The truth or falsity of those claims is a matter of opinion.  I still
believe that you are hypocritical, and that you are opposing SA in
order to maintain a personal power bloc.  I also believe that you are
being a jerk insofar as that you are pretending that the two foregoing 
claims are somehow objectively false.

Protoposal        "Don't Object"


Create a rule titled "The Protestor" with the following text.

Let there exist a Unique Patent Title know as "The Protestor".  The 
Protestor shall not object to any attempts to adopt proposals without 
objection.

The Patent Title of The Protestor is always held by the last player 
who was given that title in an election as described in the rest of 
this rule.  

At the start of every month there is an election for the title of The 
Protestor, every active player except for the last player who held the 
title of The Protestor is a Candidate for this election.  Quorum does 
not affect the result of this election, a candidate must win the 
election.
