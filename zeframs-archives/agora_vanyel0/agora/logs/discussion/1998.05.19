Proto: Empower the Ambassador
<<

I'm sorry for replying so late. I think such a reduction of player
participation in IN affairs would be a sort of last resort to keep our
IN participation alive if players were completely disinterested. As it
is, they are not, and the quorum requirement for IN referenda does
succeed to involve players, at least enough to briefly check out the
proposals and declare presence.

As long as that works and we don't have to abstain from IN votes too
often because our internal referenda fail quorum I think we should
keep the current rules.

BTW, at the moment a much more severe problem for IN is the inactivity
of the moderator, but while I don't have much time to do something
about this, I think dealing with this, finding a way to replace
inactive officers etc is a classic task for young nomics, so why
shouldn't we go ahead, face that crisis and enjoy it (maybe that is
even what Uri wants to happen...).

Proto-Proposal
Remove Mint Authority from Players
[snip]
Worth doing? What do people think?
<<

Yes, let's do this. Another white elephant...

Irises, and the notary's recent roblems, won't go away then, however,
because Irises are minted by the Order of the Evil Eye. And while I
would support moves to limit the usefulness of contests that only
require one player to get started, I'm not so sure I want to limit the
rights of groups, at least not those with three or more members.

Steve,

Looks like it's working fine now.  It seems that
the "mrb" address, which is the one we are
supposed to use, is just an alias for the "rmv"
address, to which it gets changed, apparently.

Thanks,
Crito

Messages from you have had some trouble getting
through.
Are you sending from a completely different
address to the
one you're subscribed from? I have you subscribed
at 
<dalbertz@mrb.state.ma.us>. I have turned on the
'mungedomain'
option, so messages from rmv.state.ma.us should
get through
now.

Hopefully the problem is now fixed. Please try
sending some
mail to the lists and see if you receive it.

I quote:

Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      negative quantity of Currency.  Transfers shall be noted on the
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

This would seem to indicate that I am at least allowed to disallow such
transfers.  It's true that it doesn't really require me to ignore them, but I
think there is strong Game Custom that establishes an interpretation on this
preventing me from allowing transfers that result in negative holdings.

Apparently the problem is not fixed after all - this message
and 7 others from you were all trapped as non-member submissions
and had to be manually approved by me. Would it be a good idea
for you to subscribe to the lists under the mrb address?

Twenty five Proposals in the Queue! Perhaps we should give the Promotor
some latitude to choose Batch Sizes larger than 6?

I would think that once you make the decision to abide by an order,
you should not be allowed to reconsider that decision.  After all, you
did note the transfer on the records.  "Unnoting" it would be an
unpermitted change to the records.

Where did the Threat's VTs go? I don't remember us spending any...
There is no record in the list of POs below of any transfer being 
made. 

On a related note, I wish to offer 2 P-Notes for sale, for 2 VTs each,
and I want to suggest that someone fix the unemployment benefits ASAP.

No, because only 5 of them have Priority greater than zero. The others 
would not get distributed anyway.

The only reason my Proposals have Priority 0 is that I haven't enough
P-Notes to increase their Priorities!

Ooohh... indecision. I don't want P3748 to pass, but I don't want to spend
the VTs. I'd be willing to spend one, but not two. But just spending one
would be a waste unless I knew someone else was also going to spend one.
Would Swann or Murphy be able spare me a VT to vote against it?

Well, I'll sell you 2 P-Notes (or spend them on your proposals) for 2 VTs
each.

BTW: I think your previous payment for my P-Notes spent on your proposals
was vacated. Could you try it again?

A good idea, in my opinion. I like the way that players have a choice
between being a private landholder and having a job with the government.

I think that Plots will also need tunable parameters along the line of
the "Levers" proposal. Give the Cartographer some power to tune production
rates. (Interestingly enough, as the Cartographer is an Officer, e would
not hold any Plots, and so could not directly influence eir own income.)
This could cause some interesting interaction between the Cartogrpaher
and the Chancellor.
