Fixed the bug spotted by Murphy.

Proto-Proposal
Amend Me If You Can

Be it therefore resolved that the following Rule, entitled "Amend Me
If You Can", be Created with MI=4:

      This Rule shall not be changed, that is, amended, repealed,
      Mutated, or subject to any other Rule Change of a kind defined
      by the Rules, under any circumstances, except as specifically
      provided for in this Rule. Such changes shall, for the purposes
      of this Rule, be taken specifically to include changes in the
      Number and/or Title of this Rule. This Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which would permit such a change to take place.

      Furthermore, no Rule shall have any effects which has a higher
      Mutability Index than this Rule, and this Rule takes precedence
      over any Rule which would permit such a Rule to have any effects.

      This Rule explicitly claims the right to determine its
      precedence relations to other Rules according to its own
      provisions, and it takes precedence over any other Rules which
      seek to determine the precedence relations of this Rule in any
      other manner.

      Upon being Created, this Rule immediately and automatically
      renumbers itself. Its new Number is 100. Immediately after
      that, this paragraph automatically deletes itself.

      This Rule automatically Repeals both itself, and the Rule entitled
      "The 'Amend Me If You Can' Competition", on April 1, 1998.

Be it further resolved that the following Rule, entitled "The 'Amend Me
If You Can' Competition", be Created:

      The first Player to make a Proposal whose adoption results in 
      the Rule "Amend Me If You Can" being Amended, Repealed or
      Mutated, shall win the game.

But if we vote against it, none of the provisions will take effect,
and you won't get to see anything. On the other hand, if it passes,
I don't see anything too interesting occurring. We have a straightforward
amendment to R1586, followed by a null provision which I guess would have
no effect of any kind.

Personally, I won't be wasting a vote on it either way.

Proto-Proposal
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor - tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping - into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]
