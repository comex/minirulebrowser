Having the Bank create inflation by pouring money into circulation,
while simultaneously seeking to limit it by drawing it out through
taxation, seems silly to me.  Better to do neither.

Depends on how we spell it. I reckon jewel sounds good, inaccurate, but

We probably have the means to start a circus.
We have players who can do juggling (offices, titles, votes, proposals, etc.)
We have acrobatic types (jumping to conclusions, rolling (ofl), backflips, et
al).
We have a few lions (I've heard a few roars).
We have a magic act (Wizard).
We probably have more clowns than we need.
I have no doubt we could find a ringmaster (makes a lot of noise, but doesn't
actually do anything).
Applications for positions of tightrope walker, contortionist, high-dive act,
human cannonball, dancing horses (will mules do ?), elephants, performing dogs,
and knife thrower are all welcome.

Seriously though (hahaha), expressions of interest in the formation of the
"Agoran Comedy Troupe - Uplifting Players" (ACT-UP) are now called for. I'm
sure we could have some fun with this idea. The silly person would be a member
of course. Who needs monsters, viruses (virii ?), and other depressing things
(although, I reiterate here that I LIKED the virus) (btw in case you hadn't
noticed, I like brackets, sometimes I'm sure that my main text should be in

Nothing personal, Blob.  8)  Even though I tend to agree with your judgement, I think the single insistence of the
wrongdoer should always be sufficient grounds for appealling a CFJ against em.  But since the Rules wouldn't
allow it, in this case, I thought I would help facilitate Morendil's request for appeal.

I agree with this, but it might be better left for a modifying 
proposal made after Plots resolves, since currency reform is a 
seperate (and possibly objectionable to some) issue.

Each new player gets some number of Ergs (currently 12, I believe), 
and each current proposal gets that many when the proposal passes.

Without obtaining extra Mules, 25 VTs per week, minus those needed to 
trade for 6 Ergs per month (probably about a week's production) and 
the interest on the Erg loan which allowed those Houses/Farms to be 
built in the first place :-)

And the rest of the group gets miffed, I suppose.

A few remarks on auctions in general.

First, public auctions are generally more fun, and can generate a 
higher profit due to bidding wars (particularly in the case of 
Auctions to Indenture).

Second, if you really want a private auction, the auctioned item will 
fetch a higher price if the winning bidder only has to pay the 
_second_-highest bid. In that case, a bit of thought shows that each 
bidder's best interests are in placing the most accurate bid 
possible, instead of bidding low in hopes of getting a deal.

Third, there's an interesting public auction variant in which both 
the highest bidder and second highest bidder have to pay their 
bids... the inventor got interesting results in auctioning off a 
dollar bill :-)

Plots seeks to curb inflation by introducing ways of spending 
currency which are rewarding to one person, while resulting in a net 
loss -- Churches and mixed Structure types.

5 VTs per Plot per week, ignoring Adjacency with other Players' Plots.  (Any
bonus for Adjacency to one's own Houses or Churches is dwarfed by the option
of building more Farms on those Plots.)
