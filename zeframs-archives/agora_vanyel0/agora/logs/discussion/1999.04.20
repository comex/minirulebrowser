Two questions:

Can someone (besides Steve) confirm that the original message was
sent to a-b?

If so, would you send me the *entire* message?

(I tried the egroups archive, but it doesn't seem to want to recognize
me as a "member" of a-b.)

Thanks,
Chuck

Yep, it sits quietly in my "spam" folder... had he tried it a few months
ago, I would probably have discovered it while preparing my spam
complaint, but alas my spam fighting has greatly deteriorated lately.

Will do so separately.

I actually read the whole thing, but when I got to the end I didn't
think to confirm that there wasn't something appended.

Thanks for Morendil and Oerjan for forwarding me Steve's spam.
I believe that Steve is guilty of Misrepresentation for the forged
email address (I checked, and email to janet9981@yahoo.com bounced),
and possibly for the claims made in the email itself.  I'll submit
a CFJ tonight.

I would tend to agree.  I might also suggest that Steve did not
succeed in his little ploy because it is not obvious that the original
message was in fact submitted by him.  In any case, no Player should
be permitted to benefit in any way for sending falsified email.

In any case, I now consider Steve to be a Criminal of the worst sort
because he has violated one of the deepest and most necessary trusts
of Agora.  Agora cannot survive if Players routinely send forged
emails.  It is very easy to falsify email messages in all sorts of
strange and interesting ways, ways that if routinely exercised would
require every Player to scrutinize every message for evidence of
fraud, making the game tedious and unenjoyable.  

Steve may have opened the Pandora's Box that will be the death of
Agora.  He should be sanctioned appropriately.  Vlad's proposal of a
six-month banishment is definitely appropriate; I would hold that it
does not go far enough.
