============================================================

ProtoProposal Chuck110
Public Presence

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.

Rule 1741 shall be amended by adding the following paragraph:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the announcing
      of Presence by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Public Forum.

The above paragraph shall be added immediately above the following
paragraph:

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

if such a paragraph exists in Rule 1741, or at the end of the
Rule, if no such paragraph exists in Rule 1741.

[Comment: the point of Public Voting is so that people know what
the outcome of a vote will be, and whether their actions might
affect that.  This isn't completely the case if we have private
Presence.]

You misread my argument. I do no appeal to intention. I argue that at the
time there was a single entity, whose existence was well known to all
Liasions, and who was also a non-voting member of Internomic to which it
could have refered, and that is why the reference is a clear reference to
the nomic of which I am Speaker. I am appealing to 'when proposals take
effect'.  
No real ambiguity existed before that other nomic appeared.

Sorry.  I've been far more busy than ever I expected to be.  I still
do have all the logs; I continue to have difficulty getting them all
up for download, but I'll do my best to make an orderly transfer o'

Are you sure?

The Frankenstein Rule says:

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

Thus, an SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monster.

But Andre's Frankenstein Contest says:

Regulations:
1. Andre is this Contest's Contestmaster and its Frankenstein Monster. No 
   Player may become a Contestant. There is no Contest Fee.
2. The Contestmaster may spend the Contest's Currency as he wishes.
3. The Contest dissolves when the Contestmaster so decides. However, no
   such dissolution may take place if the Contest Fund contains any
   Currencies.

Hmmm... Maybe this doesn't work, as I should be the Regulations' Frankenstein
Monster instead of the Contest's...

I think not, since implicit delayed Transfer Orders are described in other
Rules.  It may not be clear anymore exactly what a Transfer Order *is*
(although it seems pretty clear from the implications provided by the
uninfected Rules and the natural meaning of the words), but R1731 clearly
provides whatever basis we need to say that the procedure in R1442 can be
carried out.

Clarity of intent does not imply clarity of effect.  You *are* still
appealing to 'intention of the framers', you're just pointing out that
that intention is clear.

If a proposal to create a rule reading "Any member nomic who <insert some
really spiffy service to InterNomic here> gains -5 points" is adopted, do
you take the apparent intent ("gains 5 points") or the literal reading?

It can be a fine line.  If the Assessor *doesn't* say "Morendil has Voted
FOR Proposal 4000" - when e did Vote FOR it in the PF - then it can be
determined that Morendil did something else privately, though not exactly
what else e did.

Has the Referendum on INP 353 begun yet?  I don't recall seeing
an announcment from the Ambassador, but since I now more or less
see all IN business three times (once on the IN list, once in
Agora, and once in New Rishonnomic), I may have not noticed it.

 I already explained why this is not an argument for intent, and the only
thing you seem to be saying is 'is too' :)

A literal reading of the typoed proposal would have prodcued no effect at
all, as was pointed out on both these lists, due to the misspeling of the
