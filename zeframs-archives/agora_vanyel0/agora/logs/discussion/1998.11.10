Awww... you're no fun. Just because no one uses them... 
I think they're kinda neat.

If I ever deregister, I'm going to grant my Power of Attorney to a
suitable player. 

In fact, I think I'll proto:

---

Protoproposal Blob24601 [rev. 1]

Create a rule, entitled "The Slave Markets", with the following text:

      If a player deregisters without granting eir Power of Attorney
      to another, or if e is deregistered due to Silence or Lawlessness,
      then e becomes a Slave, and is the property of the Bank.

      At the beginning of each week, the Registrar shall conduct an
      Auction for any Slaves currently owned by the Bank. The Player
      who makes the winning bid shall transfer the amount of eir bid
      to the Bank, and shall then receive ownership of the Slave.

      A Player has Power of Attorney for every Slave in eir posession.

Doh.  I saw that I was due some from the latest Indulgence
distribution, but forgot that I actually had to act on those as
Chancellor.

The way I understand these rules it is registered players (only9 who
can grant power of attorney. I think this also messes up your proto,
much as I like the general idea. BTW, if you follow up the slave
trading idea for deregistered players (Zombies, anyone ;) you'll have
to allow slaves to be freed when their original player reregisters.

Protoproposal Chaos66 [rev. 1]

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]

Rename it to "in a timely fashion".  Retain ASAP as a subclass of IATF with
higher Tardiness penalties, if there are any cases for which the implied
urgency is appropriate.

How about formalizing these definitions, then adding "All obligations are
persistent unless the rules say otherwise" and "Publication of an Official
Report is a non-persistent obligation"?

More Cleanups

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1048 be amended to read:

      (a) A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an
          existing Category to which the new Rule will be assigned. 
          If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's
          Category.  When doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new
          Rule Category and assign the Rule to this new Category.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees
          fit.

      (c) If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must
          announce it in the Public Forum no later than the first
          subsequent publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      (d) The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
          Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
          Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
          Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a
          Rule Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their
          Category.  Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is
          decided by the Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories
          must be listed, even if no Rules are currently assigned to
          the Category.

      (b) The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        (1) The Rule Number
        (2) The Rule's Amendment Number
        (3) The Rule's Power
        (4) The Rule's Title
        (5) The Rule's text
        (6) Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

      (c) The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
          additional information in the SLR, except that which
          increases the readability of the SLR.

      (d) There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
          Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
          same Category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.
          The FLR must contain all the information required to be in
          the SLR, as well as:
        (1) A brief description of each Category
        (2) Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
            required to record.

      (e) The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
          which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in
          the FLR.

Proposal of the Week

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity submitting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of submission that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undstributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Cleanup of R.1445

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which

            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is

        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating the e wished to
            retract eir Nomination.

            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time

            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

hmm, i just made a transfer order of 5vts to the bank for the purpose 
of buying 4 plots.


Can someone please tell me:
1)Whether this will succeed (or if it will not because my estate 
has? my 5 VTs)?
2)When exactly do I become owner of the plots?
3)if my plan with the cunningness of Baldrick is the most 
blatently obvious attempt to make a win ever.
4)Whether transferring 0 VTs to the bank solely for the 
purpose of buying a plot requires a TO?

Don't forget to put Proglet back in the list. I'm not sure what time
should count as his last date of change of Status.

Proto:  Probate


Rename Rule 1755 ("No Non-Player Responsiblilities") to "No Non-Player
Responsibilities", and amend it by replacing "executor in probate" with
"trustee".


Amend Rule 1601 ("Probate") to read:

      A Monied Entity is an entity possessing Units of Currency, or named as
      the Payee or Payor of a Payment Order that has neither been satisfied
      nor vacated.

      The Notary shall place in Probate any Monied Entity that has no
Executor
      and is not already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made
aware
      of this condition.

      The Notary shall remove from Probate any registered player in Probate,
as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition, unless the
      Rules state otherwise.

      No Monied Entity may be destroyed.  Any attempt to destroy a Monied
      Entity is deferred until it is no longer Monied, any Rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      A Terminal Entity is a Monied deregistered player, or a Monied Entity
      that would be destroyed if it were not Monied.

[I was going to discard "terminal" but instead I'm fixing it.  I guess the
 idea is that a future Rule might force a player in debt through the Probate
 process while non-terminal.]


Rename Rule 1738 ("Executors in Probate") to "Trustees", and append this
text
to it:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      executes a Plan for the disposition of its Estate.

[Moved here from Rule 1757.]


Amend Rule 1739 ("The Probate Code") to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in Probate
shall
      specify a list of actions to be performed by the Trustee upon its
      execution.  This list shall be formulated according to the following
      steps, as applicable.

      1) Divide the assets of the estate amongst its creditors, assigning to
         each creditor assets equal to the amount due that creditor if
         possible, or a pro-rata portion if not; then vacate all debts.

      2) If the entity is terminal:
         Apply the Will of the entity in Probate, to the extent possible;
then
         divide the assets of the estate amongst its heirs, according to the
         Will, or in equal portions whenever the Will is silent or unclear.

      3) If the entity is terminal:
         Vacate all credits; then transfer all assets to the Bank.

      4) Announce that the entity is no longer in Probate.

      Upon execution of the Plan, the Trustee is authorized to perform all
      actions listed in it.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in Probate:

      * Estate:  the Assets and Debts of the entity in Probate.
      * Assets:  the Currency and Credits of the entity in Probate.
      * Credit:  a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payee.
      * Debt:  a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as payor.
      * Creditor:  the payee of a Debt.
      * Debtor:  the payor of a Credit.
      * Heir:  an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
Probate.

      When a credit is assigned to an entity, the Trustee shall execute a
      Payment Order from the payor of the credit to that entity for the
      same amount of Currency as the credit, unless the payor of the credit
      is the same as the entity to whom it is to be assigned.

[Instead of saying that the Plan does such-and-such, we say that the Trustee
 shall do such-and-such upon execution of the Plan.  Definitions moved here
 from Rule 1601.]


Repeal Rule 1757 ("Implementation of Probate Plans").

[Subsumed by the new Rules 1738 and 1739.]

Wouldn't is be possible to massively simplify the Probate process and
get rid of most of the incredibly arcane and almost completely useless
Probate code?

Protoproposal Chaos63 [rev. 2]

Proposal of the Week

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such by its
          creator.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is transmitted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Promotor with the clear indication that it is
          being transmitted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
