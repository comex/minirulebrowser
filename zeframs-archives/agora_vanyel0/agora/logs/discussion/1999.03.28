Protoproposal Chaos62 [rev. 8]

Executorship

Be it resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Vlad didn't say that his text was an example Proposal. Here's what he
actually said:

What Vlad is providing is an example of creative scoring of points, with
a real Proposal.

This is interesting, because it is in tension with the defence Scott is
giving of Summary Adoption, which is that it provides an interesting new
arrow for our economic quiver, in the form of agreements not to Object.
But if nobody cares enough to muster the political forces to get trivial
amendments proposed and adopted, why should we think they will care
enough to muster the energy to make the agreements necessary to prevent
people from Objecting? Either Blob or Scott or, both of them, must be
mistaken.

Personally, I think both of them are mistaken. Scott is mistaken because
Objecting is free. Let us say that Scott and I agree that in exchange
for not Objecting, he will pay me some fraction of the cost he would
have incurred in making a Proposal. As soon as news of this agreement
became public, every Player would be knocking on Scott's door demanding
their slice of the pie. The cost of securing agreements not to Object
would soon make Summary Adoption uneconomic.

And Blob is mistaken because he has chosen to forget that there is
already a perfectly good method of getting large numbers of trivial
amendments passed, in the style of Oerjan's 'Spring Cleaning' Proposal.

I disagree.  What he said was "Take the following proposal as an
example", which to me indicates that the text following is offered as
an exemplar, not intended for actual consideration.  Because a
credible contrary interpretation exists, this does not rise to the
level of a "clear indication that the question is intended to become a
Proposal" as required by Rule 1483.

No, it's not, as you yourself contended a few days ago.  Remember all
that terrible political pressure you whined about a few days ago?
That's the cost to objecting: that your peers will consider you an
obstinant jerk.  Costs do not need to be measured in VTs and P-Notes.

Protoproposal Chaos70 [rev. 5]

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

|     (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

Which was _how_many_ months in the making, exactly? Something like twelve,
wasn't it? That seems a bit excessive to me!

I'd rather not delay these little changes unnecessarily, just in the name
of politics. These are not things worth haggling over. Let's just fix 
them, and save the politicking for the real issues.
