In my opinion, Rule 1445 both grants a privilege and imposes an
obligation on the Speaker. Rule 1445 does not specify a time period
in which the tie-break decision should be taken We should therefore
assume that such a privilege is granted, and the obligation imposed,
at the instant the Voting Period of the relevant Referendum ends,
beause the Courts have held in the past that when the Rules impose an
obligation under certain conditions, and absent further detail as to
when the obligation starts, it is incurred at the earliest possible
moment. Lastly, no mechanism is provided for transferring that
obligation from the Player it initially applies to to another
Player.

I know that.  But the Taxation Rules imply that you can be hit by that
Blot _even if you pay all your debts before going On Hold._

RE: DIS: Hold that PO... 

If you pay all your debts, go on hold, get levyed with a tax just afterwards,
and then don't come back off hold until the tax levy becomes overdue, you will
get hit with a PI Blot for that tax levy.

Could you be more specific on what in the Rules leads you to infer that?

Well, you can drop out now and not play. Or, if you were really 
desperate to play, you could refuse to accept any changes to the 
Regs unless I postponed it to a time when you were available. It's

Various ideas that popped into my head this evening;

Proto: Vote Early, Vote Often

Create a rule, entitled "The Early Bird...", with text:

     At the end of the voting period of a Proposal, the Assesor
     shall pay out 1 VT to the first Player (other than the Assessor)
     to have voted on that Proposal, who did not subsequently change
     or retract eir vote.

[Comments: An incentive to vote - with a sting in the tail. As long
 as voting is secret, you can't be sure whether you really are 
 going to be the first one to vote.]

Proto: Skimming a bit off the top.

Amend rule 1449 ("The Assessor") to read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 0.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

      The Assessor shall also receive a Commission. At the end
      of the Voting Period for a Proposal, the Assessor shall
      pay out to emself an amount equal to 5% of the VTs spent
      on voting on that Proposal.

[Comment: Gives the Assessor good reason to encourage voting,
 although maybe it leaves em a bit too much at the mercy of the 
 Promotor, who controls the batch sizes. Things are better, if it
 is combined with the below.]

Proto: What does this lever do?

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. If tied to the Assessor's income, as proto'ed above, it
 gives the Assessor an interesting dilemma - does e raise prices to
 increase eir commission, or would e be better off lowering them
 and attracting more voters?]

Hmmm...  maybe we need a Rule that causes currencies held by Players on hold
to be treated as if they weren't in circulation.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have obligations apply to the Office not the
Player holding the Office?

The Speaker is not an Officer.

Interesting, but I don't think it's useful. Besides, with your next 
proposal, the Assessor could offer this as a reward for voting 
anyways :-)

I like this. It tries to reduce the VTs in circulation in good 
free-market style. One comment: I think a 10% skim might be better.

In that case, if the obligation/privilege was granted to Blob and has
not been transferred, why not think that it remains with Blob, despite
his no longer being Speaker? There is precedent for this: the Speaker
retains any Offices e was holding as Speaker, even if e ceases to be
Speaker.

I don't really see how that would help. It might delay a little the
necessity for levying a tax, bvut it certainly won't make it impossible
for a tax to be levied, and so won't solve the problem.

I think what we really need is a Rule which says that you have a week
after coming Off Hold to satisfy POs naming you as Payor which were
issued while you were On Hold. In fact, here's a first draft proto,
which basically just needs to be checked for precedence issues:

####
Proto-Proposal
Make Being On Hold Safe Again

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Payment Orders naming
Players On Hold", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, a Player has one
      week from the time e comes Off Hold to satisfy any Payment Orders
      naming em as Payor issued while e was On Hold, before e becomes
      liable to any penalties for failure to satisfy Payment Orders. If,
      after one week has passed from the time e came Off Hold, there
      remain unsatisfied and undisputed Payment Orders naming the Player
      as Payor, e is then liable to whatever penalties normally apply
      for failure to satisfy Payment Orders.

####

There, how does that look?

The Speaker is not Office, but a position, but I basically agree with you.

Zefram used to have a lot of ideas for making voting cheaper, and 
I didn't much like any of them. This is a little better because the
Voting Tariff is a lever. Still, the general objection remains: why
make VTs scarce if you're only going to react by making voting cheaper?
(Although I suppose I can anticipate your reply: VTs will remain both
scarce and valuable in this system because there's always the
possibility that costs will rise.)

Looks OK.  But it might be easier and cleaner just to amend the definition of
"Overdue".

Rule 1713/5 (Power=1)
Debt

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied, unless the payor of the Payment Order was
      On Hold at the time it was issued, in which case it becomes
      overdue if it remains effective and unsatisfied for more than
      seven days after the payor first comes Off Hold.

What do you think?

Offhand, I see no reason why we couldn't interpret 1445 that way.
The problem then becomes to determine whether Rule 402 negates
this privilege (assuming it does) permanently or temporarily; a case 
could be made that Blob may cast the deciding vote *after* the
Speaker Transition has ended, but not during it.

Even simpler:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently 
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days during 
      which the payor was not On Hold, and has not been satisfied.

This gives the player the benefit of a full seven days (which may or 
may not be a good thing).
