I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I think this is premature. The new Rule
states that the selection is to be performed as soon as possible after
the beginning of the Week; therefore I don't think the first selection
should be made until after the beginning of next Week. My understanding
of actions which are to be performed "as soon as possible after the
beginning of the Week" is that the requirement to perform them is
triggerred by the Week's beginning. Since "A Duty to Propose" was not in
effect at the beginning of this Week, there can have been no trigger
this Week for the requirement for you to perform the selection. In order
for there to be one, "A Duty to Propose" would have to act
retroactively, and this would violate R108.

The new Rule also states that the list of Public Service Statuses is to
appear in the Promotor's Report, of which Rule 1705 states:

      The Promotor's Report includes the number of P-Notes possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Promotor's Report.

I think that means that the PSS's should be published along with the
P-Note Report.

You are right _if_ the old officer is willing and able to pass eir

Although I wonder how much money you'll be able to earn - an officer
will certainly be reluctant to pay more than half eir salary for your

In addition, it will make the smooth flow of the recordkeeping that

weeks, due to RL issues, technical problems or whatever other reason

Proto: Simplify Currency Handling

Well, my Duty to Propose will be coming up quickly, so I thought I'd get a head
start with the proto.  Here is a less drastic solution to reducing Currency
Recordkeepor workload.  It leaves the Pragmatic Currency system in place but
streamlines the "pay out" mechanism by authorizing them to be made directly
with TOs, instead of requiring both POs and TOs.

================================================
Amend Rule 1661 by replacing the text "order the award of" with "pay out" and
by replacing all occurrences of "Payment Order" with "Transfer Order".

Amend Rule 1721/0 by appending the sentence "The Chancellor has Mint
Authority."

[I'm not sure this is really necessary, except that it may ensure the
continuity of Mint Authority for Currencies across Chancellor transitions and
avoid claims that all Currencies have been destroyed.  Better safe than sorry. 
Anybody think we need other changes to prevent Currency destruction when the
Chancellorship changes hands?]

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Bank" with
the text "The Mintor of P-Notes is the Chancellor".

Amend Rule 1696 by replacing the text "The Mintor of VTs is the Bank" with the
text "The Mintor of VTs is the Chancellor".

Amend Rule 1846 by replacing the text "Their Mintor is the Bank" with the text
"Their Mintor is the Chancellor".

Amend Rule 1435 by replacing the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank"
with the text "The Mintor of Indulgences is the Chancellor".

[Make the Chancellor the Mintor of all "official" Currencies.  This way we
don't need to have an Executor for the Bank, which will mean that only
Transfers authorized by the Rules can take money out of the Bank.]

Amend Rule 1470 by deleting the text "The Bank has Mint Authority".

[Mint Authority has been transferred to the Chancellor for the three "official"
Currencies, so the Bank no longer needs Mint Authority.]

Amend Rule 1735 by changing the Title to "The Chancellor's Banking Duties", by
deleting the text "The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.", by deleting
the text "(as the Bank's Executor)", and by deleting the entire last paragraph.

[The definition of "satisfy" for Payment Orders requires the Chancellor to
execute TOs for the Bank's POs.  Under this scheme, the Chancellor can no
longer commit Misappropriation because only TOs authorized by the Rules are
honored when the Bank is payor.]

Amend Rule 1817 as follows:

Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      Transfer Orders on the behalf of such entities), except for
      those transfers which would result in an entity possessing a
      negative quantity of Currency, which are considered invalid.  A 
      Recordkeepor must refrain from honoring invalid Transfer Orders.
      Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in the
      order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      Whenever a Transfer Order naming the Bank as payor would result in
      the Bank possessing a negative quantity of Currency, the
      Recordkeepor shall issue a Payment Order from the Bank for the
      same amount of Currency and to the same payee as specified in the
      Transfer Order.

[Clarifies the idea that TOs resulting in negative holdings are essentially
invalid and that a Recordkeepor is not allowed to honor invalid TOs.  Also
takes care of the problem caused by Bank pay-outs that are made when the Bank
has insufficient funds.]

Amend Rule 1479 by replacing the first occurrence of "Payment Order" with
"Transfer Order".

[Now anytime the Rules say "pay out", it means all the Player has to do is
issue a TO from the Bank to the payee.]

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the text "and issue a Payment Order from the Bank
to that Player for one Indulgence" with the text "and pay out one Indulgence to
that Player".

I agree but how is this different from the situation we have now?  These
difficulties are in fact the very ones that Lee is beset by _now_.  Do you
propose to allow this to continue?

My idea is simply to allow each Officer to handle these issues in the way
that is easiest for them and the other Players.  All that will be required
is that they produce an accurate Report.

I hope that my plan will allow Officers to simplify the bookkeeping job.  I
would like the mechanism of transactions to be as simple as possible as this
will ease programming the server.  However to be honest the method in use
now is not overly complicated.  The real problem is the sheer volume of the
transactions that must be recorded.  The automated server will reduce the
burden on Officers primarily by reducing the time it takes to handle each
transaction.

I am not insensitive to your point that it is dangerous to rely on
individuals too heavily, but what else can we do?  Done by hand or by a
computer program, there is always a person behind these mechanisms being
relied on to make sure the job is done.  I believe however that a strong
economy will ultimately require automation.  Even if the process is greatly
simplified (which I hope deregulation will allow) I think that the volume of
transactions will continue to be daunting.  In fact, I think any economy in
which this is not true will be too small to be of real interest.  Given the
difficulties we already see I believe automation to be the best choice.
