If I'm the distributor now, would it be a good idea to move the main lists
to win.tue.nl? If such is wanted, I will send a request to my majordomo-owner
to remove the agora-list, and add agora-discussion, agora-business and
agora-official lists. Or should we keep them at gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au, and
are you only changing the de-jure-distributorship?

Well, as Distributor, I guess it is your call, but personally I don't 
see the need to change anything.

I am amazed and deeply hurt that you (and Chuck and Scott and who knows
who else) think me capable of any these acts. What kind of a person do
you think I am?? I have given *six years of my life* to this game, and
yet for you that counts for absolutely nothing. 

Chuck's accusations against me in my role as CotC are especially unfair.
I have always performed my duties as CotC scrupulously, and I will
continue to do so as long as I hold the Office. If I were interested in
subverting the Judicial system, I could have taken control of it
completely. But, again, that means absolutely nothing to you.

The fact is that I have just defused potentially the most damaging
loophole that has ever been introduced into the Ruleset. I can
understand the reservations expressed by Morendil and others about the
means I used for doing so. But compared with the danger posed by Summary
Adoption, I believe that my use of such means was justifiable. If I were
truly the danger to the game you say I am, Agora would have been in
trouble a long, long time ago.

Orjan is correct. I had quite honestly not considered the R1497-related
ramifications.

I thought I knew, but then your actions proved my conception of you to

Since, I'm the only extant Legislator, I'd better start putting
out some legislation. And I think its obvious where I should start:

Vlad

The following is not a Proposal.

Proto Vlad WYSIWYG v. 1

----------
Let the following Rule be created: 

What You See Is What You Get

   A Public Communication is any collection of text which must be 
posted to the Public Forum to have effect or to fulfill a requirement.
To be valid, any message to the PF containing one or more Public
Communications must fulfill the following conditions in addition to
any other restrictions mandated by the Rules:

           a) The individual posting the message must be clearly and
              correctly identified.
           b) The Public Communication(s) contained in the message
              must be clearly identified at the beginning. 
           c) The message must not have excessive unrelated material
              that puts an unreasonable burden on a Player wishing to
              read the Public Communication(s). The standard of
              "excessive" shall be what a reasonable person would find
              to be excessive.

   If a document posted to the PF fails to meet any of the above
requirements, it shall be considered NOT to have been sent to the
Public Forum.

A good idea;  I would suggest giving the same protection to messages sent
privately to Officers, as well.

E.g., when you post the Full Logical Ruleset, it must be identified
as the Full Logical Ruleset, and not your favorite spaghetti
recipes or anything else. If I have a message with a Proposal and
two Transfers, I could give it the subject line "Proposal and two
Transfers", or say at the start "This message contains a Proposal and
two Transfers". That way I can't sneak in an Action Without Objection
at the end without mentioning it at the beginning. If you have a
better way of phrasing it, let me know.

Your proto just says "at the beginning" or somesuch, nothing about
the subject line.  How much of a message is its beginning?

etc.

I would tackle this a bit differently.  I would prefer not to tie it to
the Public Forum.  I'd prefer something like, "No message can
have any legal effect unless the author of the message is clearly
and accurately identified."  Short and sweet, applies to private
as well as public communications.

For the other fix, I'd define a Crime (Obfuscation?) along the lines
"If Player sends a message containing an inordinate amount of irrelevant or
repetitive information designed to deflect others from reading statements
within the message that have significant effects, e commits the Crime of
Obfuscation...".  Let the Courts decide what is "inordinate" and
what is "irrelevant".

I'm not that keen on forcing the subject or the beginning
of a message to contain blurbs about everything that will be done in it.
I think it's a good idea to allow Players to keep each other
on their toes with imbedded actions,  as long as there are legitimate
reasons for others to have to read each part of the message.

You could get into implementaion details and talk about "subject lines"
and "lines of text from the top" instead of subjectivitudes such
as "clearly" and "at the beginning"

Quantifiability.

No no no!  We (at least I) want a PBeM game I can largely
refocus with the filtering mechanism that comes with my MUA.

I would go as far as defining a language of TLAs to follow
the which-list TLA concerning topic, in the subject line.

My MUA's filters have a "begins" primitive, so if we mandated
that all new prooposals for instance had to be sent to the
business list with subject lines starting with Proposal:
for instance (which is
happening, is it already in the rules somewhere or was
Vlad being a visionary?) I could rig a filter line to
send anything with subject starting "BUS: Propo:" into
the new proposals bin.

Eeek! 

I just want to let the world know that I am strongly against all 
Beefurabi's "let's turn the game into a formal system" suggestions 
recently. I will resist any attempts to impose formal formatting
requirements on any communications. It stifles creativity, and damages
to relaxed attitude we have about such things.

Flexibility is more important. "Clearly" and "at the beginning" are
specific enough. Any finer points can be determined by the Judges, 
using common sense.

One thing I have learnt from Agora in the past few years (principly from
Gen Chaos), is that it is better to write law which is non-specific 
and open to common-sense interpretation, than to try to turn our
ruleset into a computer program which rigily defines valid and invalid
procedures.

Neither. We adopted it long ago as a courtesy to each other. 
One that I am loathe to turn into a requirement.

I like this idea but I agree with Crito that you should relax the 
requirements a bit. A message should make clear what its intended
effects are, and deliberate obfuscation should be a crime. But stronger
formatting requirements than that are just annoying.
