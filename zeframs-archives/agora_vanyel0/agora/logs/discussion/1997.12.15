BUS: Request of Currency Recordkeepors 

Murphy asks:

Unfortunately, it is not quite so simple, especially since the Indulgence
Distribution corrections.

debts and credits are listed below.

Very well, you two have convinced me.  However, I tend to think
that the number of A Public Voting Experiment should be 1749,
not 1754.  1349 is not clear on exactly what it is to assign
a number to a Rule, but I tend to think that my unofficial-and-to-a-d
reports are not assigning numbers to Rules, but rather announcing
the numbers which are expected to be assigned to Rules.

I will not argue that point.

A noble gesture.  However, it is my opinion that even with this
policy, the Frankenstein Mutator presents too much instability for its
continued function to be in the best interest of the Game. 

I might support a revised Mutator which spat out Proposals instead of
Rule Changes.

Proto Restore Indulgence Scarcity

It seems the recent crisis resolution has destroyed the one element of resource
scarcity that we had in the game.  I offer the following proto-proposal for
those who would like to see us return to the spirit (and letter) of the law as
Oerjan originally intended.  If there is sufficient support, I will go ahead
and propose this soon.  Of course, I welcome suggestions for improvement.

Create a Rule with the following text:

    One second after this Rule is enacted, all Indulgences, except for those
    owned by the Bank, are destroyed.  This Rule takes precedence over all
    Rules which would prevent the destruction of Indulgences.

    As soon as possible after the enactment of this Rule, the Herald shall
    issue a number of Payment Orders for Indulgences equal to the number of
    Blots outstanding at the time this Rule was enacted, minus one (if this
    number is less than one, then the Herald shall not be required to issue
    any Payment Orders) and then shall announce in the Public Forum that the
    conditions for the repeal of this Rule have been met.  The payor for each
    such Payment Order shall be the Bank and the payee shall be a Player
    randomly selected by the Herald from the list of all Players at the
    time of selection (a different random selection for each Payment Order).

    One second after the Herald legally announces that conditions for repeal
    have been met, this Rule is repealed.

Why was this protoed as a Power=1.5 self-repealing Rule and not an AI=1.5

I'm happy to go along with that. If you say 1749 is the least unused
Rule Number, then you should use that.

That's a little harsh, isn't it? It's true that there's been a fair
bit of backing-and-forthing over who's eligible to vote and whether
certain Proposals passed or not, but that's as much to do with the
discoveries about R1442 as with the Frankenstein Mutator.

Because a Proposal which conflicts with the Rules fails, and Rule
1672 states that a Rule Change which repeals the Frankenstein Rule is
illegal.  In order to be assured of overcoming this restriction, a
Rule with MI>1 (or which otherwise successfully takes precedence over
Rule 1672) is required.  I could have used MI=1+epsilon, but I felt
that was ugly.

Obviously, I agree. I note, however, that strictly speaking you needn't
have considered the issue of whether the votes were to be counted. The
Statement concerned only whether the votes were cast. The interpretation
of R955 is a separate matter.

Very interesting. How is this affected, if at all, by Chuck's
announcement that he has assigned (or intends to assign) 'A Public
Voting Experiment' the Number 1749? I note that 1749 was not selected
in the week of October 27-November 2. I await your response with
interest.

Not really.  1442 resulted in some votes being counted that apparently
were not, but didn't force me to do that much to handle that since I
already had all the necessary information.  The FM has twice
successfully made the legality of Voting contigent on conditions
related to things having to do with Frankenstein Monsters; such
conditions are poorly recorded, often unclear, and frequently subject
to debate.  The FM rule is often grossly ambiguous, internally or
externally contradictory, or otherwise problematic, and as long as it
is capable of intruding on the Voting process, it will continue to
plague Assessors.

I have never liked the FM much, but tolerated at first.  I am now
satisfied that it has had its day.

Well, there's some truth in what you say. But I don't think you should
tar the Virus with the same brush. Its effects have sometimes been
dramatic, but never grossly ambiguous, internally or externally
contradictory.

It's situations like this that justify granting the Speaker the power
to declare an Emergency.

Try as I might, I do not seem to be able to get that interpretation

Maybe, and maybe not. I'm not yet convinced that the situation is as
calamitous as you suggest. Nevertheless, I'd be interested to read any
proto you'd like to offer on the subject.

The FACT that 1753 was for a while believed to be the PROPER number for
the PVE Rule was MERELY a coincidence.  I incidentally considered USING 0
as the temporary number during my correction checks, but I found it
improper TO USE a number which I could instantly remember had NOT been
used.

I feel I MUST have a general policy that when I choose a RULE, its number
is merely a temporary PLACEHOLDER based on my best knowledge, and that as
long as all Rules are given their own number, whether this is the actual
one does not MATTER.  I believe this in general INCREASES certainty,
although the particular case here is an EXCEPTION.

LIVING BY THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE,
RJAN.

The Virus is much milder than the FM, but it is still presents a
substantial destabilizing influence, should it choose to infect a key
Rule.  I don't think we should have to mutate all of our "key" Rules
to MI=1.5 or MI=2, thereby making it more difficult to effect
intentional changes to key systems, merely just to protect them from
the damn Virus.

It's probably not, unless you happen to be the Assessor.  My point is
that by the time we get this particular problem cleaned up, there will
have been three, maybe four new infections and three more Frankenstein
Mutations.  It's hard to plot a course when the landscape changes
constantly.

Unless I'm mistaken, I paid the Proposal Fees for 3644 through 3646.
