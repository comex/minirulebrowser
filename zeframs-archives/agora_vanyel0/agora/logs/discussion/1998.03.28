I strongly disagree, in the case of Proposals.  The Players have a right
to know _exactly_ what they are Voting on.  That, in my view, is what Rule
107 tries to say.

You have admitted yourself to considering loopholes you could utilize when
voting FOR a Proposal.  Now if the only reason why you support a Proposal
is because of such a loophole, do you really want to discover that it was
just a typo?

Even worse, what if the typo "corrects" something that would have caused
you to vote AGAINST?


I might in a pitch admit that the Proposal should count as distributed.
But that means taking the error as significant.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

You misunderstand.  I believe that scrivener's error should not result
in the conclusion that the Proposal has not been distributed.  I agree
that the Players should know exactly what they are voting on; in this
case, it is the Proposal--typo and all--that was distributed.

I don't see how that follows.

If we didn't take it as having any significance at all, then we would
behave as if no error happened and the Proposal were distributed as
originally intended.
