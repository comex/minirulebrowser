You need to read past the first sentence of R106, all the way to the
second sentence:

      A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.

It might be possible to argue that the effect of Summary Adoption, even
at Power = 1, is to make the the "required number of votes" equal to zero,
but by no stretch of the imagination could you construe Summary Adoption
as making it the case the a Proposal Adopted Without Objection satisfies
Quorum. Hence Summary Adoption is in conflict with R106 - a conflict it
wins at Power = 3 due to its strong precedence clause, but which it
would lose at Power = 1 no matter what precedence clauses it contained.

To protect against the passage of an arbitrary Proposal?

It was Proposal 3500:

Proposal 3500 (Crito) (Disinterested)
More Spring Cleaning

Amend Rule 1681 by replacing all occurrences of
"Mutability Index" with "Power".

Amend Rule 1439 by replacing all occurrences of

The possibility is very much more remote using the normal Proposal
mechanism. Just for starters, it's more or less impossible to sneak
anything into a batch of Proposals. You might be able to sneak something
into the Queue, but how are you going to raise its Priority? But since
the example is one in which the scmaster is caught, let's say you eschew
secrecy and just brazenly go ahead and make the Proposal and raise its
Priority and get it distributed. That's still leaves you with a minimum
of three votes FOR and (currently) two declarations of Presence to find
to get your Proposal passed.

What I meant was not the possibility of "sneaking something through"
but of failing to vote against based on an erroneous understanding
of what votes have been cast so far.

Nah, that would just result in Steve calling all of us mean and
nasty, and an escalating insult war that won't end until either Steve
