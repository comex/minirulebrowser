Protoproposal Chaos105 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1645

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1645 be amended to read:

      (a) An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is
          permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
          that Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is
          called Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein
          referred to as the Delegating Player and the Player so
          appointed is herein referred to as the Delegated Player.

      (b) An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
          conditions are met:
        (1) the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;
        (2) the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
            Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;
        (3) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the posting
            of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public Forum, a
            Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;
        (4) the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the Office,
            and still holds the office at the commencement of the
            Period of Delegation; and
        (5) the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      (c) The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
          Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent
          to Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified
          by the Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of
          Delegation concludes two weeks after the Period of
          Delegation commences, or at the end of the Term of Service
          for the Delegated Office, or at the time (if any) specified
          by the Delegating Player, whichever is earliest.

      (d) During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player
          ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Delegated
          Player holds the Office temporarily and earns the Salary for
          that Office as described in other Rules.  At the end of the
          Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold
          the Delegated Office, and the Delegating Player resumes
          holding the Office, if e is permitted to do so.  If not, the
          Speaker holds the Office.

Protoproposal Chaos109 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1665

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1665 be amended to read:

      (a) The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
          decisions and determinations based upon their judgement. 
          When these decisions and determinations have effect on the
          Game State, Players shall always have the ability to make
          Claims of Error alleging that these decisions and
          determinations were made outside the authority given to the
          Officer.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which
          otherwise defines a final arbiter for such decisions and
          determinations.

      (b) If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making
          the Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement
          alleging that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of
          Responsibility, a Class C Crime.  This is the only time such
          a CFJ is permitted.

      (c) In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge
          must establish that the Officer:
        (1) went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules;
        (2) disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in regard
            to eir decisions and determinations; or
        (3) showed a pathological lack of judgement in such decisions
            and determinations.

      (d) The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain
          eir actions, and such Judgements shall be made in accord to
          the strictest possible standard of proof.

I agree that my proposed cost is too high.  I'm still not keen on the
idea of having to pay in P-Notes though.  With free Presence, I'm not
sure that the idea would be appealing enough for proposers.  They
don't actually need that many FOR votes to get something to pass.
What's more, why fund people who might vote AGAINST?  Better to make
sure of a small clique of supporters, and rest content in the
supposition that the bulk of the rest of the Players will just declare
Presence. 

To be honest, I'm going off Presence in a big way.  Perhaps I'm just
turning into a reactionary old fogey (hush the cries of "You mean
you're not one already?"), but I think the situation we had just before
December, when people were required to propose, and where we had free
voting, was actually a good one for the game. 

Michael.

You made the assumption that 3833 was the same as "3830", no?
Otherwise "3830" still needs a number.

The batch size was three. Three Proposals had already been

So intent does matter!

But that small clique better have VTs. If your proposal is intended
to benefit the masses, and not the wealthy, those with many VTs are
going to vote Against, no matter what.

Our supposed economy is certainly a centralized planner's dream. 
Everyone is either a government employee or unemployed. The result
is the best strategy for a Player is to find some work to do, then
convince the other Players to pay em for it, whether it needs to
be done or not. With 2-3 Proposals/week, do we really need seperate
offices for Proposing ond vote counting? As Oerjan has pointed out,
the Speaker did both in October of 1993, and that month we had
130 Proposals, with everyone allowed to vote.
   We have artificial mechanisms to control inflation, but inflation
is really only a problem when it makes credit hard to obtain,
and we have no credit in Agora. We have no free enterprise, no
means of generating wealth (and anyway, that would be considered
bad since that would lead to inflation). Our taxes are automatic,
and unrelated to government expenses. Frankly, Monopoly looks like
a better economic simulation than what we have right now.

It's not only generally accepted, it's a source of a lot of the fun, too.  8)

I don't find being unreasonable fun. It's difficult to explore
unintended secondary effects when unintended primary effects keep
getting in the way.

I didn't say it was fun to be unreasonable.  But much of my enjoyment
(and that of most other Players, I suspect) has come from exploring
the ramifications of actions and wordings that had *reasonable* unintended
consequences.

BTW, how is it possible to have any unintended secondary effects to explore if you
don't have any unintended primary effects?  8)  <-- Vlad, please note the smiley, and
do try to have some fun, in spite of the occasional "unreasonableness" that occurs.

We just have different definitions of reasonable. I always play games
with the attitude that when the spirit or intent of a rule is clear,
but the wording conflicts, then the wording needs to be reinterpreted
to fit. Same goes with the actions of the players. After all, this is
a "friendly game", no?

I illustrate with an example. When I move my queen in chess, I do
so with the knowledge that I might suffer the unintended effect of
opening my position up to attack. That is fun. If I find, however,
that my opponent has instead swabbed my queen with the Ebola virus
while I was out of the room, that, while also unintended, is not fun.
Messing with the game's components is a primary effect. Of course,
that's part of Agora, but that shouldn't mean anything goes, nor
even anything not directly prohibited by the Rules goes.

Such is emphatically not the tradition in Agora.

Disregarding intent does not mean being unreasonable.  It merely means
that we don't try to dig into each other's minds.  This is not a
radical concept; the law of contract in the United States works the
same way.

Protoproposal Chaos108 [rev. 3]

Reformat Rule 1644

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1644 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player who:
        (1) is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official
            Report; and
        (2) fails in three consecutive weeks to produce the weekly
            Report for that Office
          commits the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty. The penalty
          for the commission of this Infraction is the same as that
          for a Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is
          removed from the Office in the performance of whose duties e
          has been Derelict.

      (b) The Registrar is authorized to detect and report the
          commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
          other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts is
          authorized to detect and report the commission of the
          Infraction of Dereliction of Duty by the Registrar.

We don't need to "dig". Asking someone is usually enough. We're
all reasonable people here. In RL, one sometimes has to deal with
unreasonable people.

Some basic requirements for a working economy, based on Monopoly
(one needs to aim low to begin with):

1. A single freely convertible currency. 
We don't have this, for unclear reasons. Is there any real
reason to have VTs, P-notes, Indulgences separate? Other than
making things complex?

2. Regular income 
We have this, sort of.

3. Regular, but sometimes unpredictable, expenses
We don't really have this.

4. Forms of investment
In Monopoly, this is property. By gaining a monopoly, one's
investment increases in value.

5. Means of credit
Mortgages.



I'll try and work up a proto.

Protoproposal Chaos112 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1664

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1664 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is
          always Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player can switch
          from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by
          sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does change
          so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
          are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is
          part of the Registrar's Report.

      (b) A Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending to
          the Public Forum saying e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
          effective if:
        (1) the player posting the Call is Rebellious;
        (2) no other effective Call for Revolt has been made that
            week; and
        (3) a successful Revolt has not occured for a month or more.

      (c) As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has
          been posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
          succeeds, as outlined below, and post the result to the
          Public Forum.

      (d) The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The
          Registrar selects a random integer from 1 to the number of
          Players at the time of the Call for Revolt. If this number
          is less than or equal to the number of Rebellious Players at
          the time of the Call for Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds,
          otherwise it fails.

      (e) If a Revolt succeeds, then:
        (1) A Speaker Transition occurs;
        (2) All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
            fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold
            them temporarily instead;
        (3) The Registrar becomes required to:
          (A) vacate all Blots of, and pay out 2 VTs to, each Player
              who was Rebellious at the time of the Rebellion; and
          (B) levy a tax of 75% on Indulgences.
        (4) All Rebellious Players become Abiding again.

      (f) If a Revolt does not succeed, then:
        (1) All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots.
        (2) The Player who Called for Revolt gains 2 (additional)
            Blots

      (g) The Registrar is empowered to levy the tax mandated by
          subdivision (e)(3)(B) of this Rule, when it is required.

      (h) The holder of the Patent Title "Robespierre" is exempt from
          the tax mandated by subdivision (e)(3)(B) of this Rule, even
          if other rules do not allow tax exemptions.

      (i) The Registrar shall execute all Payment Orders required by
          this rule.

      (j) The Registrar is authorised to vacate any payment orders
          this rule requires em to vacate.

We may not really be that far apart here.  It seems to me that in Agora,
we have interpreted R101 to mean that the letter of the law (and actions)
is given precedence over the spirit and intent.  That is not to say that spirit
and intent are ignored.  They play a major role in resolving ambiguities.
However, I will admit that I don't find it reasonable to purposefully *misinterpret*
a rule or action, even when it's clear what the real intention was.  If you
include that in your definition of "reasonable" then, indeed, we will continue
to disagree.  This strikes me as a kind of cheating, because then we never
have to live with the consequences of our mistakes, as long as the "unmistaken"
intention was clear - you just reinterpret the action or rule to pretend it was
the way everyone wanted it.

In spite of the tendency for this kind of literalism to descend into extra nit-pickyness,
I have found Agora to be, for the most part, a "friendly" game.  And I hope
you and I will continue to do so, even if we sometimes disagree.  8)

Indeed, you have come up with an example of an unreasonable (and decidedly
un-fun) example of unintended effects.  But your example is one of an effect
that is outside the rules and scope of the game of chess.  IMO, the interpretation
of Rules, actions, and their interactions lie at the heart of games of Nomic.  Of
course I agree this doesn't mean anything goes, R101 says you have to follow
the Rules.  As to whether anything not directly prohibited by the Rules goes,
this leads us directly to the old discussion about the meaning of "possible"
and "impossible" wrt Agora.  But I think that is a digression from the current
topic.  I suspect you and I may be in agreement over that one.

Protoproposal Chaos120 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1723

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1723 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is Sane if:
        (1) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
            states that it is a Sane Proposal;
        (2) the Proposal is Interested; and
        (3) the Proposer has paid, prior to the distribution of the
            Proposal, 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly for this
            purpose (and not for any other).

      (b) Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
          Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
          non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or
          which would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a
          Sane Proposal.

It depends. A classic example comes from the game "Third Reich". In
that game there are airbase counters, which need to be placed in
supply. There are also 'units' such as infantry corps, which also
need supply. Now, some wag once pointed out that the rules only
describe supply sources for "units" not for "counters', so that if
one followed the rule literally, one could never place an airbase
counter anywhere. I would never play with anyone who wanted to
read that rule literally, period. It's clear that the same supply
rules were meant to apply to both kinds of pieces. It's common sense.
I have always found it odd that in games with unchangeable rules,
(and I am personally a stickler for the rules), such problems are
easily fixed, while in Agora, where changing the rules is routine,
fixing such a problem can take weeks or months.
   Now, one can of course go too far. Often you get people playing
by 'house rules', perhaps unaware that they are misinterpreting a
rule, then they go play in a tournament and get into an argument with
their opponent, who sees things differently. That's when you need
someone to lay down the law -- an impartial judge. A good judge should
have sufficient professionalism to know when the letter of the rules
should be followed literally (and this is usually the case), or
when it should not.
  That's why I like G. Chaos' summary adoption rule. If it's clear
a rule is fine except that 'Proposal' is used in one place instead
of "rule change', we should be able to fix that quickly. I think
that would fix the main difficulty I have with the game. The
utility of summary adoption would be immense. In fact, now that I
consider it, I think I will vote for it even though I can't afford it.

Conection?

Vlad seems to have a deep confusion about Proposals versus distributions of
Proposals.  His CFJ tried to distinguish between the Proposal which the
Promotor tried to distribute in the first message, and the one he tried to
distribute in the second message.  As I noted, they are the same Proposal.

The same confusion, again.  The Rule says that only three proposals may be
distributed.  It does not say that only three distributions of proposals
may be made.

You forgot to quote the line that began "Let's say that Vlad is correct
(I'm not saying one way or the other)".  So yes: if you're correct, then
intent does matter.

How about a middle case? Say I move my queen, intending to get it to a safe
square, but I accidentally move it one square too far. (This happens more
times than I can count.) If we weren't really concerned about playing by
the Rules, you might let me take it back.  In stricter situations, I'd be
stuck with it.  And if it turned out to be an unexpectedly good move (a
daring attack, say), that would be fun, and effective regardless of my intent.

Then is the world economy not a working economy, because it has
more than one currency?  If you're aiming to list the *requirements*
of an economy, as you state, it seems to me you should instead say,
"At least one freely convertible currency."

An economy needs at least two different types of items of value,
in order for trading to occur.  If the only thing of value is
a single, fungible currency, there is no incentive to trade.

Now, those two things of value can be two different currencies,
or one currency and one other sort of thing.  In times past, VTs,
P-Notes, and Indulgences were so closely tied to what was done with
them, that there *did* need to be different currencies in order
for trading to occur.  With mechanisms like the Voting Tariff in
place, this may no longer be the case.

Not as much as we should, perhaps, but we have it to some extent--perhaps
the three Proposals distributed next week will all be Proposals you care
deeply about, and you want to cast two votes each on all three of them?

I would argue that in Agora, changing the Rules themselves is that
investment--you can improve your own position by altering the
Rules.

I'm not sure I follow.  Could you elaborate on why this is necessary
for an economy?

Protoproposal Chaos131 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1726

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1726 be amended to read:

      (a) There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
          Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting
          it to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify
          when it is to take effect; if it does not do so, or
          specifies a time prior to its Execution, it takes effect
          when Executed.  For a Guillotine Application to take effect,
          it must:
        (1) state that it is a Guillotine Application;
        (2) clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it applies,
            the Voting Period of which must be in progress;
        (3) bear the signatures of a sufficient number of Active
            Senators such that the ratio of the number of Active
            Senators whose signatures it bears to the number of Active
            Senators whose signatures it does not bear exceeds the
            Adoption Index of the Proposal; and
        (4) bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      (b) When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting
          Period of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.
          This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules governing
          the Voting Period of Proposals.

Protoproposal Chaos121 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1724

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1724 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is Urgent if:
        (1) the text of the message wherein it is submitted explicitly
            states that it is an Urgent Proposal;
        (2) the Proposal is Interested; and
        (3) the Proposer has paid, prior to the distribution of the
            Proposal, 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly for this purpose
            (and not for any other).

      (b) The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      (c) This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify
          the Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

But in such games, the rules have been designed by a small group
of people, in consultation with each other, with a common purpose.
In Third Reich, it is safe to assume that the game designers would
not have intentionally made rules about airbase counters which could
never come into play.  A more reasonable assumption is that they
meant "counters" in some of the places where they said "units."

The Rules in Agora are made by a larger group of people, often
working at cross-purposes.  The question then becomes, whose
intent do you follow?  An example from Agoran history is
particularly good here.  (Unfortunately, my memory is rather
fuzzy on the incident--perhaps someone else can fill in
the details.)  Someone wanted to propose to change a time limit
in some rule to two weeks.  (It was probably something like one
week before).  From the pre-proposal discussion, it was fairly
clear the eir intention was to change the limit to two weeks.
However, e wrote "two days" in the Proposal.

The error was immediately noticed when the Proposal was distributed.
However, a group of Players realized it would be to their advantage
to actually change the period in question to two days.  They banded
together and managed to get the Proposal adopted.  This was not
done secretly--it was publicly discussed.

If one is to follow the spirit of the rules when it conflicts with the
letter of the rules, whose intent does one follow?  The proposer, who
clearly intended for the period to be two weeks, or the people who
voted for it, who clearly intended the period to be two days?  This
problem does not arise in Third Reich, where the game designers may
be considered to have a single intent among them, but it does
arise in Agora.

Probably because if there is no in-game method for changing the Rules,
players do not hesitate to change them (or interpret them a certain way)
via an out-of-game consensus, if that is necessary for better game
play.  My gaming group does this from time to time, and it is
instructive to note that this is done not just to make common-sense
interpretations of the Rules, but also to make house rules that
are entirely contrary to the written rules.  In nomic, conversely, part
of the fun, IMO, is fixing such problems from within the system.
Because we have a in-game method for fixing problems, we try to
use it rather than resorting to an out-of-game agreement.

Yes. In fact this was a mahjor design decision. Each of the commodities
represents a different commodity - the ability to vote, the ability to
propose, the ability to survive debt, infractions, and continue playing
the game. The relative value of these commodities is not fixed in the 
rules, but varies according to circumstances. I will strongly resist 
the creation of any single currency with fixed conversion rates between
these commodities.

You are making the mistake of thinking that money is the fundamental 
part of an economy - it isn't. Commodities - objects of intrinsic value -
are, and by nature they only have value in a certain context. Money is
only a medium of exchange, necessary when you have too many commodities
to make barter feasible.
