As far as I know there hasn't been a resolution. Swann claims
that Macross never forbade from him making the amendments, while
Macross disagrees. But the matter has not been sent to the Courts
for deliberation.

You have misstated my position.  I did not forbid him to make the
amendments (an oversight on my part), however, I believe that
the nature of the amended Orders directed at me is such that they
are invalid.  Thus, I ignored it and issued my Palindrome Order
under the condition that it was legal to do so.  The Palindrome
Order should effectively prevent him from using the Order loophole.
Currently, there is a CFJ pending on whether or not that Order has
actually been issued.  If it has, then I will not feel the need to
contest the validity of Swann's amendments unless I am accused of
Contempt by Action with regard to them.  If it hasn't been issued,
then Swann's Coup would seem to have succeeded, although I still
have one or two tricks up my sleeve that might prove useful.

I suspect I'm one of the 'certain other Players' to whom Ørjan refers,
but he has misstated my position slightly. I do not find it illogical
that Rules should be followed for their own sakes. But it does seem
to me that games in general can be divided usefully (for our purposes
here) into those games in which the rules are followed for their own
sakes, and those games whose rules take the further step of specifying
penalties for breaches of the rules, thus inviting players to consider
breaking the rules as a strategy. My first point is that Agora has
clearly become a game of the second type. My second point follows from
the first: if you want to discourage some particular action very
strongly in a game of the second type, then your best recourse is to
some appropriately strong penalty, not to appeals to respect the rules
for their own sakes. So it follows, for example, that if we are really
worried about a person registering as two Players simultaneously, in
breach of R1432, then we ought to penalize this action much more strongly
than we actually do. As things stand, I cannot see what argument would
be available to us in answer to someone who had registered 2 or more
times simultaneously, and who claimed that the absence of some appropriate
penalty is simply a loophole in the Rules, and that this was merely a
perfectly legitimate scam like other scams.

For one-time awards, I think it's sufficient to get a Proposal adopted whose
text is "Upon the adoption of this Proposal, Swann is granted the Patent
Title
of Puppet Dictator".

I intended the Plot-creating text to be a one-time effect, not part of a
Rule's text.  Apparently I screwed up the formatting, and I suspect that
formatting will take precedence over explicitly stated intent in determining
the effect of adopting it.

Left over from an earlier version, when Adjacent Plots were going to affect
each other's Production.
