It's a board game, German in origin, which explores ideas about trade in
a number of interesting ways. It's played on a large island continent
made of 21 hexagons (1 + 7 + 13), surrounded by sea (perhaps an
abstracted Australia?). 20 of the 21 hexagons produce 5 different kinds
of commodities (wood, clay, wheat, sheep and stone; there is also a
desert hex which produces nothing), and are arranged differently in each
game, which produces different playing conditions and different
opportunities. For example, in some games all the commodities are more
or less equally available, in others, one may be abundant while another
is extremely scarce.

The commodities are needed to do everything of importance in the game,
in particular to build roads (wood and clay) and settlements (wood,
wheat and bricks for a village, from memory, and something else for a
city). Settlements are placed on the vertices where the hexagons meet,
and give a player access to the production of that sector. With the
exception of the starting two villages, settlements can only be built at
the ends of roads, which run along the edges of the hexagons. Players
use roads to reach the most attractive vertices and build settlements
there, and to try to fence off areas of the board to prevent other
players building into them.

Production is determined by a 2D6 roll. Each of the 20 producing hexes
has one of the numbers 2-6, 8-12 assigned to it, with each of the 10
numbers appearing on 2 sectors; 7 is a special case, when no production
occurs and other effects happen, which we needn't go into here. The
assignments each game vary, with different kinds of sector getting the
common numbers (5 and 9, and especially 6 and 8).

On each players turn he can try to trade commodities e has for
commodities e needs. Eir ability to do this depends on many factors: the
general availability of different kinds of resources and whether any
player has a monopoly or near monopoly on that resource; on what the
other players need; on how inventive the player is in proposing trades.

It's an unusual game in concept and game play - and *vastly* superior to
the loathsome Monopoly.

You should probably also have noted the self-repeal of R1863 (A Duty to
Vote), on Jan. 6.

The archives I have readily available only go back to March 2 of

I assume so.  ford@bayside.net has 2-3 weeks worth of mail sitting on it
that I probably won't be able to retrieve any time soon.

1982 ruleset, doesn't *encourage* player's to make proposals at all.
Rather, it *requires* them to do so, as a part of their turn. The first
internet game of nomic, Nomic World (1992-93), abandoned the turn-based
idea as impractical (because of the large numbers of players, among
other reasons), and ways have had to be sought to encourage players to
make proposals ever since. It has taken Agora five years to come full
circle (in a sense), and reinstitute a requirement on players to make
proposals, which we have recently done, although of course we haven't
re-introduced the concept of turns. In the interim, Agora has encouraged
players to make proposals, in different ways at different times, but
always basically by rewarding them in ways other then giving them
points. Usually this has meant giving them what were called Extra Votes
(which have since evolved into the Voting Token), or, more recently,
Proposal Notes, which are needed to make Proposals and get them
distributed.

In my opinion, the current state of affairs is that Agora DIScourages, not
ENcourages the making of proposals, by forcing people to pay to make them,
or at least to put them up to vote.

I'd like to add an unofficial annotation to R693 based on the
Judgements of CFJs 1110 and 1111 (regarding the end of the VP for
P3810-3812); however, since this had so many varied opinions in
discussion, I wanted to solicit comments on a draft before doing so:

[CFJ 1110 (Judged Dec. 11 1998; Appeal completed Dec. 22 1998) &
 CFJ 1111 (Judged Dec. 22 1998): When the voting period of a proposal
 whose voting period is in progress is changed via amendment of this
 Rule, a vote is valid if it was cast after the start of the voting
 period and prior to its end, those times being determined by the
 text of this Rule at the time the vote is cast.]

Comments?

I've seen Settlers of Catan but unfortunately have yet to play it.

As for Monopoly, I wouldn't be so hard on it--it's the sort
of game my gaming group plays when none of us wants to think very hard
and we just want something to do while we sit around the table and chat. :)
(Actually, we haven't played Monopoly in quite some time.  _Talisman_,
2nd ed., seems to be our currently preferred low-thought, high-luck
game.  The 1st edition of Talisman--now *there* was a loathsome game. :)

Of course, the latter isn't really an encouragment--if you're not
interested in making Proposals in the first place, you have no need
for P-Notes.

Wouldn't you know it.  Up until they upgraded my e-mail system, I had all
reports from the beginning of my tenure as Herald (year and a half?).  But
at that point I lost all but those going back to October of '98. 8(

For a low-thought, high luck game, I prefer Yahtzee. The problem with
Monopoly is that it consists basically of positive feedback loops. Any
slight advantage tends simply to magnify until one player dominates, and
the others are bored.

Risk has this problem, too.

Even when Agora had a winning system based on points, I never tried
particularly hard to win, at least not by straightforward means (scams
are a different question). What I find most attractive about Nomic in
general, and Agora Nomic in particular, is the open-endedness of its
goals. It's an extremely creative game because there are few limits on
what you can decide to set your mind to. Usually, I've set myself to
getting certain kinds of Proposals passed with the idea of exploring
certain kinds of conceptual terrain. For example, over the last two
years, I've proposed and lobbied for several different kinds of changes
to the voting system (compulsory secret voting, compulsory public
voting, compulsory voting, laissez-faire voting, voting that costs,
voting that doesn't cost, and so on), with the idea of exploring what
effects these different kinds of regimes have on the political process.
Lobbying for a Proposal by explaining it to the other Players, trying to
convince them that it is a good idea, perhaps bribing them if they are
still not convinced, (in other words, the political process) is itself a
very interesting process, and simultaneously observing it and
participating in it provides a great deal of the interest of the game.

I've been playing in Agora for four and a half years, and in that time I
think I've only gotten bored about twice. And in each case, events
occurred or new ideas arose which reinvigorated my interest in the game.

At least in Risk, the disadvantaged players can try to gang up on the
leader and take him down a peg or three, which acts as some kind of
check on the positive feedback loops. In Monopoly, there's simply
nothing you can do at all. There's almost no strategy to the game, and
what little there is is all in the first few turns around the board,
when players have to make decisions about what properties to buy (do I
buy everything I land on, or try and save my money for the prime real
estate?) Once most of the property is bought, you're totally at the
mercy of the dice.

But making P-Notes is easy. There is only rarely any competition for the
Proposal Queue, if you are willing to be patient, you should only have to 
pay 1 P-Note to get your proposal distributed. And you get 2 P-Notes back
if it passes! That means you can risk a 50% failure rate, and still break
even. And with a bit of creativity, and a bit of politicking, it's not 
too hard to achieve that.

I tell you what: I will back any Proposal that I think is a fair risk.
If asked, I will pay 1 P-Note to raise the Priority of any proposal I
think has a fair chance of passing, on the grounds that the author 
promises to give me the 2 P-Notes reward when the proposal passes. If
the proposal fails, I will expect no payment.

You can accomplish some of this through strategic trading.

The Voting Period is up, will the Registrar please announce the results,
so the Treasuror can implement eir Budget and we can get our economy
running again?

Also, the Chancellor should reset the Basic Officer Salary soon, before 
the 25th of the month, or else we shall have to wait another month
before salaries are paid.

As Assessor, I am reluctant to turn up the cost of voting until such
time as these two changes are made.

True, but only if you have something to trade. If you're already in a
weak position, then your negotiating position will be inferior.

An excellent choice, I agree.  My brother and I started playing
Yahtzee one night when we were both in rather silly moods, and before
long it evolved into full-contact Yahtzee. :)
