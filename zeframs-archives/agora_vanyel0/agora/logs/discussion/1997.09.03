Hmm.  This might need a little clarification.  I would assume that a Player
"makes a Proposal" when e sends it to the Promotor.  This will require a bit of
coordination between Cartographor and Promotor that may cause a little extra
work for both, chasing down time stamps.

Hey, Agora is the most picky Nomic on the net, and proud of it. ;-)
(Except Scott, I think.)

1) "blown to smithereens" and "blown up" are close enough to be considered
synonyms.
2) "he" should be "e"(*), we are trying to be gender neutral here,
although I haven't seen a female-sounding Player for ages, except Kelly
who wasn't.
3) "player" and "public forum" should probably be capitalized.
4) "considered" is best left out, though we've become more lenient towards
it recently.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

(*) The Spivak pronouns (from Spivak's "The joy of TeX"):

e/em/eir/eirs/emself, all forms except "e" made by chopping "th" off
"they" etc.
