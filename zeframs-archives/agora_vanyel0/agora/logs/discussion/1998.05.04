I like the idea of having levers to play with, but I think it might be
more interesting if there were also some constraints on the way the
powers were applied.  In the Chancellor's case for example, it might
generate a nice dynamic if there was some sort of connection between
minting new currencies and the power to set the Officer Salary.

Michael.

Fix the Proposal Queue

Amend Rule 106 ("Adopting Proposals") to read:

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if
      it receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is 
      achieved.

[Comment: Allows undistributed proposals to never be voted upon.]

There are constraints: the Chancellor can only set the BOS between
0 and 2 VTs for example; and if the setting is too high, the Accountor
will have to act to levy taxes to respect the Voting Token Circulation
Level. In early drafts of the proto, all the powers were vested in the
Chancellor, but then it occurred to me that splitting them between
different Players would make for a more interesting dynamic. Will the
Chancellor and Accountor co-operate on monetary policy, or pursue
different policies? And what differing political situations will develop
as they co-operate or don't?

I'm not sure I follow your suggestion concerning minting new currencies.
What do you have in mind?
