That may be your custom, but I don't think you can say it is general. 
I for example will generally use a left margin of only one or two 
spaces.

Protoproposal Chaos62 [rev. 7]

Executorship

Be it resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.
