Well, an extension might not have helped Swann, since his Judgement
being late seems to have been caused by a misunderstanding about
time zones.

In other words, Keep It Simple, Stupid. I agree. These are all good
suggestions. One further question: what if the CotC emself applies
for an extension? Do we allow em to automatically grant emself an
extension, as another privilege of Office? Or do we make the CotC
apply to, say, the Speaker?

I do wish you hadn't brought that up. It would have been a lovely 
loophole to discover and exploit at a later date.

Proto-Proposal
Judicial Extensions

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Extension of time for
Judging" be created with the following text:

      A Judge or Justice other than the Clerk of the Courts who has
      been selected to Judge a CFJ or an Appeal may seek an extension
      of the one week normally provided for the delivery of a
      Judgement by submitting an Application for an Extension to the
      Clerk of the Courts. The Clerk of the Courts may seek an
      extension by submitting an Application for an Extension to the
      Speaker. An Application for an Extension cannot legally be
      executed unless it clearly indicates for which CFJ or Appeal
      an extension is being sought.

      The Clerk of the Courts (or the Speaker, if the Sponsor of the
      Application is the Clerk of the Courts) is authorized to grant
      the extension provided that the Sponsor of the Application is
      still required to deliver Judgement on the CFJ or Appeal named
      in the Application, and that such an extension has not already
      been granted to its Sponsor. The Clerk of the Courts (or the
      Speaker, as above) grants the extension by indicating in the
      Public Forum that e is doing so.

      If an extension is granted, its effect is to extend by one
      week the time provided to the Sponsor of the Application for
      the delivery of Judgement on the CFJ or Appeal named in the
      Application. That is, the Judge or Justice has 14 days from
      the time of eir original selection in which to deliver
      Judgement, and provided that e does so within that period, e
      shall not be made ineligible to Judge, nor suffer any
      penalties, for failure to deliver Judgement, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

####

Notes:

1. This should work whether or not we adopt Scott's 'Persistent Judges'
proto. The CotC is authorized to grant extensions only if the Sponsor
of the Application is still required to deliver a Judgement. If we do
adopt Scott's proto, we'll end up with a nice system in which the CotC
can grant you an extension even after the 7 day deadline for judging
is passed, provided that you haven't yet been named a delinquent Judge.
I would, however, especially appreciate any input from Scott over
whether this might run into trouble with 'Persistent Judges' in ways
I haven't anticipated.

2. As usual, I found the precedence clause tricky to write. This Rule
needs to take precedence over Rules 408 and 1447, at least. Any others?

The characters appearing as + and ; were originally opening and closing
double-quote characters, looking like << and >> respectively.  I assume they
have ASCII values above 127 and got mangled in transit.

Perhaps "riglais" translates as "regular"?

...any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Otherwise, the Rule loses a precedence conflict with R1556.

In another message you say that you didn't think you'd seen this

If there is a willing successor, the Speaker can ascertain this and
subsequently pass the Office on to them.  No problem.  What's more I
really don't think that asking an Officer who wants to resign to get a
successor lined up first is such a trial.

Sure.  My description of your proposal as "flawed" is too strong; I
admit.  I think I must have been in a particularly combative mood when
I wrote before. 

I believe that simplicity is worth more than a feature of such minor
importance and usefulness.

Let the voters decide!  (Speaking of which, I really should vote on
some of the current proposals :-)

Is the above provision effective?  I tend to think it is:
although usually only comments with no effect are placed
in brackets, there is no Rule to the effect that text in
brackets is without effect.
<<

I would also like to add that titles are not strictly part of the
rules, anyway, and they can be changed by the rulekeepor without
objection. Really, my comment was half meant as a reminder to Chuck to
fix the typo, and as long as noone objects, e could do that even if
the poposal as a whole had failed.

This essentially makes the possibility to abstain redundant -
declaring presence does the same at lower cost. So why not make this
official, by replacing "FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN" with "FOR or
AGAINST" in 683? 

If that is added to the proto, I'll support it.

I am thinking about setting up a new email nomic, and I was going
through the initial rules of Agora for that purpose. One thing is not
quite clear to me: Why is there a separation of being speaker and
being voter?

If the Speaker was really and honestly determined not to abuse this,
would it be possible to omit his regulation and make the Speaker a
voter, too? And how could the Speaker abuse eir voting rights?

Thanks for any hints,

I am working on a Judicial Reform, making use of an extended form of

whole process. I'll post that in a few days...

Ooops. Let me note that I just confirmed that proto-decision as my 
actual decision to the CotC, for fear of failing to Judge in a timely 
fashion. Nevertheless I'll respond to your comments...

Definitely - I think this is what Scott had in mind when referring a 
few messages ago to "probative usefulness" or some such phrase.

On the other hand, I still don't feel at all confident that this
principle should suffice to overturn Crito's Judgement.

Well - I have taken the remarks from a while ago as to the necessity
of never unnecessarily overturning a Judgement to heart, and it
seems to me that whenever the Rules are silent, rather than merely
unclear or contradictory, on a particular matter, a Justice should
abstain from striking down a Judge's decision unless a flaw in their
construction of the Rules involved can be discerned.

I agree, though, that the argument that "all entities are equal in
the eyes of the Rules" should be taken with a grain - nay, a heap -
of salt. ;)

Had it been submitted as an original Judgement, I would have found 
the statement FALSE for the reasons that you invoke, I suppose.

Sorry for the delay, but my office computer shut down on me Friday afternoon,
so I couldn't get to it until this Monday morning.

I am assuming that Steve's attempt at EiP business for Swann failed completely.
Specifically, that all attempts to vacate POs for Swann were done before the
Rules authorized them and so were unsuccessful.

At this point you ended up with 5 Fugitive Blots, as well as retaining POs in

At this point, the Rules required me to issue a new PO for 5 Blots and destroy

probate, you now end up with 10 Blots (the original POs for 5 Blots that were
not vacated, plus the new PO for 5 Blots from the Fugitive Blot conversion).
****

Date: Thu, 2 Oct 1997 15:53:57 +0200 (MET DST)

    The CotC reports the following Infractions and issues the appropriate POs:

    Blob committed the Infraction of Failing to Judge with respect to CFJ 948
    Blob committed the Infraction of Failing to Judge with respect to CFJ 966
    Blob committed the Infraction of Failing to Judge with respect to CFJ 977

****
Here your zombie got caught up in a CFJ spam and ended up inadvertently
committing the above mentioned infractions.  At this point you had a total of
28 Blots.
****

This was the status before your excorsism.  So you ended up with 28 Fugitive
Blots after you next deregistration.  The Blot amnesty took care of your 28
real Blots (no end of Probate ever properly occured).  A month went by and your
Fugitive Blots were halved to 14.  Then you re-registered.  Again,  Welcome
Back.  8)  Hope this is clear.

Only one comment.  While I agree it might be reasonable to interpret "entity"
in such a way as to exclude fictitous persons (I am not convinced it is really
justified, but I'm open minded), I don't think it is reasonable to consider
that being dead for a long time causes one to become a fictitous person.  On
the other hand, if I'm recalling the classical part of my education correctly,
there may be some question as to whether there ever was a real Plato, since I
think all we have are Socrates writings about him, no writings directly
attributable to Plato.

#I (Kolja A.) move to the Embassy.

You are in the Embassy.

#look

You are in the Embassy. You see an office with a desk full of papers,
including the current Internomic ruleset, a book on orthography and
Agora's Initial rule set. Apart from the paperwork on the desk the
room does not appear to be used much. The pot plants have not been
watered much recently. On the wall you see a Portrait of Peter
Suber. 

Andre is here.

This wasn't to the PF, but you only need to tell the Cartographor if
you move, so if Morendil is reading agora-discussion, this is
legitimate.  I have you down as Off Hold now under that assumption.

You may be right.  Wouldn't be the first time my memory failed me.  8)
Of course, in that case, I would definitely object to considering Plato to be a
"fictitous person".

Would it be possible to...: Yes, in a sense that's what we're doing now,

Abuse of voting rights: The Speaker could vote AGAINST a proposal that
e did like, if that would not change the status of the vote on that
proposal. That way, the proposer would get less or lose more points.

Well, why not...

A young man with long hair, sitting behind a computer monitor. He should
be doing his job, but doesn't. He's playing Agora instead.
Andre is in perfect health.
Andre is carrying:
 A Crystal Cup

No, you're interpolating a "to" that isn't there. I request, then
move and Rebel - present tense, indicative, in all three cases - and 
the complement of 'request' is the infinitive. BTW, is 'request' in the 
above transitive or intransitive, I never can get that straight...

It doesn't. I am merely arguing that for all intents and purposes,
the "Plato" referred to in the controversial Transfer Order is a
fictitious entity; that is, no such person exists, or was such that
it would make any difference if they had existed.

Haven't you got that the wrong way round ?

Interesting. Actually, I missed Andre's message - or if I did read
it, I made no conscious record of it (i.e. didn't move it to my
'Cartographor' folder, or some such thing (then again I don't have
such a folder; a-b serves as such for the moment, and I look for
motion messages some time after the fact using text searches)).

It's quite possible that I received this message as part of a-d but
never really read it; sometimes when mail overload threatens I'll
just skip a whole bunch of a-d posts. 

>From judicial precedent Andre would probably have a case in
asserting that the message was actually sent to me; I do read a-d
usually, and it did enter my "domain of control". But then again, we 
also have precedent (or do we ?) to the effect that Officers aren't 
required to take note of posts to a-d.

Is Andre really Off Hold ?

Actually, e reposted this message to the PF later - you may be reading now.

Interesting. Actually, I missed Andre's message - or if I did read
it, I made no conscious record of it (i.e. didn't move it to my
'Cartographor' folder, or some such thing (then again I don't have
such a folder; a-b serves as such for the moment, and I look for
motion messages some time after the fact using text searches)).

It's quite possible that I received this message as part of a-d but
never really read it; sometimes when mail overload threatens I'll
just skip a whole bunch of a-d posts. 

>From judicial precedent Andre would probably have a case in
asserting that the message was actually sent to me; I do read a-d
usually, and it did enter my "domain of control". But then again, we 
also have precedent (or do we ?) to the effect that Officers aren't 
required to take note of posts to a-d.

Is Andre really Off Hold ?

Yeah, but at least this time you've been told for sure, so the
movement does work. :-)

I'm not sure I understand this.  "For all intents and purposes".  Are you
saying that Plato is not a fictitous person, but we can pretend he is (he may
as well be fictitous?), as far as the Rules are concerned, because he's been
dead long enough?

Actually, I agree with you, Steve, Michael, Scott etc. that this is the way it
should be.  However, I'm not sure setting a precedent making these kinds of
presumptions (here we are presuming the legal fiction that Plato is fictituous)
automatically a part of the game is really in the best interests of the game.

Oops.  Now that you and Kolja have pointed it out, I realize I did have that
backwards.

I don't feel strongly one way or the other, but if you do make the
CotC apply to someone else, I would probably make it the Justiciar.

Definitely. This "Plato" was an entity 'pulled out of thin air', as
it were, and my point was that using the name "Homer", for instance,
would have made no difference at all. But this is not an arbitrary
decision, which is what you seem to think is implied. I am not
labelling "Plato" as a fictitious entity merely because that is
convenient, but because in the context of Agora that is what it
amounts to - and I also insist on my point that the same kind of
reasoning would apply in a RL legal decision.

Hm, bounce me a working draft.  I've had a reform involving

Thanks, so I did understand your point.  Good.  You will get no argument from
me that this reasoning would apply in a RL legal decision.  I wouldn't say that
your decision was arbitrary, but that it attempted to make an RL parallel that
I didn't think was appropriate.  That's where we will probably still disagree. 
I don't think the context of Agora makes Plato, for all intents and purposes, a
fictitious person.  But I am content to live with this disagreement.  8)

Lots more work for the Rulekeepor and Wizard for a

Never ask why about initial sets; initial sets are not supposed
to be ideal sets.

If an Office is held Indefinitely, is that *in addition to* it being
held in the normal fashion, or *instead of* being held in the
normal fashion?  It's not clear here, but I'd probably say that
given this wording it's in addition to, but either way it
should be cleared up.

It _has_ adapted.  You could read the report, right?

Save your complaints for those MIME messages that use unnecessary base64
encoding.  (Such as, alas, any text file attached by pine.)

Greetings,

This is ambiguous. It could mean that a Player who declares Absence
and then votes is 'not considered to have voted solely due to that
declaration [of Absence].' Ie they are not considered to have voted
at all.

My idea was as follows:

1.) Amend Rule 408 by inserting the following text after the first paragraph:

However, if the Player sends a Judgement after the end of the permitted
deliberation period (but no more than a week after), then the CotC is
permitted to accept it as a legal judgement nonetheless.

2.) Amend Rule 591 by replacing
                                  A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

with

                                  A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk, except as permitted by other Rules.

and by replacing

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.

with

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ within the assigned deliberation
      period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

... and likewise amend the dismissal and appeal decision Rules.

Stars and Stripes Forever is at least likely to have a one time effect,
and will repeal itself in any case. Neither virtue attaches to R1744.

Transitive verbs take a direct object, either expressed or implicit.
'to move to the Beer Hall' is not an object, so my guess is that
'request' is operating as an intransitive verb.

And Chuck's too, apparently. That's good enough for me. The next

Actually, I can think of another, more important difference, one which I
like less: in your system, the CotC can reject a late Judgement if he
doesn't like it. In my system, the CotC can reject an Application for
an Extension - but e doesn't get to see the Judgement first. Once e's
granted the extension, e has to accept the Judgement whether e likes it
or not.

Why don't you finish working this up into a proto?

Proto-Proposal
Judicial Extensions

[Comment: v1.1: changed Speaker to Justiciar.]

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Extension of time for
Judging" be created with the following text:

      A Judge or Justice other than the Clerk of the Courts who has
      been selected to Judge a CFJ or an Appeal may seek an extension
      of the one week normally provided for the delivery of a
      Judgement by submitting an Application for an Extension to the
      Clerk of the Courts. The Clerk of the Courts may seek an
      extension by submitting an Application for an Extension to the
      Justiciar. An Application for an Extension cannot legally be
      executed unless it clearly indicates for which CFJ or Appeal
      an extension is being sought.

      The Clerk of the Courts (or the Justiciar, if the Sponsor of the
      Application is the Clerk of the Courts) is authorized to grant
      the extension provided that the Sponsor of the Application is
      still required to deliver Judgement on the CFJ or Appeal named
      in the Application, and that such an extension has not already
      been granted to its Sponsor. The Clerk of the Courts (or the
      Justiciar, as above) grants the extension by indicating in the
      Public Forum that e is doing so.

      If an extension is granted, its effect is to extend by one
      week the time provided to the Sponsor of the Application for
      the delivery of Judgement on the CFJ or Appeal named in the
      Application. That is, the Judge or Justice has 14 days from
      the time of eir original selection in which to deliver
      Judgement, and provided that e does so within that period, e
      shall not be made ineligible to Judge, nor suffer any
      penalties, for failure to deliver Judgement, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

True, but in that case, the process is about as complex (actually, 
just slightly more complex) than if my proto were adopted. It's
more complex because now we have two Officers needing to seek a
successor (the original holder and then the Speaker), rather than
just one. So in the case that there is a willing successor, my
proto slightly streamlines matters.

No it isn't, and yet we've seen again and again that in the event, it
isn't always possible, largely because we often don't get much warning
of the necessity to go On Hold or deregister.

I'm a lot happier with the idea I put forward in one of my recent
protos, where a late Judgement is accepted but fined (rather heavily,
in fact).

This is true for the Probate of entities whose destruction is deferred
by Rule 1601, but not for Players.  Players get one Probate per
deregistration.

Historical reasons. Originally, the Speaker was unable to vote (but 
had a veto power). Nowadays, nothing (AFAIK) in the rules refers to 
Voters instead of Players (am I wrong?).

Yes, you are.

Rule 1043/3 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Voter may deregister from Agora by sending a message to the
      Public Forum announcing eir deregistration. A Voter who
      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em to
      reregister before the beginning of the next month are without
      effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause
      em to be reregistered before the beginning of the next month.

      Other Rules may define other conditions under which Voters may
      be deregistered.

What with the pending CFJ, I'm not sure when Morendil was actually
re-registered, so that doesn't appear in the report.  However eir
reregistration message made it clear that e is definitely reregistered now, so
the penalty has been assessed - I'm pretty sure I sent that to the PF.  I
wasn't able to do this until today, so it will show up in next week's report.

Other way 'round: Socrates is the one who may or may not have been real, since
