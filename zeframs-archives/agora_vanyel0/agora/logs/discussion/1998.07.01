I agree. The three for-votes needed before the abolition of presence

Just to encourage others who are hesitating: I have voted for this, as
well. So with Harlequin, Steve and Chuck voting for (I _do_ hope you

I do hope we don't have to put such obvious principles into a rule -
of course what this rule demands is the only reasonable way to deal
with things, but I think we should establish this on the level of game
custom and, if necessary, CFJ. In fact, I believe that game custom
already is strong enough that these principles should stand even under
sharp scrutiny by the courts. I would appeal judgements that ignore
such simple principles of rules interpretations, becasue they are both
against game custom and the interest of the game.

I'm of the opinion that interpretation of words in accordance
with natural usage is part of "commonsense" mentioned in R217.

And even more so, against common sense.

Actually, Steve already vacated that (IMO, invalid) PO, so this transfer fails
in any case.

Tax question

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

I have a question about the wording in this Rule.  I have levied a tax on VTs
as required here.  But the VTPP remains above the VTCL until enough Players
have paid the tax.  In this case, the VTPP finally fell below 9 two days after
the original announcement.  Obviously it's impossible and against common sense
for the Accountor to levy taxes an infinite number of times while waiting for
the VTPP to drop enough.  But how do we determine when another levy is actually
required?  After all tax POs have been satisfied?  Should this rule be amended
to be more specific?

I don't know about the others, but to the last question, yes!  I
would suggest that a simple method would be to redefine the VTCL
to be (VTs owned by non-Bank entities) - (VT POs from non-Bank entities
to the Bank).

Why does the transfer fail? We repealed 'Inadvertant Transfers to the
Bank'. Doesn't Macross have to vacate the TO? This will result in
your having to transfer his Indulgence back to him.

Yes, I think so.

Re: DIS: RE: Re: OFF: CFJ 1099 (assigned to Murphy)

Rule 1598/7 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.  If a Transfer Order
      purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order and either that
      Payment Order does not exist or cannot be satisfied by the
      Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is invalid.

The last sentence of this Rule makes macross's TO invalid. It replaced
"Inadvertent Transfers".

I'll let it play out until and unless I feel that it's making play of the
game difficult. If no one can get even well-desired Proposals enacted with
any regularity, I'm not going to wait for another month for it to fix itself.
