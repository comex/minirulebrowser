Although I didn't think so when I wrote my post, I now also take that
view. The Judge may reasonably think that this means that the Statement
is trivially TRUE, since if a TO can't be made, it cannot be satisfied.
On the other hand, the Judge may consider that the Statement now
addresses the question of whether such a TO could be satisfied if it
could in fact be made.

Are you planning on going on Hold, because you are about to become
Speaker, as soon as Michael announces the transition.
(Speaking of which, I am also owed my Speaker's Gratuity for last 
month.)

I'll take on some of your Offices, if you want, as long as I can
pass them back before July 22 (when I am travelling to another 
conference.)

Because I am Speaker, and becuase I will only be gone for a week
ot thereabouts, I will not be going On Hold.

Maybe in addition to the Repeal-O-Matic we should have a Suspend-O-Matic 
which would append something like the Viral sentence (in its second
incarnation) to the text of a Rule. Players would then be voting to
suspend the operation of that Rule for a period of time, say, a month.
