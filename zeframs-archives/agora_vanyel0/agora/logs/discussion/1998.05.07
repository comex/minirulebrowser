----------------------------------------------------------------------

Let it come to pass that Rules 1657 and 417 be repealed, and that rule
1370 be amended to replace all occurrences there of "Archivist" with
"Herald", and that rule 786 be amended to delete the line reading "the
Archivist".

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, let's face it, when was the last time the Archivist did
anything? 

Can Steve produce copies of all the Theses, and the fate of all
proposals going back to year dot, and a historical ruleset? 

I doubt it.  What's more, no-one seems to want this stuff.  And for
this do nothing job, some worthy gets 2 VTs a week, more than the
Assessor and the Accountor. 

Any strong objections?

Michael.

Vizier Harlequin, could I please get that Iris info?

Kolja, I think your objection lacks foundation, but I'm not going to
bother CFJing on it.

Proto:  Avoid Probate delay

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text "after the Trustee has received
all of the reports required by the previous paragraph" with "after the
Trustee's appointment is announced by the Notary".

Yep.

In my view, the Archivist's job is to ensure that none of Agora's official
history risks getting lost.  If e does eir job to this spirit, I say e
deserves eir Salary (if not more), and should be kept.

Of course, there might be strong suspicions around that prior Archivists
have not done their job properly, and so parts of our history _have_ been
lost.  Unfortunately the job description has never included what I
consider to be its real spirit.

For example, given the fact that Players have often dropped out of the
game without warning, this plainly and obviously demands occasional extra
backups placed in the care of other Players than the Archivist.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

At the risk of being repetitive, I'd like to restate that I have full 
archives of n-o and n-b going back to October 95, plus (I think)
nearly all of n-d for that same period.

If anyone has extra disk space lying around, e's welcome to those...
Actually I've though once or twice of burning that info on a few
WORM discs and mailing that to Players with an interest in a raw
but extensive historical record. I don't have access to a CD recorder 
right now but that could be arranged if anyone expresses interest. I
might do that sometime anyway even if nobody cares, just so I can
delete the stuff from my hard disk. ;)

On a different subject, here's an idea I've always vaguely wanted to
try: do you think, Morendil, that it would be possible and practical
to graph volume on the lists (measured either as number of messages
or as bandwidth) against time for the period for which you have complete
records? I'd be particularly interested in seeing if this graph had
any fractal properties.

You'd probably need a better Perl hacker than I, but the tools to do
it certainly are around. I'm sure I remember about one or two
graphics/charting packages for Perl, the rest is just a matter of
counting lines or messages, and interpreting Date: headers correctly
(probably the trickiest part). For that matter, I could probably
even do it in Java my language of choice, if I had a little more
spare time.

Hmm, since both of these passed, doesn't the repeal of 1706, which took place
first, make this amendment fail?  I haven't looked at it closely enough yet,
but I suspect Plots may be broken before it got off the ground.

VT supply is in much better shape that it has been, but finely
balanced it is not quite yet. Salaries put about 21 VTs/week into
the economy, and unemployment benefits about another 5. R833 has
been adding about another 4 VTs/week, but your Proposal to amend
it has just taken effect. So let's say that roughly 26 VTs/week 
are entering circulation. Now, my recent amendment to R955 has
succeeded, I think, in increasing VT expenditure somewhat, but
still I'd say that only 10-15 VTs a week are being spent voting on
Proposals. So before the effect of Plots is considered, there's
still a gap of about 11-16 VTs/week between inputs and expenditure.
That's a lot better than it has been in the past, but we've still
work to do. Of course I agree with you that the adoption of Plots is
is a step backwards that is only going to make things worse.

However, my Proposal 'The Levers of Monetary Policy' offers the
prospect of some relief from this situation, since the Chancellor
will be able to reduce the BOS in response to VT oversupply. The
adoption of Plots unfortunately halves the length of this lever,
with Plots in place, Salaries will only account for about half
of VT supply. Even reducing Salaries to zero may not be enough
to counter the effect of Plots, if they are used to maximum effect.
It will be interesting to see how the Chancellor responds to
conflicting political pressures to reign in supply on the one hand,
and pay Officers for the work they do on the other. And if things
get too out of hand, the Accountor can use the other lever of taxes
to keep VTs scarce while we work on the balancing problem. The upshot
is that the adoption of Plots has made the adoption of 'The Levers
of Monetary Policy' even more urgent, and I repeat my call for
Players with P-Notes to spend some of them raising the Priority
of this Proposal to 3 before the end of the Week. I'd do it myself,
but I have no P-Notes. 

I'll tell you what: I'll offer 2 VTs to each Player who spends a
P-Note to raise the Priority of 'Levers', until its Priority is 3.

Any takers?

If Proposal 3740 in fact repealed Rule 1706, then it would be
impossible for Proposal 3741 to amend it.

Proto-Proposal
A Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: I can think of couple of ways to encourage expenditure
of VTs above the minimum required to pass a Proposal. Here's one
of them: secret voting. If Players can't be sure if a Proposal
they like has met Quorum and has at least 3 supporters, they'll
have to think harder about supporting it themselves. (And similarly
for Proposals they don't like.) We've had 6 months of public voting,
and it's been interesting and fun, but maybe a couple of months of
secret voting might be equally interesting and fun! Anyway, the
approach I've taken here is the same as that which I took when
introducing the Public Voting Experiment back in November of last
year: a 2 month trial with a built-in sunset clause. If secret
voting doesn't have the effect of increasing VT expenditure, or
if it has other effects we don't like, we just let the trial period
expire and go back to our current system.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1764 (Public Voting) be amended by
appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall have no effect.
      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, it
      deletes itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule entitled "Secret Voting" be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.) 

      A Player who sends a message containing votes on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum to the Public Forum commits the
      Infraction of Public Voting. The commission of this Infraction
      is to be detected and reported by the Vote Collector; the
      penalty is 1 Voting Token and 1 Blot.


      Two months after is created, this Rule repeals itself.

Proto-Proposal
Permit Electioneering!

[Comment: as a companion to my Secret Voting Experiment proto, a
proto to permit Electioneering. This would be proposed at the same
time as 'A Secret Voting Experiment', but would be a separate
Proposal. The idea may seem outrageous, but I think it has merit.
We've been busily giving all kinds of interesting powers to the
Promotor, the Chancellor and the Speaker (and I've just proposed
some for the Accountor, too) - why not give some real power to the
Assessor and the Registrar, and make these Offices *really*
attractive and important?]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by
Vote Collectors) be amended by appending to it a paragraph which
reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rules, it
      deletes itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1625 (Secrecy of Voting) be
amended by appending to it a paragraph which reads: 

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rules, it
      deletes itself.

Let me qualify that offer by adding that I won't make it available
to smarty-pants who spend the P-Note and then vacate the transfer.

By 'a message containing votes' I don't mean 'a message containing
a description of votes', but rather 'a message whose effect is
actually to cast votes'. But I take your point that this is not clear
enough. If I don't make this distinction clearly enough, the Rule
will also conflict with the discussion provisions in R1023. I don't
think there's any point in trying to prevent people from discussing
their votes, both for the reason that it's a bad idea, and that even
if it were a good idea, it would be impossible.

Irrelevant as this may seem, my answer would definitely be "yes." It
obviously still *is* a Wall. The exemption, at least as worded there,
doesn't temporarily make it a "not-Wall"; it just allows it to do something
it normally can't.

Outstanding. Plots is almost completely neutered by the passage of 3740
just one infintesimal unit of time before it. (As much as I've supported
Plots in the past, I've changed my mind: I will now almost certainly vote
AGAINST further attempts to make it work. I, too, prefer our current
direction on monetary policy.)

Thankfully, Plots only has a single relevant amendment to a non-Agoraverse
rule, and that is a fairly benign one (it causes Ergs to be paid out to new
players.) The rest of the mess it's made should be fairly easy to undo with
a new Proposal.
