I had already read the version in the Queue, and didn't feel the need to
reread it again in the distribution.

them.

Well, the flip answer to this problem is to get rid of payments for
voting. :)

However, the real response is to note that someone has to do it.  Why
shouldn't the entity indebted to be responsible to check to see
whether the debts due have been paid in a timely manner?  Raise the
Chancellor's salary if this is so terribly onerous.

I object. We have game custom from the Great Officer's Veto Scam that in
a distribution in which one of the Proposals has had its text
substantially altered (so that it does not count as having been legally
distributed), the legality of the distribution of the other Proposals is
not affected. This is consistent with R1770, which requires of the
Promotor that e "distribute each Proposal in the batch", and states that
"[o]nce a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Queue."
These requirements exist for each Proposal separately, and can thus be
satisfied separately.

Obviously, once in a very long while, such a procedure will trip you up.
But the consequences are trivial in that case: if the text which is
distributed is not the same as the text which was submitted (in whatever
sense of 'the same' the Courts settle upon), then the Proposal has not
been distributed at all, and you will not turn out to have cast any
votes on anything.

It doesn't have the opposite effect. It does always decrease the
"advantage" of not voting, because it reduces the price difference
between voting and not voting. But in some cases (where the Voting
Tariff is larger than one) it doesn't do this job 100%, I admit that.

That's moving the goalposts! The point of considering the reform of the
current system is to see if the total amount of work can be considerably
lessened, and not just to shift it around. That was what Crito was
asking you about, and what your remark was responding to. If it really
is true that "someone has got to do it", then you haven't made a case
for moving from the current system, in which that someone is mostly the
Accountor (since most debts to the Bank are VT debts), to a system in
which that someone is the Chancellor. Raising the Chancellor's Salary is
hardly the solution, for there is some suggestion that the amount of
work being generated is reaching the limit of what an ordinary person is
prepared to commit themselves to undertake in the course of playing a
game. That seems to have been the experience of the last 3 Accountors
(Crito, Blob and now lee.) If that is so, and if it really is the case
that the amount of work cannot be significantly lessened, then our
choices, it seems to me, are limited to two:

1. Dismantle the economy (as you suggest above).
2. Develop tools to handle automatically the work which is generated,
with the aim of lightening the burden of time on individual Players.

Since (1) is regressive, and does not in itself suggest what we ought to
do with ourselves after we have admitted complete defeat and dismantled
the economy, I tend to favour (2), which, despite the perils, at least
offers a way forward into new and interesting conceptual territory for
the game. And doesn't it strike you as ironic that a game played
entirely over the Internet has such a fear of technology?

I don't see how you could argue that P3801 was not
distributed. _Something_ _was_ distributed, and the only problem is
that what was distributed under the name of P3800 wasn't really the
proposal with this number. But I think variant 2 of Scott's,

is correct. It also agrees with the "appendix" in which I stated my
general view of the situation at the and of my CFJ1089 judgement,

>>
Although it isn't strictly relevant to this statement for judgement, I
would like to add that the above arguments imply that the text
distributed wasn't proposal 3710, either. According to this
interpretation, P3710 is still in the proposal queue; the Promotor
broke the rules governing the distribution of proposals because e did
not yet distribute it, and, in addition, published wrong proposal
queue listings. Additionally, one might argue that the votes that
players and other voting entities tried to cast on P3710 were cast
before the voting period on this proposal began and were thus illegal
according to Rule 683/5 (Legal Votes). They should also not have led
to POs according to 1442. The attempt to make the proposal a Senate
Proposal was ineffective for the same reason.
<<

I would especially like to say that the wannabe "votes" on P3800 sent
so far were, in fact, messages with no effect, just as if I would now
send a message to the PF stating that "I hereby declare presence on
P4500".

But why should anyone care about the price difference between voting and
not voting? Or rather, why should we be satisfied with any situation in
which there is a price difference between voting and not voting, to the
advantage of not voting? As long as not voting is significantly cheaper
than voting, there will be a strong incentive not to vote provided by 'A
Duty to Vote'. The fact that the incentive would have been even stronger
had 'A Duty to Vote' not existed does mitigate the criticism somewhat,
but only a little. It's as if you were confronted with a strong swimmer
who notices 5 people drowning in the surf; he rescues 1 of them, but
then, despite clearly having the capability of going back to rescue more
of the others, he brushes the sand off himself and declares that his
work is done. What can you say to such a person? It seems to me that
what you (and Blob and Scott) want to say to him is: thanks - that was
terrific work you did saving that person's life. Meanwhile, I'm left
scratching my head and wondering "yes, sure, but what about the others?"

I think there are good reasons to increase the danger of Rebellion. At
the moment, it doesn't really matter if your Rebellion fails, because,
although all the Rebels get 2 Blots (and the leader 4), they needn't
worry too much about them, since they can always try again next week,
and again and again until they succeed, whereupon they all get a Blot
amnesty. If there are 5 Rebels among 15 Players, the chance of Revolt in
any given week is only 1/3 (assume for the same of simplicity that there
is no Miscreant (R1837)). But the chance of Revolt in a 4 week period is
[1 - (2/3)^4], or 80.24% Those are pretty good odds! (I was about to
add: you can't stay Rebellious longer than 4 weeks, because then you get
hit with Inciting to Riot (R1840), and become Abiding again. But so
what? There's nothing to prevent you from immediately rejoining the
Rebels. So in fact the Rebels can try 5 weeks in a row, or 6, or
whatever.)

However, I've been thinking further about Macross' proposal, and I'm not
sure it does the trick. The trouble is that if the Indulgence system is
working properly (in particular, the Lottery (R1712)), then there should
always be roughly the same number of Indulgences as there are Blots. So,
contrary to Macross' statement above, there *is* a kind of rough
guarantee that the non-Rebels will have enough Indulgences to cover the
Blots of the Rebels - as long as you assume that all or most of the
Players with Blots are in the Rebel camp, which is a pretty reasonable
assumption.

Well, in fact it's a little bit more tricky than that, because of timing
issues. Assume that Blots and Indulgences are roughly in balance to
begin with. As above, assume there are 5 Rebels. The leader Calls for
Revolt on a Wednesday. The Registrar rolls eir die, and the Revolt is
unsuccessful. So the Registrar duly hits the Rebels with 2 Blots each,
plus another 2 for the leader. That's 14 Blots. So for the moment there
is a definite imbalance between Blots and Indulgences. But come the
beginning of the following Week, the Herald is going to be required to
distribute Indulgences to restore rough balance. Clearly, in the
situation in which Macross' proposal has been adopted and the successful
Rebels seize the Indulgences of the non-Rebels, the Rebels are going to
want to wait until after the Herald had distributed the Indulgences
before making another Call for Revolt. The Rebels have the advantage,
however: the Herald is required to distributed the Indulgences as soon
as possible after the beginning of the Week, while the Rebels are under
no obligation at all to call for Revolt, and can simply afford to
outwait the Herald - assuming, of course, that the Herald is not emself
a Rebel, and so not simply co-operating with them by distributing
Indulgences early in the Week.

So if Macross' proposal doesn't actually increase the risk of Rebellion
(it still neatly solves the problem of the Blot/Indulgence imbalance,
and should perhaps be adopted just for that reason), what would do so?
Obviously, a substantial increase in the Blot penalty for a failed
Rebellion (to, say, 6 Blots, and 10 for the leader) would increase the
risk, especially if it were combined with a lowering of the threshhold
for Lawlessness to, say, 20 Blots. But that's just one idea.

The system I'm developing does not _require_ the Chancellor to match
up payments with debts (at least not yet).  E could do nothing (in
which case people could probably get away without paying their debts),
or e could agree to trust some other person--or automated system--to
do it for em.  (An enterprising Recordkeepor could offer to provide
this service for a small weekly fee, for example.)  The system I am
working on does substantially reduce duties in the general case, at
the possible cost of increased work in the event of a dispute--but
disputes seem to be the exception, and I suspect the net payoff is
positive.

Another would be to make the penalty proportional to the number of Blots
already held, possibly even balancing the expected gain and loss.

Re: DIS: Failure to Report? 

So Officers would be permitted to transfer funds from the Bank to pay out
salaries and rewards directly (I must have missed that)?  That will be a nice
reduction of paperwork.  But what is the difference between "matching transfers
to debts" and "checking to see if a transfer satisfies a debt"?  I guess you
mean the Chancellor will only have to keep track of the total indebtedness of
each Player for each Currency, reducing or increasing that based on transfers
and Notices?

No, you have misunderstood.  The Chancellor only has to match
transfers to debts with respect to debts owed to the Bank.  And nobody
has to check to see if any transfer satisfies a debt.

Protoproposal Chaos24 [rev. 3]

No Retroactivity

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created with a
Power of 3:

      No action by any Player may have, as a direct or indirect
      consequence, the effect of changing any part of the Game State
      prior to the moment at which that action occured.  Any change
      which the Rules might seek to require to occur at a time prior

No, the Chancellor will still need to make transfers sufficient to
match the debts imposed _on_ the Bank, the same as would the executor
of any other entity.  There is nothing special about the Bank (or the
Chancellor) in the system I am developing, at least not in its present
form.

Re: DIS: Failure to Report?

I must be particularly dense today.  It seems to me, from your explanation
below, that the new system you are proposing merely changes the *name* from
"Payment Order" to "Notice of Debt" and requires the Chancellor to keep track
of them for all Currencies.  I don't see this as an improvement.

This is not what I am suggesting at all, although to an extent it has
this effect, insofar as most Payment Orders are executed either to or
from the Bank.  However, since the Chancellor is presently required in
fact (if not in law) to keep track of Payment Order naming the Bank as
Payor, I don't see how the change I am suggesting creates any
substantially greater burden for the Chancellor.

Re: DIS: Failure to Report?

I have yet to see a PO that did not involve the Bank as Payor or Payee.  Under
this new plan, the Chancellor will have to keep track of *all* Notices of Debt
involving the Bank (meaning all, as it stands) and their corresponding
transfers, not just those involving the Bank as debtor.  This *is* a
substantial increase in the Chancellor's burden.

I suppose.  When I was Chancellor I kept track of them anyway.

However, I don't see you offering a solution that reduces the overall
amount of work.  I tend to think that debts are nothing more than
legal obligations to pay, and that it makes poor sense to require the
currency recordkeepor to keep track of such obligations.  Instead, the
entity which is obliged to should be the one that does that.

There is no way for the Chancellor to evade having to know about when
the Bank is obliged to pay someone, since that is a duty the
Chancellor necessarily must perform.  The only question is where we
place the duty of keeping track of obligations to pay the Bank.  I
don't think distributing this amongst the Currency Recordkeepors is
all that good an idea, and you are objecting to assigning it to the
Chancellor.  Who else would you suggest?  The alternative is to simply
not keep track of them, which seems to me to be a bad idea.

So it would impose a penalty one someone who "fails to vote on at least one
Proposal in the Batch".  

This suffers from the same ambiguity:  is this maybe penalizing someone who
"fails to vote" on at least one Proposal?

Re: DIS: Failure to Report?

You're right, time for some *constructive* criticism from me.  8)

Ok, here's what I can think of, off the top of my head.

1.  Forget about needing an Executor for the Bank.  Whenever the Rules
authorize currency to be paid out of the Bank, let the Rules authorize the
relevant Officer to make the transfer directly and without the need for any
Notice of Debt.  This alone would cut down the paperwork immensely - no more
matching TOs to POs for salaries and awards; no more waiting till both a PO and
TO have been issued before you get your money.

2.  Use your idea of "Notice of Debt", but forget about matching transfers to
Notices directly.  Allow the Recordkeepor or the entity to whom the debt is
owed (Chancellor, in case of the Bank) simply to keep track of total
indebtedness.  A transfer reduces indebtedness, a Notice increases it.

3.  If we want to keep PI, authorize whoever keeps track of indebtedness to
penalize Players for PI based on the dates of Notice - a transfer always
reduces the oldest Notice(s).

I suppose.  When I was Chancellor I kept track of them anyway.

However, I don't see you offering a solution that reduces the overall
amount of work.  I tend to think that debts are nothing more than
legal obligations to pay, and that it makes poor sense to require the
currency recordkeepor to keep track of such obligations.  Instead, the
entity which is obliged to should be the one that does that.

There is no way for the Chancellor to evade having to know about when
the Bank is obliged to pay someone, since that is a duty the
Chancellor necessarily must perform.  The only question is where we
place the duty of keeping track of obligations to pay the Bank.  I
don't think distributing this amongst the Currency Recordkeepors is
all that good an idea, and you are objecting to assigning it to the
Chancellor.  Who else would you suggest?  The alternative is to simply
not keep track of them, which seems to me to be a bad idea.

Re: DIS: proto: Tweak 'A Duty to Vote'

I don't see the ambiguity.  "Penalizing someone on at least one Proposal"
doesn't make any sense to me in the context of this Rule, so how do you justify
this as a second interpretation?

So it would impose a penalty one someone who "fails to vote on at least one
Proposal in the Batch".  

This suffers from the same ambiguity:  is this maybe penalizing someone who
"fails to vote" on at least one Proposal?

I disagree.  If the method in use by one assessor proves simpler to use, why
would that necessarily mean that the next assessor would have a harder time?
In fact, I think the exact opposite would be true.

Customization does not imply a lack of simplification.  In fact, the whole
point of allowing customization is that Players will naturally try to
customize the recordkeeping so that it is simpler.  If it does become
simpler this will allow inexperienced players to succeed at offices they
otherwise might not dare attempt for fear of ending up in the exact type of
mess that Lee is in now.

Yes, Lee's problems are due to the volume of records that must be
maintained.  You would rather decide for Lee what system might be better to
handle that volume of records.  I, on the other hand, would allow Lee to
make that decision emself.  Further, I am considering offering my services,
at a fee, in the way of automating the entire process.  I will lease the use
of my automated system to officers.  The system will distill the huge mass
of raw data into a form that can easily be turned into an official report.
I will also allow players, for a small fee, to have instant access to the
current state of their finances as known by the automated server.  I think
this will greatly simplify recordkeeping and will be well worth the price of
admission.


> Simplification is the issue, as

Yes, it is the issue.  That's why I propose to only require an accurate
record of the Recordkeepor.  This will allow them to determine how best (and
simplest) to arrive at that accurate record.

I certainly favor you monthly salary proposal.  However, it does not in any
way, shape or form simplify the processes of maintaining the records.
That's like saying that I simplify the method of solving the Rubik's Cube by
only handing you 1 to solve instead of 5.  The process is still just as
complicated, it just needs to be applied less often.  This reduces the
burden of the job, but doesn't simplify it in the least.

It would seem that this matching would simply be a matter of the Chancellor
making the transfer upon receiving the Notice of Debt.  Very simply done I
would think especially if the Notice is labelled Notice of Debt.

Okay. I'll accept this.

Not necessarily. Under the current rules, I could put a relatively 
innocuous proposal in the queue, publish the queue, and then swap it at
the last minute between reporting the Queue and distributing the 
Proposal.

Of course, if P3799 passes, I wouldn't be able to do this, because 
all new Proposals would have to be made to the PF.

The reason you don't understand my opposition to this change is because
you wrongly attribute to me your own motivations for supporting "A Duty 
to Vote" in the first place.

I supported "A Duty to Vote" because it was controversial. I oppose the
change you are suggesting, because it offends my sense of elegance, and
it removes what I think is an interesting dynamic relationship between
the Voting Tariff and the penalty for not voting. I actually don't 
feel all that strongly about whether or not the Duty works as a voting
incentive.

This sounds so much easier, I'm left wondering why we haven't been doing
it all along. Am I overlooking some obvious disadvantage?

No, the clause in question is:

"who fails to cast a vote on at least one Proposal in the batch"

This has two interpretations:

"who fails to (cast a vote on at least one Proposal in the batch)"

or:

"who (fails to cast a vote) on at least one Proposal in the batch"

The first one means that e voted on none of the proposals in the batch,
the second that there exists at least one proposal on which e didn't vote.
I take it that the first meaning is the desired one, and I suggest the
phrasing:

"who votes on none of the Proposals in the batch"

as unambiguous, I think.

RE: DIS: Failure to Report?

No.  This is only true for Notices for which the Bank is debtor.  The
Chancellor has no control over when another debtor will actually transfer funds
to the Bank.

It would seem that this matching would simply be a matter of the Chancellor
making the transfer upon receiving the Notice of Debt.  Very simply done I
would think especially if the Notice is labelled Notice of Debt.
