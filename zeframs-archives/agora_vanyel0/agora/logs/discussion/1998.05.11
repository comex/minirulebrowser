I agree that this goal is a worthy one.  That's why I wrote the rule
in the first place.  (And it was a while ago, R417 has a lovely low
number; the only earlier, non-initial rule is 376.)  Unfortunately, I
think you're right; the job is not described well and the spirit of
the job doesn't feature in its description. 

Moreover, we do at least have much of the raw material to hand in
Morendil's archives of everything since October 1995.  I think that
until we can think of a proper way of dealing with this situation (and
perhaps give the Archivist some interesting powers :-), the Office
should just be repealed.

Michael.

Just noticed that this wasn't to the PF.  Incidentally, I support your
proposed fix to the rule in question; I agree that having to keep
track of who's voted and when is otherwise quite a burden.

Yeah, definitely.  If Players really, really do want their own
Currency they can implement them with a form of deal similar to that
which I promised for my MV virtual currency.

Current direction?  What current direction?  There is no evidence to
suggest that we have a balanced system at present, and what's more I
believe the current system to be extremely unfair as the only
dependable inputs are Officer salaries.  (Check out this week's
Accountor's report to see how fair the distribution of VTs is.)

Thankfully, as Murphy's proposal has demonstrated, the fix to the
current broken situtation is easily made: just 50 lines.

The system is not balanced - yet - but progress is that direction is
clearly discernible. Just a few months ago, there were over 8,000 VTs
in circulation! Now, there are less than 200 hundred, and although
that number is increasing, it is increasing slowly.

I also disagree that the current system is extremely unfair. It is
true that the major inputs are Officer Salaries - but I regard that
as a fair outcome. Officers invest the most time in the game, and
it is their activities that allow the game to continue. It is 
appropriate that they be rewarded for this in terms that make sense
in the context of the game. If any Player is dissatisfied with their
VT income, they know what they must do: get Elected.

None of this is a direct argument against Plots, of course. In fact,
I'm not implacably opposed to Plots. But I am opposed to them in the
current economic environment. If we could find a way reliably to 
increase VT expenditure to, say, 30 VTs/week, I'd be happy to see
Officer Salaries reduced (by using the levers in LMP to reduce the BOS
to 0.75 VT) to account for, say, half of that, and let Plots take up
the slack. But first we need to see if we can increase VT expenditure.
I'm going to try to get my suite of 3 experimental Proposals distributed
next week, although of course much will depend on Promotor Crito's
choice of Batch Size. Crito?

If we adopt Plots now, then the only choice for a Chancellor who
wants to see a balanced economy (and what is your stance on that,
H. Chancellor?) will be basically to reduce the BOS to zero, assuming
LMO is adopted. I think that would be extremely unfair to Officers.

Proto-Proposal
A Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: I can think of couple of ways to encourage expenditure
of VTs above the minimum required to pass a Proposal. Here's one
of them: secret voting. If Players can't be sure if a Proposal
they like has met Quorum and has at least 3 supporters, they'll
have to think harder about supporting it themselves. (And similarly
for Proposals they don't like.) We've had 6 months of public voting,
and it's been interesting and fun, but maybe a couple of months of
secret voting might be equally interesting and fun! Anyway, the
approach I've taken here is the same as that which I took when
introducing the Public Voting Experiment back in November of last
year: a 2 month trial with a built-in sunset clause. If secret
voting doesn't have the effect of increasing VT expenditure, or
if it has other effects we don't like, we just let the trial period
expire and go back to our current system.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1764 (Public Voting) be amended by
appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall have no effect.
      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, it
      deletes itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule entitled "Secret Voting" be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.) 

      A Player who sends a message containing votes on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum to the Public Forum, prior to the
      conclusion of the Voting Period of that Proposal, Election, or
      Referendum, commits the Infraction of Public Voting. The
      commission of this Infraction is to be detected and reported by
      the Vote Collector; the penalty is 1 Voting Token and 1 Blot.

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

Variable Batch Size creates an interesting tension between the P-Note
and VT parts of the economy. On the one hand, a smaller Batch Size
can encourage increased P-Note expenditure if there is tough competition
for places in the distribution. That's good for keeping P-Notes scarce.
On the other hand, a smaller Batch Size decreases VT expenditure greatly.
If LMP is adopted, the Chancellor will be able to respond to this
situation by lowering the BOS in response to small Batch Sizes.

Swann,

I like the Ombudsman proto. I'm keen to see more broadly defined powers 
like this. It should make for some interesting judgements, among other
things.

"I Call for Judgement on the following statement: 

 The Ombudsman broke rule XXXX, because e did not act in the interests
 of Agora at large when e vote against proposal YYYY".

Could be an interesting case.

One thing I have long felt that Nomic lacks is representative democracy.
The politics of selecting a representative who is supposed to act in 
your interests, but is nevertheless free to do so in such a manner as e
sees fit, is a delightfully complicated issue.

Indeed.  Takes all the fun out of it.
