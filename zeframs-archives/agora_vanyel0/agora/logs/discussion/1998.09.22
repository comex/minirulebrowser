I can't really afford to vote for this, but I would like to see it pass,
if only to set the cat among the pidgeons. As I'm the Assessor, I can't 
buyback quorum either. I'll Electioneer on your behalf though. If I can
be of any other assistance, just say.

I request that the Rulekeepor unofficially annotate R1817 as follows:

[In CFJ 1107, the Judge ruled that a transfer that would result in an
entity possessing a negative amount of Currency cannot be noted out of
order by the Recordkeepor, and so cannot be obeyed if this condition
later ceases to be true.]

I am in support of this proposal.  However, I wish that it had been combined
with a few other housekeeping measures...  I don't think I want to pay a VT
for just this.

Arrrggghh! I can't believe I actually posted that to the discussion list!

Stupid, stupid, stupid! :(

PS: As it turns out, I may not be able to fulfill this promise anyway,
as I will be away most of next week. I'll still post my reports, but 
I won't be around much to "politick".
