A bit of discussion in French, dating back to March this year.  No one ever
did provide an English translation of any of this, would someone like to do
the honors?  Ditto for a similar message to follow.

Maybe.  I remember the following clearly enough:

1) The CFJ in question said something like "General Chaos had (8 to 10)
   Kudos at (time X)", and was Judged true.
2) This established that kelly == Scott, at least for the purposes of Agora.
3) kelly Left In A Huff.
4) According to some messages quoted by Vanyel, kelly was registered in
   October 1996.
5) You claimed to have registered in October 1996 and Left In A Huff a month
   later.

I never said it would be easy.  :)

Here are some ways this could become less troublesome:

* Title changes hands only when someone correctly reports that <condition>.
* One Title per Currency.
* Title can change hands only when <Registrar's / Currency> Report posted,
    and based solely on most recent Reports of relevance.

A possible counterargument to this is to reconsider the concept behind
t(x and !x) in the light of fuzzy logic:  Use "This apple is red" for x,
and consider an apple that is 3/4 red.  Then x is largely true, and !x is
a little true.  Also if you use rounding-off to convert back to binary
logic, then the maximum value of t(x)*t(!x) would be 1/4 which becomes 0.

I also seem to remember Kosko claiming that other formulas could also
work to an extent; I was going to actually bother looking it up this time
but I can't remember where that crate of books is located.

I'm guessing this translates as "Personally, I would Vote AGAINST, for
reasons that should be obvious."  How close am I?

Protoproposal Chaos18 [rev. 1]

Probate, Take Two

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.
 
      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1745 be repealed.

[An entity possessing stranded Currencies is placed in Probate
 instead.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee if:
      a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
      b) e ceases to be a Player;
      c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate; or
      d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.  

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

  I've been spurred by Scott's own example to adopt the policy of
posting a proto-decision to a-d before submitting an actual Judgement,
to elicit comments from other Justices as well as the populace. So far
that seems to make no difference - but I intend to adhere to that policy
nevertheless.

No cigar. Means "Personally, I'll Vote AGAINST, as many times as it takes."
