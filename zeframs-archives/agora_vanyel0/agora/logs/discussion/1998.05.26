Between the actions or the results?

If you mean telling the difference between the results, I would try to
make it as clear as possible in the way I express myself. In particular,
I hope I could make it very clear when I object to something at a meta-
game level. If needs be, I will explicitly say this is the case.

On the other hand, when I object on the in-game level, the rhetoric
might not be so clearly labelled (so as to not diminish its force), but
more than once in the past I have publicly lambasted a player for eir
actions, whilst privately congratulating em for a clever move. Morendil's
so-called "treasonous activity" is a case in point. My in-game and
meta-game opinions on the action were worlds apart, but I think I 
managed to make both of them clear.

But Morendil's so-called treasonous activities were not illegal and
so do not serve to make your point. My question is: how can you tell
the difference between a Player who commits a Crime and a Player who
disobeys the Rules? To me, they're just one and the same thing. Is
flagrant Electioneering an example of the first or the second kind?
Would it merit from you congratulations for clever play, or
recriminations at the meta-game level? Both?

If a player does an action which the rules say e may not do, e has
disobeyed the Rules.

If a player does an action which the rules say is a Crime, then e
has committed a Crime.

These definitions are not mutually exclusive, as your example shows.
Electioneering is both prohibited by the rules, and defined as a Crime.
Perjury, on the other hand, is a Crime, but is not expressly prohibited.

I cannot off-hand think of an example of an action that is solely 
prohibited by the rules and is not also a Crime, but that is to be 
expected. We recognise that in spite of the meta-game compulsion to 
obey the rules, it is still _possible_ for a player to disobey, and this
disobedience ought to have in-game consequences. Thus most of the 
common prohibited acts are also Crimes. That's what I understand the
Pragmatic viewpoint to be.

I see no difficulty whatsoever in determining the difference between 
the two. The rules appear to be very clear on what is permissable, and
what isn't, and what is a Crime and what isn't. Do you disagree?

Completely. My position is that anything that is defined as a Crime
is, by definition, expressly prohibited by the Rules. Nothing that
the Rules say is a Crime is permitted, although of course many of
those prohibited things are perfectly possible (otherwise we wouldn't
have to prohibit them).

And since Electioneering is expressly prohibited, I would not congratulate
a Player who broke the rules in that way. That is not to say that I 
think it should be prohibited. Personally, I would be happy to see 
it amended to just be a Crime. Then I would be happy to congratulate
a Player who cleverly committed the Crime and somehow managed to get
away with it. 

The basis for this view I think is this: Part of what we are doing 
here is to build a "world" in which we are role-playing. The world we
are creating is in some fashion a simulation of parts of the real world.
One of the things we simulate is crime and punishment. Just as in the
real world, it is possible for people to exploit the criminal system,
so it is in the game. Doing so ought to have negative consequences in
the game, but may be good play on the meta-level.

To disobey the rules, on the other hand, is to decide you are not 
going to be part of the simulation. This is not praise-worthy. Just
as there is nothing clever about hacking a computer game to give yourself
a big high-score, there is also nothing clever about breaking the rules
in Nomic, to achieve some in-game goal. There may be some people who
admire the ability to break things in this way, but it doesn't prove
that you are any good at the game.

Out of interest, on what do you base this judgement? Nothing in the 
rules seems to indicate that actions that are Crimes are prohibited, 
unless it is implicit in the word "Crime" itself. 

To pick an example, If I commit Perjury, which rule have I disobeyed?

Since you are correct that the Rules do not say explicitly that
Crimes are prohibited, I think I have to say that this prohibition
is implicit in the word "Crime" itself.

I'm curious: would you say that a basketball player who commits a
professional foul does something which is prohibited by the rules
of basketball? I would say unequivocally yes. But by your own
account, this same answer commits you to saying that this player has
decided not to play basketball at all and is wasting everybody's time. 
Yet professional fouls are an accepted part of basketball play.

I'm not claiming that Agoran Crimes are all like professional fouls.
I don't think we've drawn our distinctions carefully enough for that.
Some of them probably are while others aren't. My point is rather
this: If we wanted to go through the Ruleset carefully marking which
actions are to be acceptable although penalizable and which simply
not acceptable, (the equivalent in basketball to, say, punching the
referee in the face), then what we should do is *not* to mark the
distinction as a prohibited/not prohibited distinction as you suggest,
but rather to mark the distinction by the severity of the penalties
imposed (which is what they do in basketball: one-and-one for a
professional foul, ejection from the game and possible life suspension
for punching an umpire - but both actions are prohibited.)

Not being familiar with basketball, I could not say. If they were, as
you say, expressly prohibited, then I would expect players not to 
deliberately disobey, and I would be unhappy with them if they did. 
If they are accepted, as you say, as valid strategic moves, then I 
can only imagine that the players are playing by an unwritten code in
which these fouls are not expressly forbidden.

I would not oppose such a scheme, but you ought to know that I will
change my way of regarding my choice of actions. Any action that is not
expressly prohibited is fair game, as far as I am concerned. If I can
afford to pay the penalty (*) then I will have no compunction about
performing the Crime. If there are any actions we want to make complete
off limits (and I suspect there are) then I suggest that we still
expressly prohibit them.

Actually, in many cases, I would welcome such a scheme, as it would
give me more personal freedom as a Player, and provide more avenues
for interesting strategic play.

Blob

(*) Of course, I recognise that there are social and ethical considerations
to be taken into account, even if only in the role-playing sense, which
may make me more reluctant to commit certain Crimes. But at a meta-game
level, I would understand and approve of a player who strategically 
committed certain Crimes, as long as they were within the rules of the
game. This may happen even while I am condemning them at the role-playing
level. I would hope that other players might regard my Crimes in a 
similar light. :)

But they are expressly forbidden, it's just that they're penalizable.
Basketball doesn't make the distinction you recommend here, and I
think neither should we.

What, and not penalize them? It's too late for that. We've already
accepted the in principle possibility that Players are capable of
breaking the Rules if they choose to do so; the only logical thing
to do now, having accepted that possibility, is to go forward and
assign penalties appropriate to the various actions we want to
discourage. If there are actions that we want to make completely off-
limits (and I suspect there are), then we should penalize them with
permanent or very lengthy deregistration. Otherwise we end up in the
absurd situation of punishing least those actions, when they are
performed, which we most want to discourage.

I agree that this is the best (and only) argument for Crimes being
prohibited.  However, I do not recall that as being the way Crimes were
introduced to Agora - they were just a new toy, as it were, and were given
a somewhat suitable name.  Alas, that was so long ago that I cannot
remember what, if anything, was said about the issue.

For now, let me say that in this issue I basically agree with Blob and
disagree with Steve.

Yup. I agree. In RL, when you want to prohibit something, you make
it a crime, or an infraction, or a misdemeanor, or something of the
sort; you don't just say "Thou shalt not". I suppose at some point,
you start to omit the "Thou shalt not" altogether. Why should Agora
be different ?

The issue is more that not all things that are prohibited are morally
equivalent, nor is the deterrent provided for something that is
prohibited an adequate evaluation of the degree of 'wrongness' of
that action; it's just an indication of how strongly the law means to
seek to prevent people from doing it. For example, cruelty to animals
is punished less severely than tax evasion, but while I would not
want anything to do the former on moral grounds, I might well
consider the latter if I find taxes unfairly high.

Similarly, I would say that someone who 'breaks the Rules', by
committing a Crime or Infraction, is not necessarily guilty of
'spoiling the game' (the main issue, from a moral standpoint, with
Rule-breaking) to the same extent in each case, and that the Blot or
Currency punishment is not necessary indicative of the extent to
which such an action is, in terms of being a sociable Player,
unacceptable.

BUS: Kudo transfer

I haven't the time to look at it closely, but is it possible that Kudo

Herald to perform an action.  Is it possible that Scott has committed a crime
by making this transfer?

Actually, in real life there are a lot of "thou shalt nots" that are
neither crimes nor infractions.  They're called civil torts.  And,
oddly enough, you see people intentionally commit torts because the
potential gain to be obtained from the tortious act is greater than
the maximum penalty which can be imposed.  (Recent efforts toward
so-called "tort reform" have increased this tendency.)

I'd say not. The Rules platonically make the transfer happen upon a
valid KT request being posted, and the Herald adjusts eir records
accordingly. No obligation on the Herald is due solely to the KT
request itself.

However, since we now handle Currency transfers as imposing a
bookkeeping requirement on the Recordkeepor concerned and nothing
else, we might consider getting Kudo Transfers in line with them.

Dear Crito,

so far the MIME-mails you sent were just funny because of the wiseguy
remark your mailer puts at the head of each message. However, the
corrected Promotor's report was sent in some encoded form, so to me it

and so forth. I'd rather not change my mail reader just to access such
attachments - could you try to send unencoded plain text next time?

Thanks a lot.

I doubt it.  The Rules impose the requirement on the Herald, not me.

I think that could (or should) be said of any Order.  Anyone can issue and
order, but it is (or should be) the Rules which place the requirement on a
Player to actually obey the order.

In the current debate, this seems to me to be the most elegant solution for
fixing the Order Rules - restrict the requirement to obedience on explicit
statements within the Rules (which are already there for Currency and
"Judicial" orders) or to explicit statements within texts that have been given
that authority by the Rules.

Interesting points you raise. Of course, it remains true in RL that
the most socially unacceptable acts in general attract the harshest
penalties. What's the most socially unacceptable you can think of
in Agora? Pretending to be two Players at once? That's prohibited
by R1432, but it's not otherwise punishable.

I could see the file OK, but I can't reply to it as I usually can with

At any rate, I'm taking the above message to constitute the commencement

Because we are a game, and should not be limited by the weaknesses
of a society.

Of course, being a nomic, we have the option of exploring the weaknesses
of society, and are currently doing so.  But being limited to copying RL
forever is not a requirement of Agora.

Personally I think that any crime or immoral act committed for economic
gain ought to be punished more severely than the same severity of crime
committed for other reasons - simply because economic crime is
self-reenforcing, not entirely unlike a pyramid scheme. Unfortunately, the
examples you note are probably exceptions rather than the rule.  (Can you
tell that the recent event referenced in my signature has darkened my view
of humanity?)

I _like_ the feature of Agora that Rules are followed for their own sake
rather than because of any penalty.  The fact that certain other Players
seem to find this intrinsically illogical disturbs me.

I think an Officer willfully falsifying records would tend to get looked
at rather harshly.

I think the most unacceptable breach would be an intentional
violation of TIA. Multiple personalities would come second, closely
followed by willful violations of FOIA or Officer record transfers.

Well, the Rules don't place a requirement on the Player to obey it,
literally; they specify a penalty for no obeying it. Myself, I think 
that's tantamount to a requirement, but it's possibly not quite 
equivalent to it all the same.

Well, IRL you also expect people, on the whole, to abide by the law 
because of the law's sake - because of what it represents, a compact
between a commonality of persons who recognize that without rules
they couldn't live together. (Now that description wouldn't suit an
anarchist, which I once was...) And IRL also there are people who
find such a view illogical and are prepared to do anything for personal
gain as long as that gain outbalances the risk of penalty.

True.  This fits in with the discussion about Crimes and Rule breaking.  In
some cases the Rules could be written so that not obeying a certain kind of
Order could be breaking the Rules, but in other cases it could just be an
Infraction (or a Crime - I tend to agree with Blob's position, that a Crime is
just an Infraction with stiffer penalties unless the Rules explicitly prohibit
the criminal act).

Actually, insofar as I am an anarchist, I find the above statement
perfectly reasonable.  The point at where I diverge from the norm is
that I don't believe such a compact need come from a "State."  In any
group of people there is going to be an implicit set of rules about what
is acceptable and unacceptable, which ranges from cultural forces,
religion, and all the way to codified law.  My anarchist tendencies
simply tell me that, in RL, it is the codified law that should be the
least persuasive influence.

Of course, in Agora, my feelings are precisely the reverse :)

(Odd question this raises; How do people find their RL socio-political
views informing their play in Agora?  Is there a relation or not?)

possibly post the current text of any Orders you issued which were

That solution is not particularly elegant, IMO, and further guts the
use of Orders to enforce agreements or to provide restitution.  What

Well, you did if you thought that the grounds for the penalty was
Criminal activity. Scott asked for penalties simply on the grounds
that they were appropriate to the situation, for they would discourage
further such abuses.

No, of course we penalise them. I've said that already.

It does no such thing, as long as agreements are properly written down in a
form (such as SLCs) given proper authority by the Rules and as long as the
courts are authorized to order restitution or the forms of restitution are
clearly spelled out in the agreements.  IMO, all of the above is desireable in
any case.
