Will I survive as Speaker? Or will the Revolt succeed, and a spill of
all Official positions ensue? Over to you, Registrar Michael. Drumroll,
please.

<Speaker Steve prays for an 11 or higher on that 17-sided die.>

Interesting nit: if I were to Rebel now, R1664 is clear that I would
not increase the chances of the Revolt succeeding. But R1664 is not
clear that I would not enjoy the benefits of a successful Revolt, nor
suffer the penalties for an unsuccessful one.

Second nit: why doesn't R1664 say that in the event of a successful
Revolt, all Electees are retired from their Offices? As things stand,
Kolja will resume holding the Office of Ambassador when his Delegation
to Murphy expires, thus fortuitously avoiding the effect of the
Rebellion. I thought we'd fixed this bug when the concept of Electees
was introduced - that was, after all, the whole point, wasn't it?

This is true.  I don't think it's a serious bug, as you still don't
know what to do.

This is a definite bug.  The Electee notion fixed other problems, so
wasn't a pointless exercise, but this was definitely one of those
things that it should have fixed.  The relevant clause needs to be
rewritten to read
  "All Offices cease to have Electees; if an Electee holds an
   Office, then they are retired from that Office."
or something similar.

Michael.

well, i have cfj'd the method Michael used.  If he had used the entire
number, the revolt would have succeeded.  A method like that should be
announced before the numbers are available.  Its like saying "oh i need
a random number, wait, i rolled one last night, I will use that one."

Yes, but I said that I determined the method before checking the DJ
number.  Your CFJ effectively accuses me of lying, which is
unverifiable.  However, tradition has been to take people's word as
admissible evidence, so that if I say I did something one way, then
that will determine the judgement.  

Incidentally, I deliberately didn't use the whole number because I
know that the Dow uses a limited range of fractions for the fractional
value of stocks (up to 16ths or 8ths I believe), and this might have
compromised the distribution of the numbers.  (Given though that 17 is
prime perhaps this is not the case.)

Michael.

This is a poor choice of words given that I did in fact use the whole
part of the number.  I should have written the "entire number"
(meaning with the fractional part included), which is the phrase Lee
used.

This is a little like saying, if Michael had (through some other method)
rolled a 1, the revolt would have succeeded. And I believe that if one
happens to have a store of random numbers available, one should be
permitted to use a number from it; the issue is that a random selection
method needs to be 'random enough' to satisfy the legal requirement,
i.e. result in probabilities similar enough to those obtained by rolling
an N-sided die. (Knowledge of the random numbers in such a store,
and letting such knowledge affect the decision whether to use the 
store or another selection method, obviously negates randomness.)

However, I'm not quite certain Michael's method *is* random enough in
that sense. Fluctuations in a stock market index are subject to
non-random variations, for instance it's well known that some market
indices are 'physchological thresholds', when the Dow gets anywhere
close to 8000, 8500, 9000 market operators will tend to be more
conservative because a market index that decreases or increases too
fast could lead to a panic, and the 'round number' tends to work as
an attractor. Check the fluctuations of the Dow over a three-month
period, this doesn't look very random to me.

 http://chart.yahoo.com/c/3mm/_/_dji.gif

Of course it's possible that variation of the integral portion of the 
index modulo 17 is statistically random, but who's going to prove or
disprove it...

 Michael's method may be too close to the Cereal Box Standard. :)

The DJIA is the sum of the prices of 30 different stocks, multiplied
by some arcane factor to account for splits in the prices of those
stocks over the years.  While it's probably true that this favors
certain fractional values over others, I don't know what they would
be. :)

I cannot see any substantial fault in the randomization method
selected.

I'd feel more comfortable, possibly for no good reason, if you just used

Can anyone dig up the relevant CFJ? My records don't go back that far.

A little digging in the Archives, and voila!

Chuck seems to have anticipated all the possible objections in his very
thorough presentation of the Caller's Argument. My Judgement is little
more than a gloss.

In the present case, I think it's worth pointing out that R1079 states
that:

      It is up to common sense to determine what is reasonably close to
      equal; however, the burden of proof of a method's randomness lies
      with the Player who used the method.

Thus, the burden of proof lies with Michael to prove that using the DJIA
as he did is a random method.

Arguments of Caller (Chuck):

On June 30, Registrar KoJen announced that the Office of Notary
was vacant, and asked for volunteers.  On July 7, KoJen wrote:

Rule 790 states, in part: 
 
      [...] the Electioneer shall randomly 
      choose one player from those who indicated a willingness to hold 
      the Office, and that Player shall become that Officer.
 
Thus, if there is no random selection, then the office is not filled.
(Random is defined in Rule 1079.) 
 
I maintain that KoJen's selection is non-random. 
 
Rule 1079 demands that the probabilities be equal for a random 
selection.  No one expects the probabilities of a random selection 
to be perfectly equal (despite the fact that some Players have claimed 
that I do); this is unreasonable for any method of random selection. 
How large a tolerance is then reasonable?   IMO, for a choice between 
two random alternatives, 51-49 is just on the border of being 
reasonable, and 52-48 is clearly too large a bias. 
 
Now, is it likely that the ingredients on KoJen's cereal boxes give 
an equal distribution between even and odd ingredients? 
 
Possible: yes.  Likely: no.  Let's assume, for a moment, that 
the cereal boxes in a grocery store are equally distributed between 
even and odd numbers of ingredients.  (Even this is probably
invalid, but lets assume it for a moment.)  Does that mean that 
KoJen's cereals are evenly distributed between even and odd?  No.
 
KoJen, in all likelihood, does not buy every type of cereal in the 
store with equal frequency.  I can't speak for KoJen, but it seems 
likely that he buys, oh, 10 or so kinds of cereals regularly (with 
any others making a negligibly small amount).  Are these split 5 odd, 
5 even?  It's possible.  But it's also likely that they're split 
6-4 or 7-3.  In order to be reasonably certain that the cereals 
were biased no worse than 51-49, KoJen would have to buy on the 
order of 10,000 cereals! 
 
Objection 1.  "But it's equally likely that they're split 4 odd, 6 even 
or 4 even, 6 odd, so overall the probability is 50-50."  This would 
be true if KoJen bought a different 10 cereals every month.  But 
for the most part, he probably buys the same cereals.  Thus, the 
split is fixed at one value or the other. 
 
Objection 2.  "But we don't know which way the split goes, so 
it's still 50-50."  The fact that we don't know the probability of
KoJen picking an odd or even cereal does not magically make that 
probability 50-50.  Take, for example, the cereals in my apartment
at the time I wrote this.  3 of them have an odd number of ingredients, 
and 1 has an even number of ingredients.  Thus there is a 75-25 bias 
towards odd.  Now what would the case be if I had not gone and 
counted the ingredients on my cereals beforehand?  The probability 
would still be 75 odd, 25 even.  The fact that I didn't know what 
the probability was does not change the probability.  Likewise, 
it is likely that KoJen's selection is biased.  The fact that 
we do not know the bias does not change the fact that it *is* biased. 
 
Objection 3.  "The assignment of Swann to odd and Chuck to even was 
random."  No, this was an arbitrary assignment by KoJen.  He did 
not use any method of chance, but assigned them arbitrarily.   Is 
this random?  It may not be possible to predict in advance of KoJen's 
decision which will end up with which, but I maintain that the selection 
is not random.  It is impossible for the human brain, in and of itself, 
to make a truly random selection.   Digits that you pick out of thin 
air are not random.  If humans could pick randomly, we would not 
need to bother with any other random devices at all--how many
people would be willing to accept that? 

Objection 4.  "But since KoJen didn't know whether odd or even was 
more likely, he couldn't bias the outcome by assigning one player 
or the other to odd or even."  Correction: he couldn't *intentionally* 
bias the outcome.  No one is claiming he did.  But was his picking 
either (Swann odd, Chuck even) or (Swann even, Chuck odd) out of 
thin air truly random?  It was not, as we cannot make truly random 
decisions without some external random device. 
 
Objection 5.  "But weren't KoJen's assignments close to random?" 
I'm not saying there was a huge, 90-10 bias in KoJen's assignments. 
But it seems to me not unreasonable that there might be a 60-40 
bias. 
 
Objection 6.  "Don't the combined near-randomness of KoJen's 
assignments and the cereal boxes make the selection random?" 
They make it better, but still not close enough.  If KoJen's 
assignments were biased 60-40 (not an unreasonable assumption, 
IMO) and KoJen's cereal boxes were biased 60-40 (not an
unreasonable assumption, IMO), then the final selection is 
biased 52-48 (detailed explanation of this can be provided upon
request), an unacceptable deviation from 50-50. 
 
Thus, it is reasonably likely that KoJen's selection was nonrandom, 
and thus, the office of Notary has remained vacant. 
 
Objection 7: "You haven't proved that KoJen's selection was nonrandom; 
the burden of proof is on you."  I will grant that I cannot prove 
that KoJen's selection was nonrandom, but neither has anyone proven 
that the selection was random.  The assertion that the burden of 
proof lies on me is simply untrue.  In a CFJ, neither side 
has the burden of proof--the caller is not required to prove 
anything!  Rather, the burden is on the Judge to search out any 
relevant information not included in the CFJ and arrive at the 
correct conclusion emself, regardless of what the caller has 
or has not "proven."  If e is unable to gather information which 
is relevant to the truth of the CFJ, e must Judge UNKNOWN. 
(See Rule 591.)

============================================================

Arguments of Judge (Steve):

I am reluctant to deliver this Judgement, since I regard it as
desirable that there should be a clear cut answer to the question of
whether Swann is the Notary. However, careful consideration of
the facts and arguments presented have led me inexorably to the
conclusion that I am unable to obtain the information necessary
to determine the truth or falsity of the Statement. Hence I must,
by Rule 591, Judge UNKNOWN.

There seem to me to be two issues to consider: (i) was KoJen's
'coin' fair? That is, did KoJen's method of *selection* distribute
probability equally between its two possible outcomes? (ii) was
KoJen's *assignment* fair? That is, was his method of assigning
Chuck to even and Swann to odd a fair one? Now, if the answer to
*either* of these questions were 'yes', then that would suffice,
in my opinion, to prove the fairness of KoJen's method as a whole.
In that case, the Statement would be FALSE. To see this, consider
the following two extreme and opposite cases:

1. KoJen uses a completely biased method of selection, whose bias is
known to him prior to making the selection, eg, "if today's date is
even-numbered then Chuck is the Notary, otherwise Swann is the
Notary", when KoJen already knows what today's date is. However,
KoJen uses a completely fair method (such as flipping a fair coin) to
make the assignment of Chuck to even-numbered days and Swann to
odd-numbered days. 

2. KoJen uses a completely biased method to make the *assignment*,
but a completely fair method to make the selection.

I think it's clear that in both these cases, the method as a whole
is a fair one. Consider now the actual methods of assignment and 
selection employed by KoJen. His method of selection is by now
infamous - he looked at a cereal box he happened to have with him
to see if the number of ingredients listed on it was odd or even.
Less attention has been paid to his method of assignment, but it
appears that KoJen simply picked his assignment of Chuck to even
and Swann to odd out of his head. The question is: are either of 
these methods demonstrably fair, in the sense given above (which
is the sense of Rule 1079)? If either of them are demonstrably fair,
the Statement is FALSE.

But neither of the methods is demonstrably fair. Considering first
KoJen's method of selection, we should need to know much more about
which breakfast cereals KoJen buys, and about how the numbers of
ingredients listed on them are distributed among the even and odd
integers. (And why stop at breakfast cereals? Might not KoJen equally
have employed some other foodstuff that happened to be at hand? Even,
god forbid, a can of Nile Spice Black Bean Soup?) In the absence of
this information, we cannot know whether KoJen's 'coin' was fair.

Of course, all this would not matter if it could be demonstrated that
KoJen's *assignment* was fair. That's the point of the argument I
gave above. But was KoJen's assignment fair? Once again we seem to be
confronted with insurmountable epistemological obstacles. It is
apparently a part of widely accepted scientific wisdom that human
beings are not particularly reliable generators of random numbers,
(although I cannot cite specific scientific studies which confirm
this).  But what this implies for a given human being's ability to
choose randomly and fairly between two alternatives on a given
occasion is entirely unclear. It seems to me that we should need to
know a great deal not only about the neurophysiological mechanisms
which underpin the making of such choices generally, but also about
how they were operating in this specific instance. And once again,
this is information which it seems we cannot have. So we cannot know
that KoJen's assignment was fair, either.

So, given that we cannot definitively answer 'yes' to either of the
two questions above, the Statement cannot be FALSE. But it seems
to follow relatively straightforwardly that the Statement also cannot
be TRUE. For all we know, KoJen's method as a whole *might* have been
fair. It also might not have been. We should need to know a great deal
more than we do now - more, indeed, than we're ever likely to know - 
to determine whether or not it was. Since this crucial information
is unobtainable, I must Judge that the Statement is UNKNOWN.

Rule 591/2 (Mutable, MI=1) 
Legal Judgements 
 
      A legal Judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, UNDECIDABLE, or
      UNKNOWN.  The Judgement of UNDECIDABLE is reserved for those 
      statements which are logically neither TRUE nor FALSE.  The 
      Judgement of UNKNOWN is for those statements for which the 
      Judge is unable to obtain information necessary to determine 
      whether the statement is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE. 
 
      The Judge must make a reasonable effort to obtain all 
      information necessary to determine whether the statement 
      is TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDABLE. 
 
      The Judgement must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, 
      which include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of 
      deciding Rules, past Judgements, and game custom. A Judgement 
      delivered without reasons and/or arguments is completely 
      invalid. 
 
      Such reasons and arguments form no part of the Judgement itself. 
      However, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the reasons and 
      arguments along with the Judgement. 
 
      Any evidence which is used to justify the Judgement, other than 
      appeals to Game Custom or to common sense, must be presented by 
      the Judge.  If the Judge introduces evidence beyond that 
      submitted in the Call for Judgement, e must include this 
      evidence in eir Judgement.  All such added evidence must be 
      distributed as part of the reasons and arguments by the Clerk of 
      the Courts.

Volunteers for the Vacant Office of Notary were Chuck and Swann. 
 
I will now randomly choose the Notary. 
 
I have a cereal box in my lunch bag. It is "Raisin Squares". I will now
count 
the number of separate ingredients listed in the ingredients list. If it
is 
even, Chuck is the new Notary. If it is odd, Swann is. 
 
The number is 13. 
 
The new Notary is Swann.
