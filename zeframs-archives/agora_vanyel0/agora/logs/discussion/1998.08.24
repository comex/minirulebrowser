In such a case, even the attempt to avoid conflict by using the unless
construction fails, since each Rule insists on deferring to the other.
So effectively this is equivalent to a case of mutual deference clauses,
and lower Number will win.

Say A has the lower Number. Then in that case, I would say that Foo has
the value 6. This is contrary to those who have argued that if A wins
the conflict, then the value of Foo should be 5. It depends on what you
see the conflict as being about. I see it primarily as being about the
value of Foo, and only secondarily about who gets to defer. This
reflects my view of precedence/deference claims as second order
provisions for resolving conflicts between first order provisions. What
R1030 says is that second order provisions shall be used to resolve
conflicts, except where these conflict, in which case they shall be
ignored and a different method imposed by R1030 shall be used. So the
deference clauses get ignored and the orginal conflict about the value
of Foo gets resolved in A's favour.

Um. I think we must have gotten our wires crossed somewhere. My claim
was only this: that you never pinged me for FtR earlier than R1585 said
you ought to have done, even though that may have been your original
intention. By the time you noticed that Blob was not Speaker, a week had
passed, and you actions in reporting me were consistent with the view of
the precedence relations between R1585, R1686 and R1023 which I have
been elaborating.

I'm surprised that no-one has Appealed Blob's Judgement of CFJ 1100,
since he didn't consider the interesting issues arising in connection
with R478 that you, Scott and Morendil brought to my attention.

But in any case, the Judgement refers only to Private Transfer Orders,
not to Payment Orders.

So what if the example had been:

A: The value of Foo shall be 6, unless another Rule states otherwise, in
   which case this Rule makes no claim as to the value of Foo.

A: The value of Foo shall be 5, unless another Rule states otherwise, in
   which case this Rule makes no claim as to the value of Foo.

If anything counts as case of two Rules avoiding conflict by mutually
deferring, then this ought to be it. But I don't see it that way. I can
still see a clear division here between first and second order
provisions, so I think R1030 still steps in here, tells us to ignore the
second order provisions (since they conflict), and gives the lower
Numbered Rule (A, say) priority, in which case the value of Foo is 6.

I don't think that's right. Whether A claims precedence over B or B
claims to defer to A, both do so with the power and precedence of R1030,
if the Rules are of the same Power.

This invites the question, what if a Rule with same Power as R1030, ie
3, claimed precedence over R1030 in a conflict, say, over the question
of how a certain conflict between Rules of the same Power was to be
resolved? I doubt that the Rules as they presently are would have the
resources to settle such a dispute.

I don't think that's right. When R1030 states that if two Rules claim to
defer to each other, then the numerical method governs, I read this as
saying "the numerical method governs *instead of the deference
clauses*." Hence we should simply pretend that neither deference clause
exists, and resolve the conflict that remains over the value of Foo in
favour of A. So if A wins, Foo = 6.

I must admit that I did not read any of your n-d discussion of the 
issue, and based my judgement mostly on the arguments of the Justices.

What about the Annotation of R1585 I required you to make in CFJ 1061?

Blob specifically addressed my "equivalence" argument.  This was the
only thing I thought that stood in the way of sustaining the original
judgement.

In any case, the problem I have above is not with CFJ1100 but with
1103, which seems to suggest that my handling of Failure to Report for
new Officers has been incorrect.  How do we fix that?  

Michael.

Right.  I finally understand.  I was failing to realise that by
imposing a penalty on the 19th for failing to report, my doing so was
consistent with you having had a week in which to report, even though
I thought you'd only had a day or so.  Of course, if you had managed
to produce a report during the week of the 13th-19th, I would still
have pinged you for failing to report before the 12th.

But this view of provisions in rules having different status (first
order vs second order) is not supported by anything in the ruleset.
It seems more likely to me that as far as the ruleset is concerned,
rules should be read in their entirety.  In particular, I don't see
why you assume conflict detection happens before a rule is read
fully.  

You would presumably agree that the two following rules do not
currently conflict:

A1: The value of Foo shall be 6.  However, if the current President of
    the United States of America is Bill Clinton, then the value of
    Foo shall be 5.

B1: The value of Foo shall be 5. 

So, it's OK for A to have conditional statements in it that over-rule
previous statements, as long as they don't look like:

"If another rule specifies ..."

Your take on conflict would surely lead you to conclude that the
following rules do in fact conflict:

A2: The value of Foo shall be 6.  However, if another rule attempts to
    specify a value for Foo, then the value of Foo shall be 5.

B2: The value of Foo shall be 5.

These conflict by your reasoning, and if A had higher power than B,
the value of Foo would be 6.  I just don't believe this.  Somehow the
second sentence of A2 is "second order" and thus not able to govern in
the same way as the second sentence of A1. 

Michael.

I think here is where I have a slight disagreement with Steve, although I
haven't had the time to think through the consequences carefully enough yet.  I
post the thought anyway, in hopes that it might help others with more time on
their hands to clarify things.

I don't think the Rules require 1030 to claim precedence or to defer to other
Rules.  This ability is intrinsic in a Rules capacity to be effective.  R1030
makes this ability specific and clarifies how such claims of precedence and
deference should be resolved to avoid paradox.

I was hoping it would pass, too. Unfortunately, several Players who said
they would support it failed to vote on it.

Do you have the last Scorekeepor's Report? Nevermind, I'll send it.

It's tempting, I agree, to view a Rule's ability to take precedence over
another Rule as instrinsic to the Rule itself, and independent of R1030.
But is that really so? In general, we recognise the right of Rules to
modify the meanings of words in other Rules, without conflict, and
within reasonable limits. So it seems that in general, the meaning of a
Rule is always at least potentially an extrinsic, not intrinsic, matter.
R1030 might, after all, have said "If at least one of the Rules in
conflict claims to take precedence over, or to defer to, the others,
then such claims shall be ignored and the Rulekeepor shall choose at
random one of the Rules in conflict to take precedence over the others."
I don't think that one could say in case like that a Rule's ability to
take precedence over another Rule was an intrinsic ability of the Rule
itself. And I don't think the present situation is so far removed from
my hypothetical case. R1030 modifies the way precedence/deference claims
are understood in Rules, and it does so with its own Power and
effectiveness.

I don't accept that the second sentence of A2 in the example above is a
second order provision. I think it's a rather confused first order
provision. Its first half looks like a conflict-avoiding provision
("However, if another Rule says otherwise..."), but then it turns around
and becomes yet another (potentially) conflict-creating provision
("...the value of Foo shall be 5."). What it isn't is a conflict-
*resolving* provision, which is what it would have to be to qualify as a
second-order provision. So, in fact, I don't think that the above Rules
actually conflict after all, although it's an interesting question which
Rule is responsible for setting the value of Foo.

To answer that question, change B2 into B3:

B3: The value of Foo shall be 4.

Now I agree that A2 and B3 conflict. A2 says that Foo=5, while B3 says
that Foo=4. But there are no second order provisions here to resolve the
conflict, and once again, if the Rules are of equal Power, R1030 will
have to step in to resolve the conflict.
