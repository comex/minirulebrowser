I prefer the more formal framework.  At the very least, it serves
as a reminder that there's another way to play subgames rather than
just writing them directly into the Rules.

Not as you define it here, no, but I think the distinction is a
natural one.  It's a bit easier to imagine in a FTF nomic--they
might have a bunch of blue, red, and white poker chips, each of
which is defined by the Rules to be either Green or Purple.  But
this wouldn't be allowed under your system, or at least the
Greenness/Purpleness wouldn't be called a Nomic Property (which
it seems to me that it should be).

Well, as long as hell is purely immaterial, then it can be
regulated by your nomic. :)

True, their are potential pitfalls in both methods.  I'm not sure
which one I'm more worried about yet.  Although in your case I
would probably say that, knowing eir budget cannot be changed,
the candidate should take potential competitor's budgets into account when
setting eir own.

Agreed; I intend to make the sum of the maximum salaries roughly
equal to the current total BOSs being paid out in salaries and
unemployment.

Well, let's see.  1) I currently hold an office in perpetuity.  2) In
its simplest form (which I intend to hold to, at least for the initial
implementation), salaries change only at elections.

Yes, you can be sure that initial salaries will be specified. :)

So a message sent both to a-d and a-b is not sent to a public forum?

True, but our numbers don't seem to vary that much over time.  If there
are drastic increases in the number of players, I would think that
could be handled on a case-by-case basis by changing the maximum
salaries.  Perhaps this could be facilitated by specifying all the
maximum salaries in a single rule, rather than having each one in
the defining rule for each office.

But then you lose some of the incentive to vote for the candidate
with the lower budget.

Considering rule 116

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

As there is no rule concerning the ROM then it's existance is 
unregulated.  However, the ROM would try to change the rules, which is 
not allowed due to rule 116 as the rule concerining it rule changing 
ability no longer exists.

However, surely it is impossible to tell who the exicutor of an 
unregulated entity is.  As it is not defined in the rules there is no 
regulation of who the exicutor of a non-existant entity could be.  So 
anybody or everybody could claim to be the exicutor of a non-existant 
entity. But they would have no power under the rules to change the 
rules.  (I hope this is right and there's nothing I missed out)

Have a nice day....

Couldn't there be some sort of blind sumbmission, with all of the bugets 
posted to and address?  Then all of the are released to a public forum 
at the same time.  This process could be repeated 2 or 3 times if 
needed.

But Officer Elections don't all happen at the same time.

I, on the other hand, am having second thoughts, prompted by the thought
that Repeal-O-Matic is in Probate. If it's in Probate, then it probably
still exists, and Scott could in theory be guilty of Impersonating it.
There's even a kind of logic to this. Scott is not the Executor of the
ROM while it's in Probate (who is? the Notary?), and so attempting to
transfer P-Notes from it is confusing for the P-Note Recordkeepor. It's
precisely to discourage such attempts that Scott wrote the Rule (1630)
which makes Impersonation a Crime.

I think two points could be made: firstly, R116 probably should be read
as relating more to actions that questions of existence; secondly, it
would appear that the existence of the ROM is not, after all,
unregulated, despite its repeal. The Probate Rules still apply to it.

It may be in the interest of the Voting Public to know that you are 
wrong there. Both proposals in that batch passed. A Duty to Propose
is gone, and a Duty to Vote takes its place. What elegant symmetry. :)

A proper Assessor's Report will follow ASAP.

Necessarily, an entity in Probate has no Executor; having no Executor
is a prerequisite for being in Probate.

Neither the Notary nor the ROM's Trustee is the ROM's Executor.  The ROM's
Trustee is allowed to do certain things as if e were Executor (R1738, R1739,
and R1757) but that's different.

I assume that a given entity has no Executor unless the Rules define it as
having one, and thus that the ROM currently has no Executor.

Consider a R1575 defense of Scott.  Clearly, at the time in question, Scott
believed that the ROM had not yet been repealed, and thus that it was not
Impersonation for em to act on its behalf.  It is likely that e had received
a report of its repeal, but not yet read it.  Is his belief reasonable?

Those are the main changes, but they make all the difference. The main
problem with past point systems is that they were (1) uncompetitive,
(2) gave out points for too limited a range of actions. Most of the
time when I was playing, I'd have 15 Points or so while the leaders
would quickly amass 75-100, and there'd be no way to catch up at my
usual amount of playing. Under my system, I'll be competing with
the other Players who have 15 Points or so. I wouldn't be surprised
if 25 Points wins the lowest Circle. I'm much more likely to act
positively to gain 10 Points than I am to gain 80 or so. Also, in
the past, Proposing was the main way to actively gain Points. Those
Players who didn't Propose much didn't have much opportunity to feel
active about their scoring. I've tried to remedy that.
  Sure, Teams are optional, but I'm more likely to join a team if
I know my participation counts. Requiring one player to come from
each Circle prevents teams from loading up on the "best" Players.
  In the past, too, we tried to turn Points into a kind of economy, 
with trading, which it seems to me interfered with the competitive
aspect also.
   Players have complained (or at least observed), that there are far
fewer classic Scams then there used to be. Swann's dissertation on the
Mousetrap Scam suggested that Players are unwilling to let Scams go
forward. I submit that the main change is that most (though not all)
of the earlier Scams were attempts to win by amassing Points (in fact,
virtually every scam of note apart from the Mousetrap Scam). I feel
that Players are more likely to look kindly on scams that attempt to
win (which, after all, under my system only gets one the SPT 'trophy'
for three months) than a scam like the Mousetrap.
   There have been recent attempts to increase interaction between
players, mostly cooperatively. I think there needs to be a competitive
counterbalance. Sure, some Players won't care. But there's no work for
them if they don't. And if Agora is a game, shouldn't we have winners
and losers?

Then participation would be optional. My plan (hee hee hee) is
that Players, when placed in a competitive environment (unlike
earlier days, when there was little competition), will become
more competitive. After all, _everything_ can be done as a contest
rather than through the Rules.

Well, you could have just used "rational numbers" if you wanted to avoid
real numbers.  But I don't see what the fuss is about this one.  There is no
particular reason to make the bar number a multiple of the MUQ since it's
just a reference point around which priorities take on different legal
significance.  It doesn't matter whether a Proposal can take on a priority
*exactly* equal to the bar.

But I am not raising a defense under Rule 1575.  That's an affirmative
defense; what I am doing is attacking the sufficiency of the evidence
in support of elements of the offense -- which, I might add, all of
which must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  I am arguing that Rule
1630 does not apply at all.  Rule 1630 requires that the offender
_knowingly_ attempt to act as or purport to be the Executor of an
entity of which e is not the Executor.  There is no requirement in
Rule 1630 that such knowledge be reasonable.

The real question here is, what is the scope of the term "knowingly"
in Rule 1630?  Does it reach merely to knowingly attempting to act as
an Executor, or does it also reach to knowing that the actor is not
the Executor of the entity in question?  I argue that it needs to be
the latter.  The purpose of this Criminal Rule is to penalize people who
try to deliberately confuse other Players by pretending to be the
Executor of an entity of which they are not.  The term "knowingly" is
intended to exclude from the scope of the Rule those cases where
someone accidentially does so.

Need I point out that I got an A- in Criminal Law? :)

Actually everything can be done using 1742. I hereby protopropose
the following Proposal:

Not a Proposal:

1742 is all we need (almost)

All Rules are hereby repealed except 1742.

The Repeal-O-Matic never had any ability to change the Rules.  That

Um.  Rule 1478: "Any other entity [i.e. not a Player] has an Executor
only when the Rules specify either a Player or a means to designate a
Player to be the Executor of that entity."

My concern is in ensuring that, as Promotor, I don't have to worry
about a Proposal getting a priority that I cannot easily represent as
a string of digits.  Irrational numbers are problematic in this regard
(I recall that we once had a Proposal with an AI of the square root of
3, for example; thankfully, it failed) and even rational numbers
create problems because there is no terminating representation for
most of them.  Keep in mind that most Officers rely to a greater or
lesser degree on computerized assistance; it is unwise to implement

Just a thought.  I wonder if it would be better to operate this defense based
on a concept of "reasonable error" rather than (or in addition to) "reasonable
belief".  A mistaken belief may not be a "reasonable belief" in the strict
sense that people seem to be trying to apply.  But there could certainly be
reasonable explanations for making errors.

A reasonable concern.  But maybe I missed something, because I thought
the only way a Proposal could change priorities would be by the payment
of P-Notes.  This would necessarily constrain priorities to a multiple of
the P-Note MUQ, no matter what the value of the bar was, as set by
the Promotor.

I argue that grammar demands the former.  Try as I might, I
cnnot manage to parse it such that "knowingly" also applies
to "of which e is not the Executor."

Its intent is irrelevant.

Never assume that the only ways that you can think of for a thing to
happen are the only ways in which it can _actually_ happen.  Put
another way, better safe than sorry.

To "knowingly" act means that the act was performed with knowledge,
and grammar alone does not (and cannot) answer the question of what
that knowledge was.  Note that an adverb cannot grammatically bind to
a noun or noun phrase; adverbs bind to verbs or adjectives.  The only
valid grammatical target here is "act", which is the main verb of the
sentence.  This brings us back to the question of what knowledge is
required in the act to comprise the offense, without shedding any
useful light on it at all.  So much for grammatical deconstruction.

Charles> Its intent is irrelevant.

I don't think that this saw is pertinent any more in Agoran
jurisprudence, if it ever was.  In any case, what do you propose we
use instead to resolve an ambiguous construction?  Tea leaves?

It covered, in large part, the sort of statutory deconstruction that
we are doing right now.  Many of the same principles apply broadly to
any legal system using surpreme written rules (at least in English).
If anything, my experience in Agora aided my performance in criminal
law. :)

Quite correct--it cannot apply to the "is" in "for which e is
not the Executor."  To have the interpretation you desire, it
would have to be phrased something like "knowingly attempt to
act as the Executor of an Entity for which e knows e is not
the Executor."

I have no problem using intent to resolve an ambiguous construction.
I do not believe this construction is ambiguous, however.

Protoproposal Chaos78 [rev. 1]

Summary Adoption

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

The Proposer of any Proposal may cause it to be Adopted Without
Objection, but only if the Proposal has not yet been distributed.

A Proposal Adopted Without Objection is Adopted at the time its
Proposer changes its status to Adopted in accordance with the
procedure for performing changes Without Objection, but only if at
that time that Proposal has not yet been distributed.

When a Proposal is Adopted Without Objection, it is removed from the
Queue.

This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent a
Proposal from being Adopted Without Objection, and over any Rule which
would prevent a Proposal Adopted Without Objection from being removed
from the Proposal Queue.

So Chuck wants to interpret it as "(knowingly act as the Executor) of
an entity of which e is not the Executor", and Scott wants
knowingly (act as the Executor of an entity of which e is not the
Executor)". I think both interpretations are possible.

The Rule will have to have Power=3 in order to take precedence over
R955, which it conflicts with.

That was my first impulse as well.  But Scott emself points
out that "knowingly" must modify "act" and cannot possibly
be read to modify "is".

I have decided to implement Chuck's suggestion to make the
Grand Agoran Tournament into a Contest, but I have a question:
can my Contest hand out Scoring Patent Titles? The PT Rule
says:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent
      Titles can be possessed only by persons.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such events of which the Rules state that they
      have no Historical Significance.  This list is known as the Gold
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

Now it doesn't place any restrictions on who can award Patent
Titles. So the only possibly relevant Rule is 1011:

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

Now is "possessing a Scoring Patent Title" a property? I'd say so. But
is it a Nomic Property? Since it is a kind of Patent Title, the
initial reaction is to say yes. However, anyone possessing the
property of having a SPT will do so because of the Rules defining
Patent Titles AND the Regulation defining when and how they are handed
out and not "_solely_ by the virtue of the Rules defining that
Property"  Anyone agree with this reasoning?

But one can (and probably should) read the is as not a seperate verb
but as part of an adverbial clause modifying "act". It is like a
law making it illegal to "knowingly give false testimony." Surely
you wouldn't have that as it reads apply to testimony that the witness
didn't know was false, since the witness knew it was testimony? Okay,
here "false testimony" is a direct object and not an adverb, but
what about a law making it illegal to "knowingly speak in an insulting
manner"?

No, "of which e is not the Executor" is an adjectival clause
modifying "Entity."

Okay, here is the breakdown:
(knowingly) (act as Executor of) (an Entity of which ....)
  adverb	verb		 	direct object
(knowingly) (give)               (false testimony)
  adverb	verb			direct object

How are these cases different?

Yes, you are of course correct.

But that isn't what I'm suggesting it is doing.  I'm suggesting that
the knowledge that is part of the act is knowledge of the attendant
circumstance described in the subordinate clause.  You are suggesting
that it does not.  I argue that grammatical deconstruction cannot
resolve this question.

I don't really have any long-term goals at the moment.  I'm suggesting 
this idea merely because it streamlines making minor, uncontroversial
changes to the Rules, such as spelling corrections or formatting
adjustments.

However, this does not solve the problem one little bit. In both
interpretations knowingly modifies "act".

I get a deja-vu feeling. This is practically the same problem as with my
Transfer-Order-that-was-meant-to-be-a-Payment-Order with respect to Rule
1575. Although in that case there was also Steve's (I think it was him)
objection based on the word 'reasonable'. But the difference in
interpretation that Oerjan and I were talking about is in fact the same
one as the one that is under discussion here.

Probably.

I should note that the existence of this ambiguity (which Chuck denies 
exists, but which I believe most of the rest of us see) is implicitly
acknowledged by most real-life criminal code.  For example, Model
Penal Code  2.02(4):

    (4) Prescribed Culpability Requirement Applies to All Material 
  Elements.  When the law defining an offense prescribes the kind of
  culpability that is sufficient for the commission of the offense,
  without distinguishing among the material elements therefore, such
  provision shall apply to all the material elements of the offense,
  unless a contrary purpose plainly appears.

Contrast Indiana's approach; Indiana Code 35-41-2-2 requires:

  Sec. 2 (d) Unless the statutes defining the offense provides
  otherwise, if a kind of culpability is required for commission of an 
  offense, it is required with respect to every material element of
  the prohibited conduct.

Indiana's statute does not reach to attendant circumstances; the Model 
Penal Code does.

Agora has no comparable Rule to either of the foregoing statutes, nor
does it have any applicable case law.  The question of the proper
scope of terms of culpability is unanswered by the Rules, by Game
Custom, and by prior Judgements.  That leaves us with the best
interests of the Game, and other standards.

I'm not sure I follow.  Are you saying that what knowledge must
be involved cannot be determined at all by the grammar, but only
by the intent?  Would you say that the fact that the knowledge
involved does not include the knowledge that Paris is the capital
of France is not determined by the grammar alone?

Probably because contests have to charge an entry fee in order
to give out prizes, while Rules-based subgames can magically
pay out currencies to themselves.  I don't particularly believe
this subsidization is a good thing.

Actually, it *cannot* be determined by grammar alone.  It is determined
by syntax.

BTW, I don't think "as Executor" is a direct object. I think "as Executor of..."
is an adverbial clause modifying "act".  These descents into the depths of English
grammar are giving me a case of the bends.  I wonder how our non-native
English speakers are holding up? 8)

Something like that occurred to me, but that's a level of complexity I'd
prefer not to add.

On the other hand, Vlad makes a good point, in that the competitive
spirit of Agora seems to have flagged somewhat in recent years, and a
mandatory competition (even if for essentially meaningless prizes)
might liven things up a bit.

I am concerned about certain aspects of Vlad's proposal (specifically, 
I noted that it does something with the Proposal Queue in certain
circumstances, which may fall within the scope of unduly burdening
other Officers), but I welcome the injection of his fresh ideas.
