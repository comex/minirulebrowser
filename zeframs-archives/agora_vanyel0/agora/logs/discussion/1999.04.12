I note that this will not take effect until the beginning of next week,
vis:

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,
          in which case the new value takes effect at the beginning of
          the Nomic Week following the next Nomic Week.

(Ulch, did I write that?)

H. Promotor pro-tempore Blob,

I hereby pay 0.1 P-Notes to the Bank to raise the Priority of this

Indeed, that is also what my records show. So, I hereby amend the POs

My apologies to Crito for stuffing his records around like this. I must've 
had my brain in neutral.

Actually, I don't think he actually rebelled. To quote from his Writ of
FAGE:

> Finally, I hereby call for a Rebellion

Which I think can be considered the same thing as "Calling for Revolt"
as defined by Rule 1664. Even so, I don't think it is successful, because
the player calling for Revolt has to be Rebellious at the time, which I
can find no evidence to show he was. Which is just as well, as the 
probability of success would be very small, and it would most likely 
only serve to give some Blots to Morendil, who hardly deserves it.

Woop! Woop! Woop!

This is a test of the Agoran Emergency Scam Warning System. This is only
a test. If there were a real Scam in progress, you'd already be fleeced.

Thankyou.
