I think Swann didn't vote on it because he was denied Voting Privileges.
I didn't vote on it because I thought it was a bad Proposal.

Proto-Proposal
Tweak R1567

[Comment: Kolja's Judgement of CFJ 1101 having been upheld, here's a
proto to amend R157 so that it does what we'd like it to do.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1567 be amended by replacing the text in it
which currently reads:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific CFJ
      by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts, specifying
      the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

with text which reads:

      A Player may make emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible. 

      A Player may make emself ineligible to Judge any CFJ called during
      a period of time by notifying the Clerk of the period of time
      during which e wishes to be ineligible to Judge. The notification
      must indicate when the period is to commence (the period may not
      commence earlier than the time of the notification), and when the
      period is to conclude. The time of conclusion may be vaguely
      indicated; hence, "As of this message, I hereby make myself
      ineligible to Judge any CFJ called until I notify the Clerk
      otherwise." is permitted, and has its intended effects.

Can I take you up on one of the offers but not the other?
P3783 is Blob's problem as far as I'm concerned. But I'll happily
pay you 0.8 VTs to vote for P3784.

Proto-Proposal
Tweak R1567

[Comment: Kolja's Judgement of CFJ 1101 having been upheld, here's a
proto to amend R157 so that it does what we'd like it to do.]

[v1.1: clarified slightly the ways in which the time of conclusion of
the period of ineligibility may be vague.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1567 be amended by replacing the text in it
which currently reads:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific CFJ
      by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts, specifying
      the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

with text which reads:

      A Player may make emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible. 

      A Player may make emself ineligible to Judge any CFJ called during
      a period of time by notifying the Clerk of the period of time
      during which e wishes to be ineligible to Judge. The notification
      must indicate when the period is to commence (the period may not
      commence earlier than the time of the notification), and when the
      period is to conclude. The time of conclusion may be vaguely
      indicated, as long as it will be clear to the Clerk, when that
      time comes; hence, "As of this message, I hereby make myself
      ineligible to Judge any CFJ called until I notify the Clerk
      otherwise." is permitted, and has its intended effects.
