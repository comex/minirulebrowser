In the interests of furthering debate, I post the following
protoproposal, and put on my flame-retardant undies.

Vlad

Protoproposal: Descartes A La Carte

Amend 1011 by replacing the current text with the following:

1) All Entities are either Material (i.e. they are measurable, physical
objects) or Immaterial (i.e. they are not).

2) Material Entities may have Immaterial representations (e.g. thoughts),
and Immaterial Entities may have Material representations (e.g. scores on
a piece of paper), but an Entity is is no way to be equated with its
representation.

3) No Material Entity may alter or affect any Immaterial Entity, and vice
versa.

4) The Rules, being Immaterial Entities, may regulate other Immaterial
Entities (specifically, those created by the players), but not Material
ones (including Material representations of Immaterial Entities).

5) Any Immaterial Entity regulated by the Rules is a Nomic Entity, and any
property of an Immaterial Entity regulated by the Rules is a Nomic
Property. Only the Rules may regulate Nomic Entities and Nomic Properties.

6) Players, being people, are an exception to (1) and (3) in that they
have both Material and Immaterial components, which may affect one
another. Therefore, the Rules may affect Material Entities by requiring a
Player's Immaterial component to make its Material component perform
certain actions. 

7) Only Entities with free will have the ability create, alter, or
regulate Immaterial Entities. People have free will. 

8) Since people have free will, the Rules may only affect a person's
Immaterial component with his or her consent.

9) Players with philosophical objections to this Rule are enjoined to
treat it as a legal fiction.

Seems to me it would be useful to allow material entities to have
immaterial properties (e.g., whether a Player is abiding or rebellious)
which could be regulated by the Rules.

Hmm...might it not be simpler to define people as purely Material,
and make them exceptions to (3) and (4) instead?

Another interesting possibility is that if you were playing in a nomic
where the avatar paradigm was in operation (or could convert a nomic
to the avatar paradigm), you could treat players as purely immaterial
without any problem.

Do the Rules have free will?  Can people change Immaterial Entities
regardless of the Rules?  Does this provision even need to be in here?

Or are you suggesting that Immaterial Entities are not directly
altered by the Rules, but by people's manipulations of them,
as required by the Rules?  If so, just how are the entities altered?
When the responsible person *thinks* that they are altered?  It can't
be when the change is recorded, because, as you will recall,
Immaterial Entities are not to be confused with their Material
representations!

Well, gee, that's nice to have in there.  Otherwise (if you interpret
a person's immaterial component as eir soul) the Rules would be
empowered to condemn a soul to hell.  They still are, as long
as the person consents.  Hey, now you can sell your soul to Agora!
(Some players will no doubt maintain they have already done this :)

Legal fiction, indeed.  When I read things like this I come to
appreciate the view that all Rule-defined entities/properties are
legal fictions.

Well, Players are partly Immaterial, see below. Anyway, you are
confusing properties with entities. Properties are neither material
nor immaterial.

Then it wouldn't be dualistic! I like the idea of people being a sort
of Material-Immaterial conduit, and making them a bit of both is a
nice way to do that. Not corresponding to reality, as you note, but
elegant. This is a game, after all.

Sure, there are lots of possibilities. I'm not claiming superiority, 
just that I have never seen it attempted from this point of view before.

That was what I was suggesting. To suggest that the Rules have the
power to alter the Immaterial on their own leads to the sort
of anti-pragmatic game state that the General has been working against.
And yes, it can be when the change is recorded, if we are giving
legal significance to the material representations and not the
Immaterial entities (the Pragmatic/Platonic divide I just mentioned). I
admit trying to have my cake and eat it too. The usefulness of this
formulation is, it works equally well whether you want a Platonic
game or a Pragmatic one. In the latter, Material representations have
final legal significance, in the former, the Immaterial Entities
themselves do.

If there is a hell. My Proto is silent on that issue :-)

I am a staunch Materialist myself, in RL. But the dualistic point of
view does help in certain situations, similar to treating gas molecules
as having zero size. I know nothing like this could ever pass, but
it is interesting to try and define fundamental game terms in the form of 
a set of philosophical principles.

OK, I should be in bed now, but I just had this great germ of an
idea which I wanted to throw out for discussion.  If it's well-received
I'll try to write up a proto this weekend.

The central notion is that in an Election for Office, each candidate
can set what eir salary will be if e wins the election.

More specifically: (but still very general and even vague in parts :)

Each Office, rather than having a set salary, has a maximum
salary, somehwat larger than the current salaries.
If an Office currently had a salary of 1.5BOS, its maximum salary
might be 2.0 or 2.5 or 3.0BOS.  I'd want to set the numbers so
the initial conditions were roughly equal to the current conditions.
(Also, throughout this procedure, all numbers are expressed as
multiples of the BOS, so the Chancellor retains that control
over the economy).

When an Election is held, each candidate sets a budget, not
to exceed the maximum salary.  The voting is held, as now,
with full knowledge of what each candidate's budget is.  
Budgets do not affect election results, except inasmuch as
they may influence people's votes.

The winning candidate's budget then becomes the salary for that
office until the next election is held.  Here's the clever bit:
you take a conical ebony tub and fill it with white sand....no,
that's something else. :)  The clever bit is that each week,
for each office, the difference between the maximum salary
and the actual salary is divided among all Players.  This
takes the place of unemployment.  Thus, Players have
an incentive to vote for the candidate with the lower budget--on
the other hand, if a candidate has a proven record of doing eir
job well, the electorate might be willing to pay em more than
another, unproven candidate.  (It might make a bit more sense to
divide the excess between all Players except the Officer, but
including em makes the calculations much easier--the Registrar
can pool the excesses from all Offices and then divide them).
I'm debating whether to give a larger share of the excess
to unemployed players than to officers--I'll have to look
at some scenarios.  One advantage, though, to giving everyone
an equal share of the excess is that holding office then always
pays better than being unemployed, unless you set a 0BOS budget.

Another effect would be that if there was only one candidate for
an office, e could command the maximum salary.  To limit
this, I'd probably require nominations to be public, as well
as budgets--made at the time of nomination and not changeable.
(This avoids a candidate setting a very reasonable budget to
dissuade competitors, then switching to the maximum at the last
minute.)  Of course, if no one has nominated very near the end
of the nomination period, a single candidate may still be able to
command the maximum salary, but if the Office is so undesirable,
then perhaps e should be getting such a large salary!

Ultimately, I would hope that this would lead to more contentious
elections and to self-regulating Officer salaries.

Comments?

Hsm... but then you have the problem that one candidate sets a reasonable
budget, maybe a bit high, and a second candidate comes in and undercuts
em. If e cannot change eir Budget, then e has no means to respond.
Better, imho, to leave the Budgets unregulated, at least for starters,
and see what kind of bidding behavior arises, before trying to counteract
it.

That aside, I like the idea. 

A second possibility: Allow the Registrar to issue a Budget for all
Officer's salaries, as part of eir election. Maybe not quite as exciting,
but worth considering. It would certainly add some interesting political 
clout to that Office, which is otherwise a bit unexciting.

What is "sound discretion"?

I think I'd still like to see a hard limit of one week imposed on
actions to be performed in a timely manner. Otherwise, despite the hard
conceptual work I did designing R1023, I like your amendment.

Would it not make more sense to have a provision for Amnesty provided by
Proposal rather than Rule?

Seems like I beat you to it by 25 minutes... Or do TOs have to go through

That's not enough, I think. I can well imagine a situation in which a
Player might try deliberately sending such a message with the intent of
deceiving other Players into thinking that e had voted.

I tend to think that the Repeal-O-Matic, being an entity having no
existence apart from that given to it by the Rules, ceased to exist when
the Rule which brought it into existence was repealed. I also think that
one cannot be guilty of Impersonating a non-existent entity.

But the Player remains an Agora entity, at least until probate clears.  Or 
does the Repeal-O-Matic go through probate?  I haven't looked at that 
section of the Rules for a long time.

I really like this idea. Just make it as straightforward as possible;
it will lead to a lot of additional bookkeeping even in its simplest
form. For example, just divide money not used for salaries between all
players. And don#t increase the salaries too much - all the VTs that
are available as salaries _will_ be paid out to someone, so if you
double the salaries ceilings, you double the overall number of VTs
that are brought into circulation and create inflation.

OK, I should be in bed now, but I just had this great germ of an
idea which I wanted to throw out for discussion.  If it's well-received
I'll try to write up a proto this weekend.

The central notion is that in an Election for Office, each candidate
can set what eir salary will be if e wins the election.

More specifically: (but still very general and even vague in parts :)

Each Office, rather than having a set salary, has a maximum
salary, somehwat larger than the current salaries.
If an Office currently had a salary of 1.5BOS, its maximum salary
might be 2.0 or 2.5 or 3.0BOS.  I'd want to set the numbers so
the initial conditions were roughly equal to the current conditions.
(Also, throughout this procedure, all numbers are expressed as
multiples of the BOS, so the Chancellor retains that control
over the economy).

When an Election is held, each candidate sets a budget, not
to exceed the maximum salary.  The voting is held, as now,
with full knowledge of what each candidate's budget is.  
Budgets do not affect election results, except inasmuch as
they may influence people's votes.

The winning candidate's budget then becomes the salary for that
office until the next election is held.  Here's the clever bit:
you take a conical ebony tub and fill it with white sand....no,
that's something else. :)  The clever bit is that each week,
for each office, the difference between the maximum salary
and the actual salary is divided among all Players.  This
takes the place of unemployment.  Thus, Players have
an incentive to vote for the candidate with the lower budget--on
the other hand, if a candidate has a proven record of doing eir
job well, the electorate might be willing to pay em more than
another, unproven candidate.  (It might make a bit more sense to
divide the excess between all Players except the Officer, but
including em makes the calculations much easier--the Registrar
can pool the excesses from all Offices and then divide them).
I'm debating whether to give a larger share of the excess
to unemployed players than to officers--I'll have to look
at some scenarios.  One advantage, though, to giving everyone
an equal share of the excess is that holding office then always
pays better than being unemployed, unless you set a 0BOS budget.

Another effect would be that if there was only one candidate for
an office, e could command the maximum salary.  To limit
this, I'd probably require nominations to be public, as well
as budgets--made at the time of nomination and not changeable.
(This avoids a candidate setting a very reasonable budget to
dissuade competitors, then switching to the maximum at the last
minute.)  Of course, if no one has nominated very near the end
of the nomination period, a single candidate may still be able to
command the maximum salary, but if the Office is so undesirable,
then perhaps e should be getting such a large salary!

Ultimately, I would hope that this would lead to more contentious
elections and to self-regulating Officer salaries.

Comments?

Oi!  Definitely time for "Read the Ruleset Week" .  I thought the TO just

The software I use to do official business only presents to me
messages that were to the Public Fora; hence, if it's not in the
Public Forum I won't process it.  I read mail separately from
processing official business (in fact, I often delete mail containing
only official business unless I feel a need to comment on it) so I
might not notice something sent only to the discussion group.  The
discussion group and the Public Forum are lumped together into one
mail folder for my reading convenience.

In short, agora-discussion should not be considered a reliable means
of sending messages of any sort to the Promotor.  Either use a Public
Forum, or direct email.

In general I think this is a good idea; please try to keep it as
simple as possible and ensure that continuity is preserved so that
sitting Officers don't find themselves with no Salary when this is
adopted.

There's also the fact that people told me I should repost the message to 
a public forum.  Surely that ment they must of thought that the message 
was "clearly" intended for the public forum.  Although you could also 
argue that they did so only because, they realised that in general such 
messages are usually posted to the public forum.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 7]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

|     (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
|         is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
|         Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
|         same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
|         automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
|         a Discussion Forum.
| 
|     (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

|     (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
|         message sent, by any medium or combination of media,
|         excluding any medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to
          every Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

|     (f) A message sent to a Discussion Forum is deemed to have NOT
|         been sent to the Public Forum even if it would otherwise be
|         one under subsection (e) of this Rule.
| 
|     (g) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

Protoproposal Chaos75 [rev. 4]

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
|       (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.

As far as I can see, Private Transfer Orders for P-Notes are effective if
sent to the Promotor through agora-discussion.

making the Discussion Forum ineffective as a means for conducting official

Only if you insist on holding that a resent message is the same
message, as opposed to being a different message with identical
content.  Since the time at which a message was sent is part of the
properties of a message, I think it is quite clear that a resent
message is not identical with the original.

I'll have to think of a way to word that.  "Official business" is a
dangerous term because it presumes Officerness; we don't want to limit 
it to business with Officers, I don't think.

Well, consider Cc:s, then.

No, the URL you posted is incorrect.  I should have made more of an effort
to before I sent that message.  I figured out very quickly how to access the
archive once I took a moment to look.

Protoproposal Chaos44 [rev. 8]

Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
|         message sent, by any medium or combination of media, other
|         than a medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every
|         Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

|     (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.
| 
|     (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
|         Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
|         message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Medium to send
|         such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
|         Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
|         that message.

What about them?  

I've got a next revision written and will submit it for consideration
shortly.  It allows the recipient of a message sent via a DF to "cure"
it by acknowledging receipt of the message.

Actually, this doesn't work out very well. It will be that there is
a fixed, and limited remnant to divide among the unemployed. The more
players there are, the less each unemployed player gets. At least under
the current system all unemployed players get a reasonable amount, no
matter how many of them there are.

This isn't really a critical part of the system anyway. It would probably
work just as well, and would be simpler to implement, if the unemployed
just continued to get a fixed wage.

Or: Another possible power for the Registrar would be to allow em to set
the unemployment benefit, anywhere between 0 and 1 BOS. That'd make eir
Election a bit more interesting...

"Discretion" which is "sound".  Am I now a dictionary?

The OED offers several definitions for "sound" as an adjective; I
suggest that "8. a. In full accordance with fact, reason, or good
sense; founded on true or well-established grounds; free from error,
fallacy, or logical defect; good, strong, valid" is most appropriate,
although "9. Based on or characterized by well-grounded principles or
good practical knowledge" is also pertinent.

I trust I need not define "discretion".

I had an idea last night about Gen Chaos' "Make the Proposal Queue More
Competitive" Proposal. I rather like the concept, but something about his
implementation is a bit clunky. It occured to me that a better way to
implement this would be to reduce the MUQ of P-Notes to 0.1, and allow 
non-integral Priorities, which go up and down in equal amounts to the 
number of P-Notes spent on them. Then allow the Promotor to set a "bar
height" which Priorities have to exceed into order for the Proposal to
be distributed. Ordinarily the bar height would be 1.0. Proposals with
Priority less than that remain in the Queue, in the same way as zero
priority proposals currently do.

The advantages, as I see it, are four-fold:

1) Players can share the risk on a proposal by paying half a P-Note each,
and splitting the 2 P-Note award.

2) There are still some Priorities above 1 that result in a net profit 
if the proposal passes. This is something that has frustrated me for a 
while. If you want to try to push a proposal up beyond Priority 1, then
you have to abandon all chance of profit on that proposal. This has stopped
me from bothering on more than one occasion. If Priorities in between 1 and
2 are allowed, then there is room to sacrifice just a little of your profit
in order to get your Proposal distributed sooner.

3) Of course, it allows the Promotor to regulated the outflow of the 
P-note economy.

4) (And this is perhaps the real benefit over the General's proposal) 
It makes sense for the Promotor to set the bar height to zero. At 
this point, proposing becomes free. Those with cash can still push
to the front of the Queue, but it is still possible to get a proposal
distributed without paying anything. This should appeal to the democrats
out there, and make for more political manoevring for the Promotor's Office.

Need we be concerned about allowing the Proposal Bar and Proposal
Priorities to be any real number?  I'd be worried about having
irrationals creep in.

Otherwise, you've saved me the trouble of drafting a new Proposal,
which I won't have time for for at least three more days.

Well, they shouldn't given the existing means of changing the Priority,
but I admit that I also don't much like it. Would it make sense to
say that the Priority is an integer multiple of the MUQ of P-Notes.
