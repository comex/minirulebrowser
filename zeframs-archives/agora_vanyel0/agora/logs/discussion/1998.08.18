I know. I was the one who made the proposal allowing that. But what I
am suggesting goes a little further. In particular, it would allow a
player to take on another's debt, even if e didn't currently have the
funds to pay it off.

Actually, I would question whether Rule 1023 _can_ defer to Rule 1686 in
the sense of "defer" that appears in R1030.  R1030 only applies to Rules
with equal precedence, and no such clause appears in R1482 (Precedence
Between Rules with Unequal Power).

Nonetheless, I agree with Michael that if one Rule says I must do something
within 5 days and another says I must also do it within 3 days, they are
not in conflict.

(Only if the first Rule had wording to the effect that I have 5 days to do
the thing without penalty, would there be a conflict.)

That's a strange definition of conflict, then. It seems to me that if
two Rules are such that they differ substantially in the requirements
they impose, this can be called a conflict. The 'also' that you insert
above is *not* present in the Rule itself, and your interpretation of
the situation as non-conflictual relies on that 'also'.
