I note that the motivation for this Proposal is inconsistent with that
of 'Restore Sanity'.

I disagree.  This Proposal, if adopted, would impose "Sanity" (as
defined by Rule 1723) on every Proposal.  Hence, the title is entirely
appropriate.

Steve, your methods of opposing this Proposal are bordering on the
dishonorable.  Next you'll be accusing me of having an unregistered
nanny, or something.

Which Proposal are you talking about? I agree that that the Title of
'Restore Sanity' is appropriate, in that that Proposal makes every
Proposal Sane in the sense of R1723. But my comment was directed at
'Unlimited Voting', which would allow every Voting Entity an unlimited
number of votes on a Proposal, which is very far from Sanity. Both
Proposals amend R206 in different and inconsistent ways, and therefore
my remark was entirely appropriate. I wasn't even attacking 'Unlimited
Voting'; I was only pointing out that we shouldn't rationally adopt both
it and 'Restore Sanity'. Of the two, I oppose 'Restore Sanity' much more
strongly. I won't be voting for 'Unlimited Voting', either, but it's not
nearly so objectionable.

Ah, I see what you are trying to hint at.  I do not believe that I am
required to make all of my Proposals consistent with each other,
either in effect or in philosophy.

Hsm, "A Duty to Vote" will also penalise players who are denied voting
privileges. That's a bit unfair. But I suppose you would expect that such
Players would not have 3 VTs in the first place.

Ahem, R1863 excuses Players who are denied Voting Privileges at the
time a Proposal is distributed from incurring a duty to vote. Since
Denial of Voting Privileges occurs from fixed Monday-to-Monday fortnight
periods, a problem could only arise were Proposals to be distributed
late on a Sunday night (GMT), and some Player's period of DVP was to
commence immediately afterward.
