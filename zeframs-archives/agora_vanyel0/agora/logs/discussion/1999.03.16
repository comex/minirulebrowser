Protoproposal Chaos66 [rev. 4]

Cleanup of R.1006

Be it resolved, that Rule 1006 be amended to read:

      (a) An Office is any position established by the Rules as such.

      (b) At any time, a given Office is held by exactly one Player. 
          If an Office would otherwise not be held by any Player, it
          shall be held by the Speaker.

      (c) An Officer is any Player who holds an Office.

      (d) A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
          privileges that the Rules assign to it.

[Most of the rest of the current R.1006 is superfluous baggage.]
