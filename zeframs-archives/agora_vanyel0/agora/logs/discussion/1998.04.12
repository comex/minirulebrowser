With regard to bills, I would prefer it if they only happened as the
result of Player actions, rather than as automatic weekly events. This
is the way things are at the moment, and I'd rather keep it that way.
It means that the number of bills a Player is likely to face is more
or less proportional to eir activity in the game. Thus different 
players can have different degrees of involvement, and a Player can
be inactive for a period of time without having to worry too much about
going deep into debt while e is away.

I have tried to come up with an alternative formulation for paying 
maintenance on Plots, but I cannot find one which fits our Currency 
framework and does not involve excessive billing.

I am not as enthuastic about Plots as I once was, because in the mean-
time we have reorganised our economy somewhat, and I would like to 
explore the new arrangement for a while, and see whether or not Plots
would still be an improvement. It may be that they are no longer 
necessary.

It occurs to me that there is no good reason for R1732 to require
the payor of a given PO to make the correspong TO to satisfy it.
Why not let any player do so? Is there any harm in letting me
satisfy another player's bills? It could be very useful, especially
if a player went on hold, or went AWOL for a while. Rather than let
Blots rack up, for unexpected debts, another player could pay off
any bills, and be recompensed when the player returns.

Well, the Maintenance Fees are only billed in response to a Player action
(specifically the Cartographor), but I'm sure that's not what you meant.

Players planning to be inactive for a while could give eir Plots to another
player, under the condition that e would get them back upon eir return.

Another alternative:  A Player doesn't get eir Production unless e pays
eir Maintenance Fee.  Maintenance Fees left unpaid for a week or so are
simply vacated.
