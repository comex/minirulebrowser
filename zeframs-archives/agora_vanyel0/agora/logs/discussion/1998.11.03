Round it to the even integer. Spreadsheet programs should have a

It doesn't seem to have taken effect yet - your message did not get
through to discussion, anyhow.

The From envelope uses ford@bayside.net so should be OK.

I now see one more thing which might have an effect:

Received: from windowsnt.bayside.net ([4.21.67.2] EHLO windowsnt ident:
    NO-IDENT-SERVICE [port 14859]) by sabre-wulf.nvg.ntnu.no with ESMTP id
    <49244-20196>; Tue, 3 Nov 1998 07:04:44 +0100

It seems that the mail server at bayside identifies itself solely as
"windowsnt" in the EHLO command.  This is of course not a full Internet
address either, although I don't think there is an official syntax
requirement in this case.  If changing your own setup doesn't work, you
might want to talk to Bayside about that.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

FYI:

I am quite willing to work on and eventually  issue an Accountor's
report, but if i am deregistered because of my Blots, I will take all
my records with me, and someone else will have to do all that work, or
you will have to have a currency reform.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 2]

Currencies

| [Title I: Currencies]
| 
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:
| 
|     Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
|     Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
|     of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
|     be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
|     transferred.  The units thus transferred will become the owner
|     of the entity receiving them, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
|     this on eir records.
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the Clerk of
          the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

|     (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
|         the entity so desires.]

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

|     (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
|         quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
|         execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
|         entity as payee and the Bank as payor.
| 
|     (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
|         some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
|         Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
|         payor and the Bank as payee.

|     (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
|         Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
|         the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
|         the reason therefore.

|     (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
|         noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
|         the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
|         Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
|         set forth therein is correct.
| 
|     (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
|         performed as soon as possible after they arise.
| 
|     (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
|         considered an Officer.

| [Title II: Probate adjustments]

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

|     (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have
|         a Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
|         entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
|         Public Forum.
| 
|     (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
|         appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
|         following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
|       (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
|           number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
|           Probate; and
|       (2) by the Notary, a list of all Demands for Payment executed 
|           with the entity in Probate as either payee or payor.
| 
|     (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of 
|         the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
|         the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
|         possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or was not
|         named as the payor or payee in any Demand for Payment, as 
|         appropriate to the type of records not received.
| 
|     (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
|         appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
|         debts due to the entity in Probate.
| 
|     (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
|         inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
|         Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
|         within that time is deemed cancelled.
| 
|     (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
|         disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
|         disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
|         after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
|         do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule.
| 
|     (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
|         and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
|         of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
|         provisions of the Probate Code.
| 
|     (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
|         (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
|         waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
|         Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
|         this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
|         implement the Plan for disposition.
| 
|     (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
|         adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
|         as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
|       (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
|           Plan; or
|       (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
|           foundation.
| 
|     (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
|         Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
|         formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
|         the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
|         foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
|         objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
|         that same objection again shall be disregarded.
| 
|     (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it 
|         correctly alleges that:
|       (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
|           of the Probate Code; 
|       (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
|           Probate; 
|       (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
|           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
|           in Probate; or
|       (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
|           entity in Probate. 
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
|       (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
|           owed a debt; and 
|       (2) does not have an Executor.
| 
|     (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
|         is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
|         aware of the dissolute entity.
| 
|     (b) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
|         existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
|         Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it
|         is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have
|         legal existence prior to that time.  An entity which has
|         legal existence solely to this subdivision is called
|         "terminal".
| 
|     (c) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in 
|         Probate:
|       (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
|           along with all debts owed to the entity in Probate.
|       (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
|       (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
|           the entity in Probate.
|       (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
|           the entity in Probate.
|       (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
|           Probate.
|       (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
|           in Probate.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
|         Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
|       (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
|           creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
|           amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
|           all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.  
|       (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
|           remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
|           shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
|           entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
|           explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
|           divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
|           Will.
|       (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
|           point shall be assigned to the Bank.
| 
|     (b) Methods of assignment:
|       (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
|           that those units of Currency be transferred from the
|           entity in Probate to that entity.
|       (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
|           requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
|           a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
|           shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
|           assigned. 
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
|         Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
|         in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
|         Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
|         that entity requires it.
| 
|     (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
|         the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.
| 
|     (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:

|           or

DIS: proto: Currencies (Chaos56, rev. 2)

Ah, I see.  This makes it the responsibility of each payee to keep track of how
much is owed, rather than the Recordkeepors.  I think I like this solution,
although I still need to check out the consequences of the repeals.

A couple of questions.  The description of Currency denominations seems
overly complicated to me.  What is the reason for having a "primary
denomination" in addition to a "smallest indivisible unit"?

How will this work with existing Currencies?  In particular, you are repealing
the definition of MUQ but apparently leaving references to it in the Rules for
each of our existing "intangible" Currencies.  Shouldn't the primary
denominations and smallest indivisible units of each be specified instead?

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 2]

Currencies

| [Title I: Currencies]
| 
Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:
| 
|     Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
|     Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
|     of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
|     be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
|     transferred.  The units thus transferred will become the owner
|     of the entity receiving them, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
|     this on eir records.
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the Clerk of
          the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

|     (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
|         the entity so desires.]

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

|     (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
|         quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
|         execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
|         entity as payee and the Bank as payor.
| 
|     (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
|         some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
|         Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
|         payor and the Bank as payee.

|     (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
|         Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
|         the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
|         the reason therefore.

|     (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
|         noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
|         the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
|         Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
|         set forth therein is correct.
| 
|     (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
|         performed as soon as possible after they arise.
| 
|     (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
|         considered an Officer.

| [Title II: Probate adjustments]

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

|     (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have
|         a Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
|         entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
|         Public Forum.
| 
|     (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
|         appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
|         following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
|       (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
|           number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
|           Probate; and
|       (2) by the Notary, a list of all Demands for Payment executed 
|           with the entity in Probate as either payee or payor.
| 
|     (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of 
|         the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
|         the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
|         possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or was not
|         named as the payor or payee in any Demand for Payment, as 
|         appropriate to the type of records not received.
| 
|     (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
|         appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
|         debts due to the entity in Probate.
| 
|     (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
|         inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
|         Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
|         within that time is deemed cancelled.
| 
|     (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
|         disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
|         disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
|         after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
|         do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule.
| 
|     (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
|         subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
|         and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
|         of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
|         provisions of the Probate Code.
| 
|     (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
|         (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
|         waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
|         Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
|         this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
|         implement the Plan for disposition.
| 
|     (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
|         adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
|         as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
|       (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
|           Plan; or
|       (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
|           foundation.
| 
|     (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
|         Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
|         formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
|         the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
|         foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
|         objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
|         that same objection again shall be disregarded.
| 
|     (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it 
|         correctly alleges that:
|       (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
|           of the Probate Code; 
|       (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
|           Probate; 
|       (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
|           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
|           in Probate; or
|       (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
|           entity in Probate. 
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
|       (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
|           owed a debt; and 
|       (2) does not have an Executor.
| 
|     (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
|         is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
|         aware of the dissolute entity.
| 
|     (b) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
|         existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
|         Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it
|         is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have
|         legal existence prior to that time.  An entity which has
|         legal existence solely to this subdivision is called
|         "terminal".
| 
|     (c) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in 
|         Probate:
|       (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
|           along with all debts owed to the entity in Probate.
|       (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
|       (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
|           the entity in Probate.
|       (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
|           the entity in Probate.
|       (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
|           Probate.
|       (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
|           in Probate.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
|         Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
|       (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
|           creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
|           amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
|           all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.  
|       (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
|           remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
|           shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
|           entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
|           explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
|           divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
|           Will.
|       (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
|           point shall be assigned to the Bank.
| 
|     (b) Methods of assignment:
|       (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
|           that those units of Currency be transferred from the
|           entity in Probate to that entity.
|       (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
|           requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
|           a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
|           shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
|           assigned. 
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
|         Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
|         in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
|         Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
|         that entity requires it.
| 
|     (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
|         the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.
| 
|     (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
|       (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
|       (2) e ceases to be a Player;
|       (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
|           or 
|       (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.
| 
|     (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
|         Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
|         Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.
| 
|     (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
|         disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
|         by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

| Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,
| 1577, 1579, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, and 1823 all be repealed.

I'm by no means done with this proto; while the "meat" of the law is
written, I still have quite a bit of work to do on the conforming
amendments.

Then i suggest keeping the MUQ language intact.  It is well worded and
time tested.

Mainly because I don't want to foreclose making a real tangible

Protoproposal Chaos58 [rev. 1]

Proposals may Order

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1794 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Order is of one of the following classes:
        (1) Judicial: A Judicial Order is an Order executed by a
            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals. 
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

      (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer when performing a duty which is
          required of em by virtue of being the Speaker, or when
          exercising a privilege granted em by virtue of being the
          Speaker.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.  

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 3]

Currencies

| [Currencies]

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred.  The units thus transferred will become the owner
      of the entity receiving them, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the Clerk of
          the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
          the entity so desires.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
          the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
          the reason therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

| [Probate]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have
          a Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, a list of all Demands for Payment executed 
            with the entity in Probate as either payee or payor.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of 
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or was not
          named as the payor or payee in any Demand for Payment, as 
          appropriate to the type of records not received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it 
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code; 
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate; 
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and 
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (b) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it
          is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have
          legal existence prior to that time.  An entity which has
          legal existence solely to this subdivision is called
          "terminal".

      (c) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in 
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
            along with all debts owed to the entity in Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.  
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or 
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

| [Taxes]
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
|         it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
|         permitting the levy.
| 
|     (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
|         An announcement of levy must specify:
|       (1) The Currency being taxed;
|       (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of the
|           holdings of the Currency being taxed; and
|       (3) a brief statement of the legal authorization for the levy.
| 
|     (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
|         subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
|         Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
|         stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
|         stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
|         debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
|         that entity at the time the announcement was made.
| 
|     (d) If the Currency taxed is intangible, the Recordkeepor of the
|         Currency named in a tax levy shall, as soon as possible
|         after the announcement, provide a report setting out the
|         amount of the taxed Currency held by every entity which held
|         any units of that Currency at the time the announcement was
|         made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to compute the tax
|         due; if e does so, eir computations do not have any legal
|         force. 
| 
|     (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
|         holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
|         permits it.
| 
| [Conforming Amendments]
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended by deleting the
| paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended by deleting the
| paragraph which reads "Each Contest has Mint Authority."
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,
1577, 1579, 1819, 1820, 1821, 1822, and 1823 all be repealed.

This is nice.

What about a proposal that reads 

>>
Upon the adoption of this proposal, the Chancellor is required and
authorized to pay out 20 indulgences and 2 VTs to lee.
<<

Such a proposal might be a nice way of writing an amnesty/reward for
lee's hard work.

At first sight I thought that we'd need the Legislative Orders
amendment to make this work. But as it stands now, the proposals
creates a requirement on an officer, so one could argue that the
proposal, once adopted, creates a "duty of an office" and thus
authorizes the Chancellor (in this case) to execute the relevant POs
as administrative orders.

I would like this.  To be fair, you may want to add a clause punishing
me again if i fail to produce the report after some time limit :-)

The problem is that a Proposal lacks the power to, by itself, compel
Player obedience.  The Rules require Players to obey the Rules.  They
do not require Players to obey adopted Proposals.

            Player while acting as a Judge.
        (2) Appellate: An Appellate Order is an Order executed by a
            Board of Appeals. 
        (3) Administrative: An Administrative Order is an Order
            executed by an Officer in the course of performing the
            duties of that Office, except when those duties involve
            acting as a member of a Board of Appeals.
        (4) Legislative: A Legislative Order is an Order executed as
            part of the effect of the adoption of a Proposal.
        (5) Private: A Private Order is any Order not described above.

|     (b) For the purpose of this Rule, the holder of any of the
|         following positions shall be considered an Officer when
|         performing a duty required by or a privilege permitted only
|         by virtue of holding that position:
|       (1) the Speaker;
|       (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
|       (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.  

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, are deemed to have been executed by that
          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos56 [rev. 4]

Currencies

[Currencies]

| Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:
| 
|     There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.
| 
| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

|     (e) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
|         schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
|         Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
|         whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
|         least the following information:
|       (1) For each Currency, the designated denomination or
|           denominations of that Currency (and if more than one, the
|           relationship between them) and the fraction of the
|           smallest such denomination which is the smallest
|           indivisible unit; and
|       (2) For each intangible Currency, the Recordkeepor and, if
|           any, the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency.
|       
Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred.  The units thus transferred will become the owner
      of the entity receiving them, and the Recordkeepor shall so note
      this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the Clerk of
          the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
          the entity so desires.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
          the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
          the reason therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

[Probate]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have
          a Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
|       (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
|           been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of 
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
|         possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
|         have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
|         received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it 
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code; 
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate; 
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and 
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (b) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it
          is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have
          legal existence prior to that time.  An entity which has
          legal existence solely to this subdivision is called
          "terminal".

      (c) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in 
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
            along with all debts owed to the entity in Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.  
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

      (b) Methods of assignment:
        (1) Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring
            that those units of Currency be transferred from the
            entity in Probate to that entity.
        (2) A debt owed by the entity in Probate is assigned by
            requiring the execution of a Notice of Debt setting forth
            a debt identical to the debt to be assigned except that it
            shall be due to the entity to whom the debt is being
            assigned. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is authorized, all other
          Rules notwithstanding, to transfer Currency from the entity
          in Probate to any other entity as if e were that entity's
          Executor, when the Plan for the disposition of the estate of
          that entity requires it.

      (b) The Trustee may execute Notices of Debt when the Plan for
          the disposition of the estate of the entity requires it.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or 
        (4) the Notary announces that the Trustee has been removed.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

      (e) Upon the completion of the implementation of a Plan for the
          disposition of the Estate of an entity, all debts owed to or
          by that entity are deemed to be satisfied.

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:
| 
|     (a) A Will is a document created by an entity which specifies
|         how that entity prefers that its assets be disposed of in
|         the event that it becomes dissolute.
| 
|     (b) The Trustee of an entity in Probate shall, in constructing
|         the Plan for the disposal of the estate of that entity, be
|         bound by and shall follow the provisions of that entity's
|         Will to the extent that those provisions are applicable and
|         not inconsistent with the Rules.
| 
|     (c) An entity may file its Will with the Notary.  The Notary
|         shall retain a copy of each Will filed with em until such
|         time as that entity files a new Will or files a notice with
|         the Notary cancelling the prior Will.

[Taxes]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized by the Rule
          permitting the levy.

      (b) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of the
            holdings of the Currency being taxed; and
        (3) a brief statement of the legal authorization for the levy.

      (c) Upon the announcement of a tax levy conforming with
          subdivision (b) of this Rule, each entity other than the
          Bank becomes liable to the Bank for a debt equal to the
          stated percentage of that entity's holdings of the Currency
          stated in the announcement.  The amount of each entity's tax
          debt shall be based on the amount of that Currency owned by
          that entity at the time the announcement was made.

      (d) If the Currency taxed is intangible, the Recordkeepor of the
          Currency named in a tax levy shall, as soon as possible
          after the announcement, provide a report setting out the
          amount of the taxed Currency held by every entity which held
          any units of that Currency at the time the announcement was
          made.  The Recordkeepor is not required to compute the tax
          due; if e does so, eir computations do not have any legal
          force. 

      (e) The amount of tax levied may not exceed 50% of an entity's
          holdings unless the Rule which authorizes the tax explicitly
          permits it.

[Conforming Amendments]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 766 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Group has Mint Authority."

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1466 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which reads "Each Contest has Mint Authority."

| Be it further resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended by replacing the
| term "Payment Order" with the term "Notice of Debt" wherever it may
| appear.
| 
Be it further resolved, that Rules 1599, 1722, 1730, 1732, 1734, 1576,

I know lots of people who are dissolute who fulfil neither of the

Lessee, what is so difficult about all this then?

My pet peeves if you will.

Vagueness.  

Reassignment of PO#s with no table to tell me which the original
officer given numbers were.  While it is useful for the Accountor to
issue eir own numbers, it is maddening to match up these POs.  

Players who don't bring a problem to my attention as soon as possible. 
Steve is least guilty of this, he points out most errors he sees very
promptly.  There were some errors in my first report that went
unreported until the last report i did.  6 revisions these errors made
it through and then got reported!

Players who have a nice column format going for say, Officers salaries,
and then break the column format for a few orders and then resume
another format for say the unemployment orders. If the entire message
were in one  column format it would be at least one third less the
work.  I can manipulate columned text  in a text processor and cut and
paste it into a spreadsheet.  by changing formats. i have to do this
twice and then extract the middle orders by hand.  

Officers who don't use the column format at all.

Players who think they paid something and did not, or think someone
else did so and they did not.

People who bury a TO in a bunch of text.  

When it is unclear if the officer or executor is ordering the Bank to
pay, or paying something as a Player.  Some of the first patronage POs
i dealt with were vague.

And things that make me smile and wish pleasantness at Players.

When a Player quotes the PO they are paying. if they include the time
stamp or the message id even better.  I love this.  It makes it easy to
match it up with no errors.

Players who use a consistent column layout even for one TO.

Players who put the word hereby in the message.  Easy to search for.  
Transfer is in too many headers to be useful.  

Players who put TO or PO in the subject.  I especially love the subject
"Voting TO".

Officers who use concise unique identifiers for the PO's  aaa234 may
not mean as much as RVTPO234, but it is shorter on my report.  I do
appreciate that there are unique identifiers even if they are long.  i
can do a search for aaa and know that i will get TOs and POs.

Things i hate but are my own doing or no one elses fault.

Calculating the Credits and Debits  I know there must be an easier way.
 I will find it.

Missing a failed TO.  This is a nightmare to retrace.

I accidentally deleted one of my reports, and only had the email copy. 
It was a pain to remake it. I still think it is not quite right.

Vacated POs.

Long and short Player names.   lee and Antimatter are both a pain when
i format the report.
