I remind Players that as of the passage of 'No Presence' R1715 is
without effect for the next two months. As I understand the situation,
since votes are counted at the end of the VP, even declarations of
Presence on the current Proposals (3758-3760) which were made before
'No Presence' took effect will not be counted when votes are tallied.
Certainly declaraitons of Presence made since 'No Presence' took effect
will not be counted.

I will post a Voting Reminder shortly.

Which is one of the major loopholes I hoped to fix before Plots 
became active. <Sigh>

I don't have time or inclination to finish the Plot Pragmatisation
job at the moment. Does anyone else want to run with this?

On the other hand, to deny the fact that a particular number has specific
mathematical properties arising out of the basic axioms of mathematics, simply
because no one has ever actually inspected that particular number for those
properties seems like the worst kind of anthropocentric egotism to me.  Of
course, this may not be what constructionists are saying but there is nothing
"mysterious" about a proof which says "inspect every integer in sequence until
you find one that has the properties you are looking for" since it is clear
that given no limitation in time, if such an integer exists, you will
eventually find it.  I guess I'm saying that such a proof does not transcend
our ability to determine whether it is correctly applied, since it's correct
application can be seen in the first iterations of the process - it does not
require that the process be complete before we can see that it is being
correctly applied.
