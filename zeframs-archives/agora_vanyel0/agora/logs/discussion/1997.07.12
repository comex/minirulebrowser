You didn't actually misunderstand; rather, I failed to fully elaborate
my idea.  Your reaction was quite reasonable.

"Any requirements placed on a Player by an adopted Proposal to perform
 some action or avoid performing some action are effective, but only
 during the two-week period beginning at the time of the Proposal's
 adoption."

Limiting it to a single requirement is probably tougher.  Any suggestions?

May I ask why?  Chuck has been Rulekeepor for over three years now, and
I have been Archivist for almost three (except for a three-month period
when I lost access).  If it ever comes to the point where someone is
abusing this, you can always send through a proposal to depose them, but
until and unless that happens nobody has to worry about elections.

Those are good points - but then again, one might wonder what Elections
are good for, then. Why not just install someone in Office and, when
you get tired of em, depose them via a Proposal or an impeachment
Referendum ? Now as I stated, I would raise an Objection if, say,
it was suggested to make the Office of Rulekeepor in perpetuity,
because there is no good reason to do so other than the contingent
fact that Chuck has held it for such a long time.

The point is, if someone wants to be RK, e has an opportunity to do
so four times a year, without incurring the costs or hassles of
submitting a Proposal or an Impeachment Referendum. Isn't that
precisely why Elections came about in the first place ?

I do think the case of the Archivist is slightly different, because
it could be bothersome to transfer all the records that pertain to
that office every three months - how much, in bytes, do these amount
to, btw ? But that's the only valid exception I see, and if that is
the case we should enact a Rule to reflect that particular exception,
as we did in the case of the Distributor.

Who was it said recently that the business of making exceptions is
a dangerous one, IIRC it was Steve ?

Or does this count as changing my Vote ? Anyway, the net effect is the
same, so I'm not worrying. Who cares about two measly VTs anyway...

Actually, it doesn't really bother me that much.  I'll probably
just announce my presence on this one.  I'd be quite flattered
if Agorans chose to bestow this honor on me, but I wouldn't
be upset if they didn't.

Um, as long as you're going to re-propose it, why not a
more general rewrite?  I feel that secrecy should be orthogonal
to friendliness--that is, it should be possible for a nomic
to be secretly friendly as well as secretly hostile.

Hrm, I suppose we don't want a Report of Secretly Hostile Nomics being
generally available.  How about this?

     Upon request, the CinC shall provide any Senator with a list of all
     Secretly Hostile Nomics.  Any Player who informs a non-Senator that
     a given Nomic is Secretly Hostile commits the [Crime/Infraction] of
     Thwarting the War Effort, whose penalty of [whatever] is reported
     by the CinC.

While this seems to be legal, I would like to note for the
record that this was done without consulting any other
members of the Misanthropist's Group (as far as I know).

I'd deKudo Morendil, except I think he probably lost more
than he deserved for the Rishon incident, and he *does*
bring up a loophole which ought to be fixed.

What does Rule 1586 have to do with it ? No such Currencies
(or, for that matter, Entities) currently exist, do they ?

Aw, come on - what's Dishonorable about such an act ? You wouldn't
mind my minting Group Coins for Misanthropists, would you - even
without consulting you ? Well, just consider the three new Currencies
as Misanthropists' Group Coins.

I'm not sure what the point of this is: Orders, Transfer Orders, and
Payment Orders (as Pragmatic Currencies would create them) are not
Currencies, and are also not entities, but classes of entities.  I
therefore do not believe that Rule 1586 applies.

It seems to me that a class of Nomic Entities, if defined
as such by the Rules, is also a Nomic Entity in itself.

I'm not convinced of that.

In any case, the Rule which allows the minting of Currency defers to
both of the Rules which will, if Pragmatic Currencies is adopted,
define Transfer Orders (Rule 1598) and Payment Orders (Rule 1596).
Therefore, the properties ascribed to Transfer Orders and Payment
Orders by these Rules will take precedence over those ascribed to them
by the operation of Rule 1722.

Considering that Morendil could have done this under his own name
(Players have Mint Authority too), it was wholly unnecessary for him
to use the Misanthropist's Group as a vehicle for his actions.

Care to elaborate on whether you think there is one?  Or, in general,

I also must wonder why you seek to sabotage a Reform you feel is

Oh, I only did that because I felt it was more elegant - bringing back
reminiscences of Group Coins, and leaving the possibility of later
handing on the responsibility for these interesting Currencies to some
other Player should I no longer be able to assume those duties for
unforeseen reasons.

Tell you what, if Chuck asks me to, I'll be quite happy to destroy the
Currencies and recreate them in my own name - there are about 12 hours left to
go until the VP on the PC Proposal ends. Of course I'd have liked to have
Swann's opinion, but me and Chuck make up a majority of Misanthropists after
all, so that's okay.

So, hey, no big deal, right ?

Assuming that the new Currencies are Entities, and the Entities of the
same name that the Rules created by P/C, assuming it passes, are too,
my opinion is that Rule 1586 dictates that the new Rules will merely
amend the Properties of Payment Orders and Transfer Orders so that
they can have the stated behaviour _in addition_ to being Currencies.

I've researched this carefully, and it seems to me that there is no conflict 
between the stated properties of POs and TOs, and the fact of their being 
Currencies. In particular, none of the new Rules will directly require the
Creation of units of those Currencies, just their automatic submission.

Well, the Reform is needed - but there is little harm in having some fun
with it along the way. And I'll note that while I fully supported the P/C
Proposal, I was much more lukewarm with respect to "Extend the Mint",
as you'll recall - a previous reform which is the root cause of any problems
arising out of my perfectly legal Minting of some Currencies.

Also, keep in mind that Rule 114 should not have to intervene. I - or the
Misanthropists - will be able to mint POs and TOs as needed to adopt Proposals,
so at no time should it be in principle impossible to Vote on and adopt
Proposals. All it takes is one PO/TO pair (for one FOR Vote), and enough
declarations of Presence, for a Proposal to pass.

I tend to believe that there are conflicts.  More accurately, I
believe that thare are sufficient reasons to believe that the two
classes of entity are sufficiently incompatible with each other for
them to be considered equivalent, or for them to be merged.  I note
that I'm not convinced that Transfer Orders are Nomic Entities,
because it appears to be implied that a Transfer Order, like a
Proposal, is essentially a body of text, and bodies of text have an
existence beyond that ascribed to them by the Rules.  (There is, for
example, nothing in Proposal 3533 pertaining to the creation of
Transfer Orders.)  The same, of course, goes for Payment Orders.
Currencies, on the other hand, are clearly Nomic Entities.  Equating a
Nomic Entity with a non-Nomic Entity would destroy the
Nomic-Entity-ness of the Nomic Entity, which to me seems to be a
highly fundamental characteristic of an entity.

Further, there is, I believe, a precedent that the mere fact that two
clearly disparate things share a name does not make them equivalent to
each other.  See, for example, the "person" debate, or the Nomic
Potato Judgement (Vanyel, can you dig this up for me?).  (In fact,
this situation almost exactly mirrors the Nomic Potato scam, which, as
I recall, failed.)

Well - as you'll have guessed, I think that there are arguments on both
sides of the issue. The following is one that I studied in some detail :

> I note that I'm not convinced that Transfer Orders are Nomic Entities, because
> it appears to be implied that a Transfer Order, like a Proposal, is
> essentially a body of text, and bodies of text have an existence beyond that
> ascribed to them by the Rules. 

I humbly submit that merely because an Entity is defined to be equivalent to a
body of text, that does not make it _not_ a Nomic Entity. Proposals,
Application, SLCs, Wills are collections of text. I think that most Players
would readily call them Nomic Entities; for instance, without the Wills Rule,
a Will wouldn't "exist" - it would be just another collection of text,
undistinguishable in this regard from this message, yesterday's New York Times,
or the Constitution of the United States.

Similarly, I note that the Rules call for an Application to be "created" at a
certain time, and "destroyed" at most fourteen days after its creation. This
wouldn't make any sense unless an Application were a Nomic Entity; if I were to
create an Application by writing it on a piece of paper, it would "exist" as a
non-NE for as long as I held on to that scrap of paper, regardless of what Rule
1626 states. If the Rules required a certain type of Application to be
Executed by sending them to you, you could, regardless of what Rule 1626
states, destroy it after its Execution by burning the paper up, etc.

Lastly, if we take the line that the definition of NEs as "only existing by
virtue of the Rules defining it to exist" in the strict manner that you
suggest, then we would have to conclude that Rule 1011's definition of a Nomic
Property as a property that an Entity "possesses solely by the virtue of the
Rules defining that property" then we would have to conclude that the text of
a Will, an SLC, an Application, or a Proposal are _not_ protected by Rule 1011 - 
a body of text's contents is a property that is not solely the result of a
Rule - and thus that it would be perfectly legal (given Rule 116) for the
Promotor to change the text of a Proposal, if, say, that Proposal had been sent
to em in a letter, by striking out parts of it or adding new text.

Moving on to a second argument :

> Further, there is, I believe, a precedent that the mere fact that two
> clearly disparate things share a name does not make them equivalent to
> each other.  See, for example, the "person" debate, or the Nomic
> Potato Judgement (Vanyel, can you dig this up for me?).  (In fact,
> this situation almost exactly mirrors the Nomic Potato scam, which, as
> I recall, failed.)

If that were the case, the problem would be that TOs, POs and Orders are now
unquestionably Currencies. Alongside those Currencies would also exist Entities
with the same Names, which Rule 1586 does not prevent if those other Entities
are _not_ Nomic Entities. (If they are, what other sensible interpretation of
Rule 1586 is there except as stating that the two Nomic Entities are the same?)
But then, the problem is that nothing would prevent (and Rule 1592 would
permit) me from adding provisions in, say, MFO's Ordinances, stating that a
(Currency) Payment Order has such-and-such a Player as its Executor and becomes
Overdue in such-and-such conditions, and then transferring this hot potato to
an unsuspecting victim just before the Week runs out... "The possibilities", he
said, rubbing hands together, "are limitless."

Not, by any measure, a suffusion of yellow, but definitely an uneasy
situation- and what I wonder, too, is what countermeasures could be adopted by
the Playerhood against my playing such merry pranks - and, on a more rarefied
level, how it would be possible to prevent against similar scams in the future
without sacrificing the Extended Mint.

Disagreement from this quarter. Wills do *not* exist only by virtue of the
Rules. Firstly, the entity itself can exist without the Rules defining it.
That is, the text of such and such a Will would still exist without the
Rules defining Wills. Now, the Rules grant it additional properties -- in
this case, that any text in a Will is followed WRT property distribution
when the Player whose Will it is deregisters -- but do not create it out of
nothing.

And how do we accomplish that? The best I can think of is "If a Rule is
created or amended such that it creates a Nomic Entity with the same name
as an existing Currency which is not defined by the Rules, the name of that
Currency is changed by appending a '2' at its end."

Fine - as long as you're aware that the logical consequence is that the current
1011 doesn't prevent, say, the Notary from changing your Will. The way I read
the Rules, if a body of text is not a Nomic Entity, then the text of an Entity 
which is a body of text is not a Nomic Property.

Also how do you interpret the fact that the Rules call in certain cases for the 
'destruction' of an Application - an Entity which, according to this logic, 
exists independently of the Rules ?
