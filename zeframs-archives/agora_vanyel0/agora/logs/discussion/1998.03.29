It is still too easy for a player to be almost continually Rebellious
(As I see it e can change to Abiding and back to Rebellious in one
posting) and it adds the additional inconvenience of keeping track of
how many switches a player does. 

Or am I the only person who thinks so ?  :o)

Then do you believe it is the proposal as submitted, or the
proposal as distributd which should take effect?

So we can ignore the typo in determining whether the Proposal
was distributed, but not in determining the Proposal's effects?

Ah, the Socratic Method.  I love it!

IMO, the truth or falsity of the CFJ statment rests on whether we consider what
the Promotor distributes to be the Proposal itself or some (potentially
imperfect) representation of the Proposal.  Either way, R107 ensures that such
scrivener's errors will be legally significant.

I seem to recall a CFJ some time ago that may have dealt with this issue wrt
the text submitted to the CotC as a judgement, so there may be some precedent
on this.  Maybe someone with a better memory and/or better access to the Web
can dig that one up.

I am doubting whether this is enough.

As I see it you have
1) Not designated the above an Application
2) Possibly not indicated that you wish to sign it

In addition, depending on what exactly should be the Application text, it
may not clearly identify you as the entity to which it is to belong.

I explained all this in a post to n-d about a week ago - did 
nobody receive it?

R107 makes it pretty clear. The proposal takes effect in the form 
it was voted on - ie, the distributed form.

Yes, because the rules are specific about the the second case, 
but leave the first case open for us to use our common sense. And
that, imho, is the way it should be. In most cases common sense 
should reign, so no strict rules are necessary. But determining 
the effects of a prop is a special case, for which (as others have
already shown) needs more specific rules, vis R107 and R1339.

IMO, it is not common sense to have a single typo be meaningless
for one purpose but meaningful for another.

I agree with the above.  Also, to specifically rebut the false
dichotomy that Oerjan is setting up, I note that it is not
inconsistent to treat the error as legally significant with respect to
the question of the effect of the adoption of the proposal but not
legally significant with respect to the question of whether the
proposed proposal was distributed.  As Blob points out, the question
of the effect of an adopted Proposal is specifically mentioned in the
law.  However, the other cases are not.  There's a canon for this:
"The inclusion of the one is the exclusion of the other."  (There's a
nice Latin phrase for it, but I've forgotten it.)  The fact that other
cases are _not_ specifically mentioned in the law is suggestive that
they do not deserve similar treatment.

Oerjan's false dichotomy is in holding that if an error in
distribution is legally significant in any context, it is legally
significant in every context.  Such a position is neither required nor
preferable.

I read not long ago an interesting discussion in the development of
_stare decisis_ jurisprudence in civil law systems; I think that it's
interesting that, as Agora has matured, that it too has developed a
greater need for judicial lawmaking than it exhibited in its younger
days.  Kolja A., being a citizen of a civil law nation, may understand
better what I am talking about than would those of us who are natives
of common law nations (which encompasses most English-speaking
countries) and who therefore consider the concept of judicial
lawmaking natural.  (I tend to think of Agora as a civil law system,
rather than a common law one.  It would be interesting, if somewhat
bizarre, to play a Nomic under common law.  I suppose I could see a
game of Fascist evolving into a common law system, given enough time.)

I disagree, and in fact argue that it makes perfect sense to do so.
In my opinion, common sense would dictate that this particular error
be treated as insignificant, and ignored.  However, Rule 107 acts to
prevent such treatment in the one specific case of applying the text
of an adopted Proposal.  This results in differential treatment in
that one specific case, because the Rules take precedence over common
sense.

There are countless examples of such situations in "real" law, where a
statutory prescription sets aside a common law presumption in a
specific domain.  The statutory prescription in no way impairs the
common presumption outside of the domain of the statute, which is (as
far as I can tell) exactly what you are trying to argue should be done
in this case.
