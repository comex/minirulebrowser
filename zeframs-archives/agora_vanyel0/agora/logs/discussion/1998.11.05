Currencies

[Currencies]

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1721 be amended to read:

|     There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1467 be amended to read:

      (a) A Currency is any medium of exchange which has been
          designated as a Currency in accordance with the Rules.

      (b) The designation of a medium of exchange as a Currency, and
          the cancellation of such designation, may be accomplished
          only by: 
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater;
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection; or 
        (3) Judicial Order, whenever the Rules so permit.

      (c) For the purposes of the Rules, units of a Currency are
          fungible and indivisible. 

      (d) A Currency may be denominated such that a fraction of its
          primary denomination is its smallest indivisible unit, so
          long as there is a smallest indivisible unit.  When no other
          specification exists, the smallest indivisible unit of a
          Currency shall be one unit of its smallest denomination.
          Amounts less than this smallest indivisible unit may be used
          in intermediate calculations; all such calculations shall be
          rounded off at the point that they are reduced to transfers,
          orders to transfer, or other finalized results of legal
          import.

      (e) The Chancellor shall retain and published at least monthly a
          schedule, listing every medium of exchange designated as a
          Currency under this Rule.  This schedule shall include
          whatever information the Chancellor deems necessary, but at
          least the following information:
        (1) For each Currency, the designated denomination or
            denominations of that Currency (and if more than one, the
            relationship between them) and the fraction of the
            smallest such denomination which is the smallest
            indivisible unit; and
        (2) For each intangible Currency, the Recordkeepor and, if
            any, the Mintor or Mintors of that Currency.
        
Be it further resolved, that a Rule entitled "Intangible Currencies"
be created, reading as follows:

      (a) A Currency, the units of which have no tangible existence,
          is known as an "intangible Currency".
          
      (b) The "Recordkeeper" of an intangible Currency refers to the
          entity who has agreed to maintain a record of the ownership
          of the units of that Currency.  The Recordkeepor of an
          intangible Currency is subject to the jurisdiction of these
          Rules.  Specifically, e shall:
        (1) maintain the abovementioned records in a manner consistent
            with these Rules, including the timely recordation of
            transfers of ownership made consistent with the Rules;
        (2) comply in a timely manner to all requests to produce those
            records as required by the Rules; and
        (3) perform all other duties which the Rules impose upon the
            Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency.

      (c) An intangible Currency may have any number of designated
          Mintors.  A Mintor may be designated for a Currency, or such
          designated cancelled, by:
        (1) the operation of an Instrument with Power 1 or greater; or
        (2) the Chancellor, Without Objection.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      Units of an intangible Currency are transferred only when the
      Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the owner
      of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the units to
      be transferred and the entity who is to owner the units thus
      transferred.  The entity receiving the units thus transferred
      becomes their owner, and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on
      eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1471 be retitled 'Creation of Units
of Currency' and amended to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, creates units of a
          tangible Currency commits the Class B Crime of
          Counterfeiting.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are created only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from a
          designated Mintor of that Currency, specifying the number of
          units to be created and the entity who is to own the units
          so created.  The specified entity owns the units so created,
          and the Recordkeepor shall so note this on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that a new Rule be created with the title
'Destruction of Units of Currency', to read:

      (a) Any entity who, without authorization, destroys units of
          Currency which e does not own is indebted to the owner of
          those units of Currency for the amount thus destroyed.

      (b) Units of an intangible Currency are destroyed only when the
          Recordkeepor of that Currency receives a notice from the
          owner of one or more units of that Currency, specifying the
          units to be destroyed.  The Recordkeepor shall note this
          destruction on eir records.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever an entity becomes indebted to another for some
          amount of Currency, that entity indebted is required to
          transfer that amount of Currency to the entity indebted to
          within seven days.

      (b) A debt not paid within seven days is overdue.  Any entity to
          whom an overdue debt is due may assess a late penalty of not
          more than 25% of the overdue debt, and may do so repeatedly,
          not more than once every seven days after the debt becomes
          overdue.  Late penalties are added to the overdue debt.  An
          entity may elect to charge smaller late penalties, charge
          them less frequently, or forego late penalties altogether,
          at that entity's sole discretion.

      (c) If the validity of a debt, or any part thereof, is disputed
          by a Call for Judgement, that debt (or portion thereof) is
          not considered overdue, and does not accrue late penalties,
          while the dispute remains unsettled.

      (d) When an entity transfers units of Currency to another entity
          for the purpose of making a payment on debt, the receiving
          entity shall apply that payment to the nondisputed debts
          owed to em by the transferring entity, in order from oldest
          to newest.  A debt is paid when a transfer has been applied
          to it in this manner.  Any surplus will be retained by the
          receiving entity, to be applied to future debts or returned
          upon demand.

      (e) An entity may assume that any Currencies transferred to it to
          be payments on debts due to em, unless the transferree
          clearly indicates otherwise when making the transfer.

      (f) An entity who is owed an overdue debt may issue an Order
          requiring the entity who owes that debt to make payment by
          requiring a transfer of any amount up to the amount of the
          debt due, but only if no other Order currently in force
          requires the same entity to make payment on that same debt
          or any part thereof.  Such an Order shall be stayed (by the
          Clerk of the Courts) if the debt in question is subsequently
          disputed, and vacated (by the Judge) if it is found that the
          debt upon which the Order is based is invalid.

      (g) An entity who is owed a debt may cancel all or part of that
          debt at any time.

      (h) A Judge may enjoin the assessment of late penalties,
          restrict the amount of late penalties, or require the
          reduction or cancellation of a debt, by Judicial Order, when
          the Rules specifically so allow.

         [Note: This Rule allows for an entity to maintain a running
          account balance instead of tracking individual payments, if
          the entity so desires.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1479 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to pay out some
          quantity of Currency to some entity, that Officer shall
          execute a Notice of Debt for the given amount with that
          entity as payee and the Bank as payor.

      (b) Whenever a Rule calls for an Officer to bill an entity for
          some quantity of Currency, that Officer shall execute a
          Notice of Debt for the given amount with that entity as
          payor and the Bank as payee.

      (c) A Notice of Debt is executed by announcing in the Public
          Forum that the payor is indebted to the payee for
          the amount indicated, so long as the announcement sets for
          the reason therefore.

      (d) The lawful execution of a Notice of Debt causes the payor
          noted therein to be indebted to the payee noted therein for
          the amount noted therein, but only if the executor of the
          Notice of Debt was authorized to execute it, and the reason
          set forth therein is correct.

      (e) The duties required of Officers by this Rule shall be
          performed as soon as possible after they arise.

      (f) For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      (a) The Recordkeepor of an intangible Currency is required to
          record every transfer for which e receives a transfer notice
          denominated in the Currency of which e is the recordkeepor,
          when:
        (1) the notice was sent by the transferring entity's Executor,
            or, for an entity which lacks an Executor, by any other
            person empowered by the Rules to execute transfers on the
            behalf of the transferring entity;
        (2) the notice clearly sets forth the quantity to be
            transferred in a form such that the Recordkeepor can
            easily and definitively determine the amount being
            transferred;
        (3) the entity to receive the transfer is specified with
            sufficient clarity that a reasonable person in the
            Recordkeepor's position would know to which entity the
            transferring entity refers; and
        (3) the transfer is for an amount not more than the current
            holdings of the transferring entity.

      (b) Transfers shall be noted on the Recordkeepor's records in
          the order in which they are received by the Recordkeepor.

      (c) When a Recordkeepor records a transfer, e shall promptly 
          inform the recipient of the transfer that the transfer has
          been recorded, unless it appears to the Recordkeepor that
          the recipient is already aware of the transfer.  

      (d) When a Recordkeepor elects not to record a transfer for the
          reason that the transfer is not in conformance with any part
          of subdivision (a) of this Rule, e shall promptly inform
          both the transferrer and the recipient that the transfer has
          not be recorded, and give the reason therefor.  (If the
          reason for failure to record is that the recipient was not
          clearly specified, there is no duty to inform the
          recipient.)

          determining how many Blots a Player has.

      (d) When a Rule states that a Player is to gain some number of
          Blots, a Notice of Debt shall be executed for the same

| 
[Probate]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      (a) Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have
          a Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that
          entity's Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) As soon as possible after the Notary announces the
          appointment of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, the
          following records shall be provided to the Trustee:
        (1) by the Recordkeepor of each Currency, an accounting of the
            number of units of that Currency held by the entity in
            Probate; and
        (2) by the Notary, any Will of the entity in Probate which has
            been filed with the Notary.

      (c) In the event that the Trustee does not receive any part of 
          the foregoing records within seven days, e may proceed as if
          the records would have indicated that the entity in Probate
          possessed no units of the appropriate Currency or did not
          have a Will, as appropriate to the type of records not
          received.

      (d) During the seven days immediately following the Trustee's
          appointment, e shall make a diligent effort to determine all
          debts due to the entity in Probate.

      (e) Any entity who is owed a debt by the entity in Probate must
          inform the Trustee of that debt within seven days of the
          Trustee's appointment; any debt not reported to the Trustee
          within that time is deemed cancelled.

      (f) If any of the debts of or due to the entity in Probate is
          disputed, the Trustee shall not develop a Plan for the
          disposition of the estate of the entity in Probate until
          after all such dispute are settled, and in no case shall e
          do so until the expiration of the time allowed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule.

      (g) As soon as possible after the time permitted to proceed by
          subdivision (e) of this Rule, the Trustee shall formulate
          and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition
          of the estate of the entity in Probate according to the
          provisions of the Probate Code.

      (h) If no objection to a Plan formulated pursuant to subdivision
          (g) of this Rule is posted in the Public Forum during a
          waiting period of seven days following its announcement, the
          Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the expiration of
          this waiting period, perform whatever steps are necessary to
          implement the Plan for disposition.

      (i) If an objection (other than an objection previously
          adjudicated to lack foundation) is made, the Trustee shall,
          as soon as possible after the objection was made, either:
        (1) discard the current Plan, and formulate and announce a new
            Plan; or
        (2) make a Call for Judgment alleging that the objection lacks
            foundation.

      (j) If a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a Trustee's
          Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
          formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until
          the CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
          foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that
          objection had never been made, and any attempt to announce
          that same objection again shall be disregarded.

      (k) An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it 
          correctly alleges that:
        (1) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
            of the Probate Code; 
        (2) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate; 
        (3) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
            substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity
            in Probate; or
        (4) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
            entity in Probate. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is dissolute if it:
        (1) possesses any number of Units of Currency, or owes or is
            owed a debt; and 
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary shall place in Probate any dissolute entity which
          is not already in Probate, as soon as possible as e becomes
          aware of the dissolute entity.

      (c) A dissolute entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence for as long as is necessary to complete its
          Probate (and thereby cease to be dissolute), even if it
          is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise would cease to have
          legal existence prior to that time.  An entity which has
          legal existence solely to this subdivision is called
          "terminal".

      (d) The following definitions apply with respect to entities in 
          Probate:
        (1) Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
            along with all debts owed to the entity in Probate.
        (2) Liabilities: all debts owed by the entity in Probate.
        (3) Creditor: any entity which is the payee of a debt owed by
            the entity in Probate.
        (4) Debtor: any entity which is the payor of a debt owed to
            the entity in Probate.
        (5) Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
            Probate.
        (6) Estate: the combined assets and liabilities of the entity
            in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      (a) The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
          Probate shall be constructed as detailed below.
        (1) The Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst its
            creditors, assigned to each creditor assets equal to the
            amount due that creditor, if it is possible to do so for
            all creditors, or a pro-rata portion otherwise.  
        (2) If the entity is terminal, and has a Will, the assets
            remaining after all creditors have been assigned their
            shares shall be divided as specified in the Will of the
            entity in Probate.  Any surplus remaining after the
            explicit provisions of the Will are applied shall be
            divided amongst the heirs in a manner consistent with the
            Will.
        (3) Any units of Currency remaining in the estate at this
            point shall be assigned to the Bank.

Since the addresses are completely different, you will get duplicate
copies. Sometimes, majordomo seems smart enough to figure out that
variations of addresses are actually the same address and doesn't
duplicate them (perhaps Oerjan can tell me the circumstances under which
this will be true), but I doubt that will be the case here.
