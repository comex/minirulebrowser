Protoproposal Chaos46 [rev. 4]

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a 
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
          (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
              three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
              Appeal; and 
          (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
              Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
              Players selected under subparagraph (1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.  A dismissal of this nature is without prejudice.

While you're tweaking the Appeal Rules, why not add an amendment that
Justices cannot serve as Judges when a CFJ is re-assigned.

I understand that - that's why it has to be the RK that issues the
order. But if the original PO has been satisfied, and a reversing order
is being issued, what does performing the vacation in addition actually
achieve?

Because a Vacating Officer may not have knowledge as to whether the PO
in question has been satisfied.  The Recordkeepor necessarily does,
however.

Yes, presently. Would anything be lost if the requirement to vacate the
PO were simply dropped?
