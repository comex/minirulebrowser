Or redefining Quorum to count anyone who had, at any time during the

While I do not dispute the legality of your other moves, you may not
change your Hold status in this way.  In particular, as you last went
on Hold less than 96 hours ago, you may not come off Hold as
requested.  (See R1016.)

Anyhow, could people please send me the latest proposals?

You should probably know that I just returned an Apellate Judgement

I am not qualified, as Cartographor, to give an official answer to 
that - Michael is. ;) 

However, as I understand Rule 1016, Swann did not succeed in going
Off Hold, since e was not authorized to move from the Stasis Chamber
on eir own behalf. This probably means that Swann's recent Votes
were not legal.

The first judge's argument that Harlequin wasn't really Antimatter's
EiP is false because it overlooks the last paragraph of 1601. 

The appeal judgement therefore has to focus on the question whether
Harlequin has performed eir duties in a "timely" manner as required by
1738.

However, "timely" is not defined precisely anywhere, and is thus open
to judicial interpretation. I will have to try and help develope a
sensible precedent in this judgement.


1. Which time span should be considered to determine the timeliness of
actions?

The rules do define "as soon as possible" as a possible timing
requirement, of one week. Clearly, "timely" is a more loose
requirement than ASAP, so the time allowed must be significantly more
than one week. 

Therefore, as far as Harlequin's EiP-ship of Morendil is concerned, e
certainly didn't violate 1738.

Other time delays implemented in the rules are from 96 hours (delay
between going on hold and off hold again, 1016) up to one month
(necessary delay before reregistering after being declared lawless,
1714). The time scale on which the game is proceeding is therefore one
of several weeks. The rules usually give players about one week
(delivering judgement) to 10 days (voting period) to perform tasks
that players usually want to perform, but can decline or ignore if
they want. "Timely", as a requirement clearly meant to be more loose
than other requirements in the rules, should therefore be interpreted
as a reference to a time of several weeks, possibly but not
necessarily up to two months.

This also makes sense in the issue at hand: while the EiP-ship can
also be declined (the EiP can resign from this duty, 1738), one may at
least give a newly appointed EiP some weeks to assess the situation of
the estate in probate and perform eir duties as required - or find out
that this is too much work for em, and resign as a consequence.

Of course, this CFJ concerns a time span of about two months (this is
how long Harlequin was EiP of Antimatter when this CFJ was made),
which is just a borderline case - had it been 3 or 4 weeks, or 3
months, the decision would have been easier.

Even if the time scale associated with the "timely" requirement is
fixed as "several weeks to two months", of course 1738 cannot be
interpreted as a requirement to _complete_ the termination of the
estate in probate in this time: there may be longwinded affairs of
disputed POs, unclear situations and, possibly, corresponding CFJs
involved. However, 1738 may safely be interpreted as the requirement
to _begin_ with the termination of the estate within such a time
frame.


2. The second question therefore is, did Harlequin make reasonable
attempts to perform eir duties according to 1738?

This is where, in this judge's opinion and within eir horizon, this
CFJ covers new ground in Agora's judicial history: In other judgements
all I need to be able to judge is a short description of the situation
and the rules. The issues normally are ones of rule interpretation.

The present case is more concerned with an assessment of a players
behavior, not a rules interpretation. Here, I'd really like to give
the accused a chance to defend emself and explain why e didn't do
anything visible to start doing eir job as EiP, and whether e did do
some things I just missed or never became aware of. However, with
Harlequin on hold and the limited time I have available for delivering
my judgement, I can not give Harlequin this chance the way I'd really
like to. [Side note: Maybe for "criminal cases" like this a different
procedure would be appropriate, with enough time and, possibly, more
detailed procedures for hearing both sides of the case.]

>From the information I have available, and the silence of the accused
so far, I would tend to judge true, assuming that Harlequin did not
even begin to do eir duties (or resign eir EiP-ship) within the two
months after eir assignment.

However, 1575 prescribes a very high standard of certainty required to
judge a CFJ as the present one TRUE. Because the time frame in
question is so close to the borderline of what I would call "timely",
and because I feel that the evidence available to me may not be quite
complete, I cannot judge this CFJ TRUE.


Although for different reasons, I therefore sustain the original
judgement of FALSE by elJefe.

You misunderstand me completely. The definition of Officer in 1006 is
fine. But just because a Rule uses it in passing doesn't impose
any reuirement. To say "I go On Hold iff the Officer who is my executor
gives permission" is NOT the same as "I go On Hold iff my executor is
an Officer AND he gives permission." The first ASSUMES that my executor
is an Officer. Now, the first message is confusing if my executor
indeed holds no Office, although I'd be open to reasoning that it
would apply to them anyway. But if they are a player who could reasonably
be called "an Officer", say THEY HOLD AN OFFICE, then I don't think
I have any problem in applying it to them. At worst, the sentence
is meaningless (which in this situation would mean that Morendil's
status is indeterminate).

Ah... well, I was unsure whether being on hold would cause problems with
cancelling my votes.  If it doesn't, then I'm not worried, so moving off
hold fails, that's fine...

I'm tempted to construe cancelling one's votes as a form of casting
Votes and say that being on hold bars you from doing that as well.

Cancelling a deferred trasnfer order, on the other hand, is not
barred.

I'll look into the situation more closely before releasing the
results.

I wouldn't go that far.  This case is one of statutory construction,
and when attempting to construe a statute, and more particularily, a
term used in a statute, one must necessarily look at how that term is
used in other statutes.

As far as the appeal being frivilous, I should remind you that
reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the interpretation of
a statute.  You espouse a particular construction of this statute
without elaborating on how you reached that construction.  Your
determination that Officer should be read in the sense of "person
holding an Office" violates the canon of statutory construction I just
mentioned, and your failure to identify or promulgate another canon
(other than your "least violence" rule, which I feel is not
sufficiently specified to be probatively useful, nor do I agree that
your construction necessarily "does the least violence" to the Rule)
which justifies this violation is my main reason for seeking appellate
review.

There is IMHO a good reason why construing "Officer" as "person who
holds an Office" is both valid and useful, and that is precisely the low
precedence of the provision which attempts to restrict the range of
persons qualified to hold an Office to registered Players; it is this
particular
resolution of precedence between that provision and the one in 790 that
installs the Winner of an Election into an Office that resulted in the
situation
which is the proximal reason for the claim that the Speaker is currently
Tainted, based on indirect reasoning from the definition of a Tainted
Speaker
as one who came into that position from an Office of the Speaker-Elect
not held "in the normal fashion", again indirectly based on the definition
of
_that_ phrase as "an Office to which an Officer has been Elected".

I therefore tend toward the position that either a non-Player cannot hold
Office, or a non-Player who does so is an Officer, but the middle ground
does not appear a very comfortable place to be.

Of course, if I were to decide in favor of the former interpretation, we
would
have a pretty paradox - I would have to return, as Speaker, a decision
implying
that I am not Speaker.

There is some merit in Zefram's observation that R869 says that a
Player is a person who is registered as a Player. That might be
taken to indicate that if one becomes a Player, via whatever means,
that one is also registered.

You cannot come Off Hold until 96 hours have passed since you went On Hold.

That won't work. It'll just intensify the race condition already inherent
in Public Voting: everybody'll try not to vote until the last minute,
so they can see what everyone else is doing. Better just to lower Quorum,
I think. Quorum is effectively 50% at the moment, and that's probably
too high, if you think about it. Quorum of 1/3 would be more realistic
in my opinion.

In A Huff, it seems. Although not a Huff and grandiose and operatic as
Zefram's. But that was positively Wagnerian, and a hard act to follow.
