Alright, you've convinced me: R1079 does contain a minor flaw in that it
doesn't require a person making two choices simultaneously to make them
independently of each other.

Tip: If you have a DOS machine with Windows 95, loading a text file 
in MS-DOS Edit and saving it will convert all the tabs to spaces.

Tip: Don't use MS-DOS edit to edit makefiles, or anything else that 
needs real tabs :-)

Thank you !
I have used this suggestion to get the revised report out.  I will work
on improving the format more, but I believe this will help some.

I just read the paper, which is called "The Uneven Distribution of
Numbers in Nature", by L. Pietronero, E. Tosatti, V. Tosatti and A.
Vespigniani. Like the Ley paper I mentioned, it begins with a discussion
of Benford (1938). Unlike the Ley paper, which merely observes that US
Stock Prices indices follow Benford's Law, Pietronero et. al. actually
explain Benford's Law as a feature of scale invariance in natural
phenomena, something which mathematics is still only newly investigating
as part of the burgeoning research effort in non-linear dynamics.

Pietronero et. al. consider my hypothesis that Benford's Law is the
result of choice of unit, but reject it because the phenomenon does not
disappear if a different unit is chosen. This is the clue that scale
invariance is involved in the explanation of Benford's Law.

I have taken care of this and 13 others for various Players.  The

On Aug. 1 you had .1 VT according to Blob's report.  You made the
transfer on Aug 3.  Did i miss a transfer from the bank in that time?

It was listed twice, but not accounted twice due to my method of
calculation.  I can provide the spread sheet.

In your summary you have me with a debt of 6, but I can only find
4 VTs worth of oustanding POs. And wasn't VT2787 one of the duplicated
POs you said you'd gotten rid of?

I notice from the above line and similar ones in other messages that
Proglet's mail program apparently has a bug that causes it to believe that
the owner address of the list (which is the From envelope and Sender:
header of messages from the list) is the address of the author (rather
than the From: header) - it is not much of a stretch to guess that it also
thinks that this is the right place to reply to (rather than the Reply-To:
header.)

Changing to a mail program that properly understands Internet mail headers
seems in order.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

That's an interesting point which I hadn't considered. Perhaps you
should make a CFJ?

Steve, when are you going to learn how to use majordomo to approve
such messages, instead of forwarding them?

I'd remind people that I'm usually happy to add unofficial annotations
on request.  However, a request usually is needed--I can't always
look in detail at every CFJ to see if an unofficial annotation
is warranted.  Of course, the unofficial annotation doesn't carry
the legal weight that an official one does, but if the purpose
is only to remind us of previous relevant judgements, it should
be good enough.  Oh, also I can be forced to add an official
annotation whether I want to or not.  Unofficial annotations must
meet with my approval. :)

Which leads to another feature of unofficial annotations, and
one which cuts both ways--that is, official annotations consist
essentially of the statement of the CFJ, which may not adequately
represent the central issue of the CFJ.  CFJ 790 is a good example:
if R1079 were annotated with simply the statement of the CFJ--that
a certain office was vacant (a statement which itself was judged
UNKNOWN!), it would provide no indication of what the central
issue of that CFJ was.  On the other hand, an unofficial annotation
can address the central issue of a CFJ even if that issue is
not clear from the statement of the CFJ.  The danger there, of course,
is that the unofficial annotation may be inaccurate.  In fact, Scott
convinced me not too long ago to remove an unofficial annotation
regarding the effective time of messages, on the grounds that my
annotation was in fact broader than the Judge's reasoning in the CFJ.

Back to the requests for unofficial annotations, it would help,
when you're requesting an unofficial annotation, if you would
have a suggested annotation for me.  In the present case, it's
easy enough for me to come up with an annotation for R1837 (which
I'll do), but it's difficult for me to see what, if any, annotation
would be appropriate for R1079 based on CFJ 790.  "A selection made
from two choices by taking the number of ingredients on a cereal
box, modulo two, might not be random" seems too narrow to be useful,
but I can't see offhand any broader annotation that would be warranted
by the Judgement.  Steve, if you can come up with a useful annotation
that's warranted by the judgement, I'll include it, but I'm not sure
there is such a beast.  I remind you that 1) the judgement in CFJ 790
was UNKNOWN, not TRUE; and 2) R1079 has changed since CFJ 790,
particularly in regards to where the burden of proof lies if
the randomness of a method is challenged.

I know how to do that, and I've been doing it routinely for months.
Every message you see with the "this message was trapped by majordomo"
note on it has been sent on using majordomo's approval script.

Proglet's message was an exception; it was not trapped in the manner of
other messages but was actually sent to me as the list-owner. So it
didn't contain the normal headers which the approve script relies on.
Maybe the approve script would have worked anyway; if it happens again,
I'll try it.

Ok, I've tried using findmail, and as you say, the last two seem not to
work. The agora-official archives are working and I poked around them.
Findmail has some neat features! Unfortunately, the message I'm looking
for was probably posted on August 8, and the findmail archives don't go
back that far. So here's my query:

It's a Bank Transaction notice from Michael Norrish, posted to
agora-official on or about August 8. It should have the string "Bank
Transaction" in the Subject line. Hope that's enough for you to find it,

The relevant POs would be in a message labelled "official salaries".
The corresponding TOs should be in a "Bank transactions" message, but
probably, in fact, have not been made. As Chancellor, Michael seems to 
wait for the relevant recordkeepor to report a PO, before posting the
corresponding TO. So no salary POs have been filled for several weeks.

Hm. If it is true that Michael has been issuing Payment Orders for
Salaries (as Registrar), but failing to make the corresponding Transfer
orders (as Chancellor), then Michael must be guilty of Persisent
Indebtedness, since, in the language of R1713 (Debt), he is not On Hold
and is

      the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming it
      as Payor...

On the other hand, if Michael has not been issuing the Salary POs, then
he would be guilty of violating R1599 (Failure to Execute Payment
Orders).

But it still seems to me that I have seen transfers from the Bank
satisfying Salary POs in the last few weeks, even though I can't seem to
locate any of the messages. Obviously Michael is the person in the best
position to settle all this.
