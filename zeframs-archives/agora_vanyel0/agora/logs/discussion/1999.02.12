Clearly that's a hangover form the time when Proposals were given their
Numbers when they reached the Queue instead of when they are distributed
to be voted upon. It should be removed.

Er, Jeff, I quote your Judgement:

      Note that this does not mean that there are two Proposals; under
      1483 there was no creation of any new Proposal with the same text.

I don't think you can claim to have been silent on the issue, Jeff. The
above remark carries with it the clear implication that Scott's second
message did not have the effect of distributing a second Proposal.

I agree with you about Presence, or at least free Presence. I hate it.
It is death to any economy based on voting. The idea of paying for
voting is that you have to pay to have an influence on the game. But
declaring presence for the purposes of ensuring a Proposal makes Quorum
has a substantial influence on the game. Therefore, precisely the same
arguments that were raised against Zefram when he argued that voting
should be free apply equally well to declaring Presence. It should not
be free, either. Since we already have a separate concept of abstention
which costs VTs, we should just get rid of Presnece altogether.

My proposed solution is different though. I'd like to see compulsory
Proposing and compulsory voting (at least on one Proposal a week).

I should stop talking about an economy, since it's leading people
astray. I'm not interested in economic simulation. I'm interested in
designing a good, well balanced political game with interesting tactical
and strategic decisions about the allocations of one's various
resources, both tangible (eg, Currencies) and intangible (eg the regard
in which others hold you).

Protoproposal Chaos143 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1786

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1786 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
          margins when:
        (1) the Proposal has met the requirements established by other
            Rules to be considered passed;
        (2) the Proposal would not have passed, would not have met
            Quorum, or both, had there been one fewer Vote cast FOR on
            it; and
        (3) at least one Vote was cast AGAINST against it.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
          have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall
          pay out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three)
          Voting Tokens in addition to any other award that Player
          might also receive for the passing of that Proposal.

IMO, there is no justification for regarding those two distributions
as the same Proposal. The only part of 1483 that refers specifically
to the Promotor is the following:

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

That clearly doesn't apply here. Now, let's look at the rest of this
rule.


      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

The first paragraph refers to how a Proposal is made. G. Chaos
is obviously not the Proposing Entity here. Does the second
paragraph apply? I don't think so. The last sentence is
clearly still referring to Proposing Entities, which as we
said doesn't apply. The 'delivery' referred to in the first sentence
is (upon the most obvious interpretation) referring to the same
'delivery' that paragraph one is talking about, namely, the delivery
of a collection of text to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity.
Again, this doesn't apply to the Promotor. The only protection the
Promotor receives is in paragraph three, the only one that
specifically refers to him. Is it me that is "deeply confused", or the
Rule?

Good example, but I'd still call that an unintended secondary effect.
It doesn't affect the structure of the game (rules, pieces, etc.) I
might counter with a situation in which we are playing on a cheap
set, and we find that the 'en passant' rule was left out of little
booklet that came with it. Surely there is no sense in playing
without it, since we 'know what the rules are'. 
  Let's abandon the chess analogy and consider the following Rule

Rule 11:

No Chromatic Repeals shall be permitted.


In Agora, this rule would probably be deemed to have little
effect. But I consider its intent, and meaning, plain, at least
to a degree. Would it prohibit a Proposal to repeal every Rule
but one? I can imagine an extension of interpretation to cover
such an event. Over time, a consensus would develop. Perhaps
we would decide that any attempt to repeal 50% or more or the
Rule is a Chromatic repeal. Some would argue based on utility,
some on the author's intent, some on historical precedent. Such
would be more fun, IMHO, than sticking to the text above all.

Perhaps the fact that I am in Classical archaeology which requires
at times that I come up with ingenious (but reasonable)
interpretations of confused or incomplete texts by considering such
matters as intent that makes me desire to treat the Rules in the
same way. G. Chaos appears to view the Rule as a legal code. Anyone
else want to put up their view? It might make an interesting thesis.

Of course I understand that. But VTs aren't a commodity, the
right to vote is. VTs are a currency that can be traded for the
right to vote. And I don't propose fixed conversion rates. We could,
for example, auction off VTs and P-Notes. Or we could automate
it by making the price proportional to the amount of the commodity
in circulation. And its possible to have too few commodities to make
barter feasible. Right now, most everyone has more P-Notes than
they'd like, and fewer VTs. That isn't very conducive to barter.

Sure. Remember, this is based on Monopoly. Start small, I always say.

True. It might be interesting if we could use P-Notes to _lower_
the Priority of a Proposal. Then we'd have more control over
the distribution rate (although other Players may have different
ideas.

As a spur to investment. Remember, the hypothetical goal is an
economy that's at least as realistic as Monopoly.

It carries a clear indication that the second message did not distribute
a *new* proposal, but it *is* silent as to whether the second

I don't think we're there yet. The only thing of significant value
to most Players is VTs. Your division of labor idea is good. Here's
another one (maybe): have three flavors of VTs: Red, White and Blue
(being parochial for a minute here). Red VTs can only be used on
Proposals numbered 3n, Blue on those numbered 3n+1, and Blue on
those numbered 3n+2. Double salaries, but Players can only get paid
in one color of VT. Then we'd have trading. (yes, I know, this
violates my manifesto. I contradict myself? Very well, I contradict
myself. I am large, I contain multitudes).

You speak of an exceptional instance. If this were common, I wouldn't
have a complaint. But we have to wade through lots of "bad" mutations
before we hit upon one that's useful. As I said, Summary Adoption
is a good solution. In the case you mention, any such Proposal would
have failed. In the case of the great disappearing Kudo fiasco, that
might have taken less than three months to fix. Frankly, I'd pay
almost any price for G. Chaos not to have to go through official
channels to get his reformatting proposals through. Consider this:
If we made adopting G. Chaos' formatting proposals our only priority,
under current rules, how long before we got through them all? At least
a year, I'd say. Half the  proposals are typo fixes (or the
equivalent), half of the rest are interesting proposals doomed by
tiny flaws. It just seems so inefficient.

Protoproposal Chaos160 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1565

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1565 be amended to read:

      (a) A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if:
        (1) it contains no clearly-identifiable Statement;
        (2) its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
            or FALSE;
        (3) its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
            Rules;
        (4) its Statement fails to comply with the Rules;
        (5) it lacks standing, as defined elsewhere; or
        (6) after a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
            relevant information, no determination can be made of the
            truth or falsity of its Statement.

      (b) The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
          dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are
          only legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule. 
          Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
          dismissal.

      (c) As soon as possible after being notified of a legal
          dismissal, the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice
          of the dismissal and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      (d) If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside,
          then that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered
          again and can not again be legally dismissed for the same
          reasons.

      (e) A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
          deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

You might wish to note that Present is not a Vote except for the purpose
of Quorum.  Otherwise the above would have failed, since it is not
currently legal to change a Vote (although you may add further Votes.)

Greetings,

The rules you quote above all refer to the act of *making* or creating
proposals.  It's clear from those Rules that there has never been more
than one Proposal with the title and text you sent to the Promotor.  It
is also clear from R1770 that Scott's first message succeeded in
distributing that proposal, but without a legitimate Proposal number.

    "The Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
     Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
     its Proposing Entity.

     The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
     accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
     distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect."

The Rules are completely silent about what happens when the Promotor
tries to make another distribution of a proposal which has already
been distributed.  IMO, common sense would dictate that any subsequent
"distribution" of a distributed Proposal is without legal significance.
I agree with elJefe that eir judgement is as silent as the Rules on
this issue.  The way I read eir judgement, Scott's second message
attempted to do two things; assign a proposal number to Vlad's proposal
and to distribute that proposal.  elJefe contends, and I'm inclined
to agree, that the R109 obligation to assign a number to that proposal
was still in effect, and that Scott's second message fulfilled that
obligation, regardless of the consequences of the attempted second
distribution.

?? I don't see how this follows. 1483 says that if I post a Proposal
teice, that isn't two proposals. I don't see the connection to
the Promotor.

I think this is a perfect example of why we *should* give greater
weight to the letter of the Rule than the actual intent.   Those
of us without your historical perspective would have no idea
what a "Chromatic Repeal" was unless it was defined in the
Rules.  New players would have to discover the meaning of
this rule by finding out the consensus of the other Players
as to that definition.  And they would be at a distinct disadvantage
until they succeeded in this discovery.  I think it's a good thing
that Agora strives to have all information you need to play contained
within the Rules and official reports.

Somewhere in between, I imagine, but probably closer to G. Chaos.
It is not my crusade to eliminate all ambiguity from the Rules, but I
think the Rules should be complete, in the sense that all terms should
be defined.  I think I've had the most fun when it comes as a surprise
that someone has a different interpretation of a Rule than I did and then
we get to argue (discuss) about who's interpretation is more correct or
better for the game.

Of course, these discussions about differing philosophical outlooks
towards Agora are also fun.  I hope you are finding that to be true,
as well. 8)

Protoproposal Chaos165 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1365

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1365 be amended to read:

      (a) There shall exist a type of Application called an
          Application to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if
          effective, has the effect of annotating a Judgement or
          Dismissal in a given Call for Judgement. In order for such
          an Application to have effect upon Execution, it must:
        (1) clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.;
        (2) be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting
            Opinion;
        (3) indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to which it
            applies is that of the Judge or that of the Appeals Court;
        (4) be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which may
            include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations of
            deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom;
        (5) bear the Signatures of at least two Players; and
        (6) be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
            Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later
            than one week after the publication by the Clerk of the
            Courts of that Judgement or Dismissal.

      (b) An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by
          submitting it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an
          Application, having been Executed and having met all the
          requirements for effectiveness, is also called an Opinion. 
          It is also referred to as a Concurring Opinion or a
          Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the Opinion.

      (c) Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and
          takes effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the
          Opinion to all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore,
          the Opinion must be appended to the Legal Judgement or
          Dismissal.

Then again, it's impossible for the Rules to be self-sufficient, if 
only because the meaning of the Rules is dependent on principles
of constructions of these same Rules which are as much a part of the 
Agoran culture as the meaning of 'Chromatic Repeals' is.

Not me!  I have used up my last P-Note in getting a Proposal onto the
Queue.  If it doesn't get distributed within a month, its Priority
will drop to zero, and then it will likely be culled by the Promotor.
My investment will have had zero return, and won't even had had a
chance to produce any return.  

I could do with an extra P-Note to push its priority even higher, but
that would in a sense be self-defeating because I would have then
spent two P-Notes in order to (possibly) get two back.

Still, better to remain in the same financial position, and have my
proposal adopted than to lose a P-Note and not ever have the Proposal
see the light of day.

Would one of those P-Note rich Players care to sell me a P-Note?  I
can perhaps offer 1 or 2 VTs.  (I will need some in reserve to pay for
a vote on the proposal itself.)

This "game within a game" of proposal sponsorship is certainly a
difficult one for the poverty-stricken.  As they say, it takes money
to make money.

Hmm.  We seem to be having trouble communicating here and
I can't figure out what the misunderstanding is.  There isn't
a connection to the Promotor here, other than the fact that
you have to send the proposal text to em in order to create
the official Proposal.  And 1483 says that if you send it to em more
than once (within a short time period) it is still only one
Proposal.   You are correct when you point out that this
provision isn't relevant to the current situation.  My point here
was that there has only ever been *one* proposal for the Grand
Agoran Tournament, whatever Scott may have done as Promotor
with that Proposal.

I agree that there are underlying principles of Rule construction
and interpretation that are part of an Agoran culture.  But the Rules are
written in a way that anyone, regardless of cultural knowledge, could
interpret in a reasonable, non-arbitrary way.  This is significantly
different from a term like "Chromatic Repeals" which has no meaning

kBut a "return" on your investment is only important if you
want to make an ever increasing amount of proposals. If your
(distribution rate) * (adoption rate) is greater or equal than
50%, you will break even, which is fine if you only want to
make a few proposals per month.

What I am trying to get you to do is answer the question
"Why didn't the second distribution create a second proposal?"
Note that this second proposal would still have been "made"
by me, but would have been 'created' by G. Chaos, perhaps,
perhaps out of thin air. If you take an Aristotelian view of
causation that's fine. Note that we are talking about the
creation of a second proposal in an ontological sense, not
the "having been made" sense of 1483. In other words, 
1483 doesn't regulate unintended duplication of a Proposal
by the Promotor. Once I have posted it and its in the queue,
its out of my hands. I "made" it, but 1483 doesn't prevent the
creation, spontaneous or otherwise, of duplicates.
  Now the answer is "it's common sense that a second
distribution doesn't "twin" the proposal". Then the next
question is, if common sense is sufficient to give us no
doubt that the second distribution didn't duplicate the
proposal, why isn't common sense enough to give us no 
doubt that a second posting by the Proposer doesn't
create a second proposal? Why is the second paragraph
of 1483 necessary at all?
  To continue the debate, I suppose G. Chaos would then
pipe up and say that the Promotor qua Promotor doesn't have agency to
create Proposals, that e merely distributes them, while
Players qua Players do have agency to create Proposals. Still,
I don't think that entirely clears up the ontological issue.
How do we tell when two Nomic Entities are actually the same
thing. If an Officer publishes an Official Report, and then
publishes the same Report the next day as an official report,
is it the same or a different official report? Different,
common sense tells us. But if that Official Publication is
the text of a Proposal to be distributed, we assume it is the
same. So it seems as if we have a general law:

If a Player attempts to perform two identical actions, those
actions are to be considered two actions if e has agency to
perform them, unless e specifically identifies them as
the same action, and one action if e does not have agency
or e does so specify.

Any comments?

What about the habitual use of the Spivak pronouns?

I found a bunch of old Agora mail that has been sitting in my
accout for a while. Some of it is interesting. The first
is a tribute to Scott for posting my APPLE proposal.

Subject: quasiproto

as i've previously insinuated, i've been working on rebuilding the
judicial system.  what follows is part of what i've written so far.
this doesn't yet cover appeals, salaries, eligible and ineligible
judges, legal reasons for dismissal, or injunctions.

comments appreciated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      There shall exist an Office with the general responsibility for
      the administration of the judicial process, as described
      elsewhere.  This Office shall be known as the Clerk of the
      Courts.

      The Salary of the Clerk of the Courts shall be five Points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      There shall exist an Office with the duty of Judging various
      matters of law, when the Rules so require.  This Office shall be
      known as the Justiciar.

      The Salary of the Justiciar shall be two Points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Player who seeks formal resolution of a dispute or
      disagreement shall request such by submitting a Call for
      Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts.  Any document submitted to
      the Clerk of the Courts and which is clearly marked as a Call
      for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a Call for Judgement not
      later than the time e announces the identity of the first Judge
      assigned to Judge it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      Whenever it shall occur that there is a Call for Judgement for
      which has neither been Judged nor dismissed, and to which no
      Player who is eligible to Judge that CFJ has been assigned to
      Judge that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall, as soon as
      possible, randomly select a Judge to be assigned to Judge that
      CFJ as soon as possible after this condition becomes known to
      the Clerk of the Courts.

      The Clerk shall distribute the identity of a Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Call for Judgement must contain a single clearly-labeled
      Statement, which can be determined to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      If a Call for Judgement does not contain such a Statement, then
      the Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ, as described
      elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ except the Statement in formulating eir
      Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement must, within
      seven days of being assigned to Judge it, either return a
      Judgement upon that CFJ, or dismiss it.  However, if the Judge
      becomes ineligible to be Judge of that CFJ before this time
      period expires, e shall not be required to do either of these
      things.  

      If a Judge fails to either dismiss the CFJ or return a Judgement
      within the permitted time, e becomes ineligible to Judge that
      CFJ, and further commits an Infraction to be reported by the
      Clerk of the Courts.  The penalty for this infraction is three
      Blots.

      This Rule yields to any Rule which permits a longer period of
      deliberation; however, this Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would shorten the period of deliberation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Judge returns a Judgement by sending it to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A Judgement must be either TRUE or FALSE, and must be
      delivered to the Clerk not later than the end of the permitted
      time for deliberation.  A Judgement returned after the end of
      the permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to
      be Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by
      the Clerk.

      A CFJ has been Judged when a legal Judgement has been received
      by the Clerk.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Judge dismisses a CFJ by sending a message to the Clerk of the
      Courts so stating that e dismisses the CFJ, and detailing the
      reason for dismissal.  A dismissal returned after the end of the
      permitted deliberation period, or by a Player ineligible to be
      Judge of that CFJ is not legal and shall not be accepted by the
      Clerk.

      A Judge shall not dismiss a CFJ unless the Rules specifically
      permit it.

      A CFJ is dismissed when a legal dismissal has been received by
      the Clerk; however, if the dismissal is set aside, then that CFJ
      is no longer dismissed and shall be considered again.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal dismissal, the
      Clerk shall distribute the notice of dismissal and the Judge's
      reason for dismissal to the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      If a CFJ has been dismissed, and further any three Players have
      insisted upon it, an Appeal of that dismissal shall be
      initiated, with the question of the Appeal being whether or not
      the dismissal was justified.  If the Appeal determines that the
      dismissal was not justified, then the dismissal shall be set
      aside.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      A Player is permitted to make eirself ineligible to Judge a
      specific CFJ by notifying the Clerk of the Courts of this
      desire.  A Player who does so shall lose two Points; this Point
      Transfer shall be reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Interesting to examine this old debate. Having had time to
think about it, I've come back to my old theory that
101 defines (in a way) what it is to be a Player. Consider:
what need is there to define Players at all? I can easily
see a Nomic in which anyone can Propose, Vote, CFJ (as now),
own currencies. Of course you'd have to modify the Registrar's
report, the Unemplyment Rule, etc. (perhaps to include only
those people voting within the past month), but there
would be no problem. Except 101. There would be no way
to amend 101, you'd have to get rid of it.

Subject: Why 101 is important


Aaaargh. I still can't sleep. Now the 101
debate is plaguing me. Here is what I have
come up with:

As many have pointed out, 101 is an attempt to
codify a Metarule in the Rules. This is
very important. Any attempt to change or repeal
101 can legitimately be seen as an attempt to
change or repeal the Metarule. Of course, some
Players might accept such an attempt as valid,
while others wouldn't. The result would probably
be chaos. This is why Suber says players who repeal
101 get what they deserve.
  So far this only argues why we shouldn't get rid of it.
Why is it important? I feel 101 is important precisely
because it does codify a Metarule. I feel the unique
power of Nomic is that it blurs the distinction between
Rule and Metarule. Surely Metarules are subject to change?
What would be the distinction between changing the
Metarule and changing 101.
  This functional equivalence of Rule and Metarule may be
the best way to express my belief that Nomic is not a game.
And 101 brings that into the open. This service is enough,
IMO, to justify its preservation.

Vlad

Subject: Why 101 is important

I'd be interested in hearing somewhat more concretely about
your (Vlad) ideas on rules and metarules.  First off, I think
we use "metarule" in different ways: for me, a metarule is just
a Rule that's about Rules.  So 101 is a metarule, as are the
precedence Rules.  The Rules about (for instance) Kudos are
not metarules (they aren't about Rules).  When you say "metarule",
on the other hand, I have the feeling you mean something like
"a rule that we in fact observe, but isn't written down"?

>   But the real definition of a Rule is a communal Metarule
> which we have agreed upon (based on higher Metarules), which

That's true for a few Rules, but I don't think it can count as
a definition of "Rule"?  For instance, the Rules about Kudos,
or about the duties of the Ambassador, don't in any way I
can think of "Replace a personal Metarule" of mine.  I
certainly had no unwritten rules about Kudos and Ambassadors
before I came to Agora!

While the board-men-and-moves of chess don't have any
particularly meta flavor, tournament chess definitely
has things that I think fit your definition of metarules.
Things like the touch/adjust rules (if you touch a piece,
you have to move it, unless you said "I adjust" first),
rules about settling disputes, rules about which set
of board-men-and-moves rules are official, rules about
sneezing, smoking, shouting, and so on and so on.  And
these are written down, not just inchoate consensus.
I don't think that keeps tournament chess from counting
as a game; it just shows that in any significantly
complex game (including tournament chess and Agora,
but not casual woodpushers in a friendly chess game)
it's likely to become necessary to write down some
of the otherwise-unwritten rules (the things you call
metarules, only some of which I would call metarules).

Again, I'd be interested in hearing what implications
these ideas about written and unwritten rules have
for the actualy daily conduct of (say) Agora.  What
would we do differently?

A situation I very well know, and I can assure people that it's highly

Damn, I can't sleep. Why? Because I'm thinking of
Nomic, of course. So I get up and put my thoughts
on the net. Maybe some of the Aussies will be
around to reply.

Would the following Rule work?

Overturn Precedence (MI=1)

Attention! From now on, if two Rules conflict, the
one whose text (excluding Title) comes first in
alphabetical order has precedence, unless one
rules explicitly claims (or defers) precedence
over the other. If both claim (or defer) precedence,
the alphabetical method again governs? This Rule
takes precedence over all other Rules.

---------
Can this work? I'm sure this has been gone over before.
Does this have the power to overturn our current
precedence system?
  Upon further thought, maybe this is related to the
paradox of self-amendment, I don't know. I do know
that if it were passed with an MI=4 there'd be no
problem. Why should a new precedence Rule have to
satisfy the requirements of the old one? What if
it couldn't? Something to ponder......

I'm around and awake, Vlad. [It's a little before 6pm here.]

Hmmm...lessee...we stipulate a conflict between two Rules with the
same MI; we stipulate also that the numerical method and the
alphabetic method give different answers. So now 'Overturn
Precedence' and Rule 1030 are themselves in conflict...but guess
what? Only *one* of them claims precedence over the other - 'Overturn
Precedence'.  So, since Rule 1030 specifically says that explicit
precedence claims which are uncontested take precednece over the
numerical method, in *this* conflict, both precedence Rules get
the same answer: 'Overturn Precedence' has precedence. The only
problem lies in determining in virtue of which of the two precedence
Rules does 'Overturning Precedence' have the precedence it does?

But things turn nastier if we imagine adding a precedence clause
to Rule 1030 to protect it against just this kind of thing. Now
the conflict at level 0 (between the two hypothetical Rules) is
not only replicated at level 1 (between the two precedence Rules),
but this level 1 conflict immediately engenders a new level 2
conflict between the same Rules, which creates a level 3 conflict
between the same Rules, etc ad infinitum, with ne'er an actual
resolution of any of the precedence conflicts in sight. The only
way I can envision breaking such a deadlock is via a meta-game
agreement to just arbitrarily pick one of precedence Rules to
take precedence in setting precedences. Not a happy prospect.

Conclusion: *if* we take the threat of a Rule like 'Overturning
Precedence' being enacted seriously (but do we?), then we have a good
argument for upmutating Rule 1030 immediately to at least MI=3. And
if we were still worried about 'Overturning Precedence' being enacted
at MI=3, we could enact another Rule at MI=3 forbidding Rules like
'Overturning Precedence' from having any effects. 

Final note: this stuff is not as theoretical as you might think.
For consider this paragraph from the recently repealed Rule 
1460 (a similar paragraph appears in the proto "Definition
of the Powers"):

      In the case where the casting of two or more Powers has
      conflicting effects, the latest-cast Power shall have
      precedence. This method of resolving conflicts between Rules
      which define Powers shall take precedence over other methods
      for resolving conflicts between Rules more generally, as
      described in other Rules.

This effectiveness of this paragraph was never tested during
Rule 1460's brief existence, but I take it that the paragraph
*would* be effective for precisely the reasons outlined in
my first paragraph above, namely, that the paragraph uncontestedly
claims precedence over Rule 1030 in case the two conflict, and
so Rule 1030 by its own lights defers to it. Is this pernicious?
I see no reason to think so. Note also that strengthening the
precedence of Rule 1030 by adding a precedence clause to it
does *not* cause a vicious infinite spiral of unresolvable 
precedence claims, because this paragraph does not claim precedence
in resolving precedence disputes between it and other precedence-
settling Rules. It only tries to settle the way in which 
conflicts between the Powers get resolved. 

Thanks, Vlad! That was fun!

Hmmm... I guess that my thesis wasn't that original then...

Ok.  From R1483:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.

This has been a sticking point before, but I would say that Scott's second
message had a clear indication that it was intended to be a distribution
of an existing proposal, and therefore had a clear indication that it
was *not* intended to become a new proposal.  The above quoted text makes
it clear that Scott's second message did not bring about the creation
of a new Proposal.

Well, it depends on what you mean by "duplicate".  I tend
to take a somewhat Platonic view of what the Proposal is.
That is, the Proposal is the abstract entity to which the
collection of text refers and which is created as a result
of R1483.  There can certainly be duplicate copies of the
text, but moving those copies of text around cannot
create new versions of an abstract entity (new Proposal)
unless they are moved around in a way that the Rules say would
create such a new entity.

It's more than just common sense. There is a distinct difference
between the two actions wrt what legal significance the Rules
grant to those actions.  In the case of the distributor retristributing
the same proposal more than once, there is nothing in the Rules
that grants legal significance to that action.  In the case of
a Proposer sending the same text to the Promotor more than once
(each with a clear indication that it is intended to become a
Proposal), then the Rules *do* specify legal significance to
both actions, and without that second paragraph, the Promotor
would have to put all copies in the queue and we would have
to treat them as distinct Proposals.

In terms of your Report example, again it's more than just
common sense.  One of the properties of a Report is the time
of issue.  So even if both reports have the same text, it's
clear that they are different entities since they have
different properties.  Admittedly, this may not always be
so clear.

As to your general rule, I don't think I would put this in terms
of agency (although maybe what I say below amounts to the same thing).
I would say that the Rules specify what legal significance
each action has (is this what you mean by agency?).  So,
if a Player performs two identical actions, each of which
is defined to have some legal significance, then, unless
the Player indicates that e intended it to be one action,
we must regard it as two separate actions.  Actions taken by
Players which are not defined by the Rules to have legal
significance then do not have legal significance nor can they
create entities that do.

A pain in the butt, IMO, but their meaning can be determined
from context.

But the two seem to me to be special cases of the same rule. The
reason why we want to reject one is the same as why we want
to reject the other. The question is, what that reason is.

Well, one of the characteristics of a Proposal is its time
of distribution, as has been pointed out, so I'm not sure
this is the best explanation. Time of creation is a 
property of every Entity.

More or less the same as my formulation.

  Actions taken by

No? if I have a child, that child has legal significance 
because that child can CFJ while, for example, a ceramic
ashtray created by me cannot.

I think Steve misses the main point of the problem here: Even upmutating
the precedence rule to MI=3 (this was before 'half' of it actually was 
upmutated as the present rule 1482) would not solve this problem.

Suppose we have Rule 9999, which says

Rule 9999 (Power=1)
    In a conflict between two Rules, the Rule with the highest number
    takes precedence.

This Rule is in conflict with Rule 1482, because it claims that some Rules
take precedence over other Rules, whereas Rule 1482 claims the opposite.
Who wins this conflict? Rule 1482 says Rule 1482 does, Rule 9999 that Rule
9999 does. So they are in conflict. Who wins this conflict?...

Basically, if two Rules both claim precedence over one another, only other
rules can decide about their precedence.

Protoproposal Chaos166 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 911

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 911 be amended to read:

      (a) When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
          selected in order to reach a decision about the
          consideration mandated by the appeal.

      (b) A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players,
          called Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the
          Justices for each Board, as follows, until three eligible
          Justices have been selected; The Speaker is selected, if
          eligible; The Justiciar is selected, if eligible; The CotC
          is selected, if eligible; Any remaining positions are then
          filled by random selection, by the CotC, from all remaining
          eligible Players.

      (c) A Player is ineligible for selection if:
        (1) e has already been selected to serve on that Board;
        (2) e has been dismissed as Justice from that Board;
        (3) e has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider;
        (4) e was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
            matter under consideration when it was called, and this
            restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
            being selected by the CotC for the Board; or
        (5) e is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
            eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
            Board.

      (d) A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
          replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
          consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
          Courts of the appointment.

Protoproposal Chaos167 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1693

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1693 be amended to read:

      (a) If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
          shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board
          may rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
          incorrect.

      (b) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
          Judgement was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the
          original Judgement was correct. In that case, the original
          Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the
          original Judgement has legal effect.

      (c) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
          Judgement was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the
          original Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original
          Judge of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The
          Board may then act in one of three ways, provided that a
          majority of the Justices agree:
        (1) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall be
            treated as if it were Judged normally, with the Judgement
            being that which a majority of the Justices agree on.
        (2) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
            dismissed.
        (3) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
            Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
            the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
            originally assigned; the original Judge will be considered
            Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement
            as the original Judge for the same reason.

      (d) If a majority of the Justices find that the original
          Judgement was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices
          agree on what action to take, then the CFJ shall be
          re-assigned as in subdivision (c)(3) above.

No. The implication is that Scott's second message did not have the effect
of _creating_ a second Proposal.

Vlad is claiming that it didn't count as a second  _distribution_ of that
Proposal, and I take no position one way or the other.  Distributing is not
creating.

And BTW:

I was relying on the second paragraph of Rule 1483 (not the third) to
prevent the creation of a new Proposal:

>      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
>      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that

>      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
>      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

That says it for me.

{BTW, the second sentence says to me that if this is to be considered a new
proposal, its proposing entity must make it explicit.  I would reject the
interpretation that restricts this to the proposing entity of the old
proposal.}

I agree. That's why I devised the Priority Bar proposal (to be 
distributed RSN) to allow more priroity levels between 1 and 2.

You can, can't you? I was sure that we adopted a Proposal to that

Not exactly the same reason.  In one case we are trying to prevent
the creation of extraneous entities, which is a direct consequence
of the action of submitting proposal text to the Promotor.  In the other
case, no new entities are created by the action.  You might, however,
want to make an argument out of what happens to the Voting Period
of the Proposal, if the Promotor makes a subsequent distribution.

True.  But it is logically possible for a single Proposal to be
distributed more than once, and so to have multiple
"time of distribution" properties.  Each entity has only
one "time of creation" property.  I guess my point is that
there is no logical reason why multiple distributions of
the same proposal text should create multiple versions
of the Proposal, unless the Rules specifically say so.
The Rules *do* specifically say what happens when
text is delivered to the Promotor, and IMO, the need
to suppress duplication is more obvious.

So?  The Rules grant legal significance to persons but not
to ceramic ashtrays.  Therefore, having a child *is* a
significant legal action wrt Agora.

For me Rule 101 serves two purposes: one, it is a general allegation
of jurisdiction; and two, it provides a choice-of-law-through-time
rule.  I don't see that it defines "Player" any more than § 1 of
Amend. XIV defines "person".

You've just described the (American) constitutional doctrine of
"void-for-vagueness": a law which fails to put the reader on
sufficient notice as to what that law proscribes violates the reader's 
right to due process and is therefore unconstitutional. 

We don't have a guarantee of due process, however; in fact, it's
arguable that we explicitly deny the right to due process at times.
So I'm disinclined to accept the claim that fair notice is required.
