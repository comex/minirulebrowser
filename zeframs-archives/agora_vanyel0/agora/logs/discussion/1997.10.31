As a long time Justice on the Board of Appeals, I don't feel I have
too much work on my hands. At any rate, this idea has hidden pitfalls.
When controversial issues arise, they tend to generate a raft of
related CFJs, which, owing to the controvery, tend to get Appealed.
At such times, it becomes very important to have all or most of the
Appeals heard by more or less the same people, to preserve consistency.
Otherwise, the controversy tends to persist well beyond the point at
which it has ceased to be productive, fun or interesting.

Having checked the Rules myself, I came to the same conclusion. Swann

I don't think there are too many Appeals. It would be nice to have

Agreed. Just because a Board upholds a Judgement, that does not mean
the Appeal was frivolous. It can easily happen that an original Judge's
Judgement is correct, but for reasons unforeseen by the Judge.

Good point. I'd say the CFJ is actually TRUE for that reason.

I doubt it: KoJen tried to perform every action which it is possible
for him to perform. I'd say that the number of actions which it is
possible for him to perform merely by sending a message such as the
above is zero.

The legal claim is doubtful in my opinion. I read R1478 as empowering
me to act, not as directly requiring me to act in any particular way.

The moral claim is complicated. I think I should be allowed some leeway
given that this is a game, and given in particular that this is a game
where exploiting loopholes forms part of the ethos of playing. I'm not
saying that anything goes: I think clearly immoral play is possible in
Agora. But I don't think I've done anything immoral just yet. For the
moment, I want to explore the consequences of our having made our demands
and see where that leads. To interesting play, I hope.

My present intention is to Judge this TRUE. Before I do that, however,
I would like to seek opinions on what Injunctions, apart from the
Injunction to Annotate, I might be able to make. Pretty clearly, the
effect of a true Judgement is that the POs assessed against myself and
Harlequin for Failure to Report should be vacated. Would be it be legal
for me to issue an Injunction vacating them? Is there any other way of
vacating them? Do I have the authority to do as Registrar pro-tem?

If the Judgment is correct, it should not be appealed, IMO, period. The
reasons have nothing to do with it.

Of course, this also means you have a vested interest in the status quo.
Not to suggest that you are not qualified, 

 At any rate, this idea has hidden pitfalls.

I'm not suggesting we get rid of appeals, for Christ's sake. Just penalize
"off the cuff" appeals. I don't see how that would affect consistency in
the slightest. If an appealer can't get even one Justice to see things his
way, then I think it is fair to call the Appeal frivolous.

I must disagree again. In the matter of the Appeals Judgement on the
1045 Injunctions, for instance, I repeatedly stressed the importance
of the two-stage Judicial process in Agora's traditions. The main
reason why this two-stage process works is that Judges are more or
less supposed to shoot from the hip, whereas a Board of Appeals is
expected to give both the Caller's and the original Judge's arguments
careful consideration before making a determination which is
therefore often based on broader issues. IMHO Judgement and Appeal
are quite distinct procedures, each with specific constraints and
benefits, and the purpose of a Board of Appeals often goes beyong
the mere confirmation or invalidation of a Judge's determination.

One crucial difference is in the process of selecting the Judge as 
opposed to selecting Justices; a normal Judge can be any active 
Player, possibly including one who has not sufficient knowledge and 
experience of the workings of Agora to base eir determination on 
sufficient grounds; whereas Justices are elected Officers who will in 
nearly all cases have demonstrated such competence.

You miss an important point - that Judgements, and Judgements in
Appeal, are not merely determinations of TRUE or FALSE. For the
Player who calls for an Appeal, the original Judge's decision of TRUE
or FALSE may be justified, but the Judge's reasoning may seem
ill-founded, or appear to evade important issues. The process of
Appeal often consists precisely in obtaining a deeper understanding
of the issues involved rather than only a binary, all-or-nothing
decision. Also, the Judge may have neglected to issue an Injunction
that the Player calling for Appeal feels is required, in which case
the Justices may elect to do so. All of these are important features
of the Judicial process, which your proto would severely restrict 
access to.

Rule 1504/5 (Power=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

<snip>

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds

      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to

      apply the penalty.

Seems pretty clear to me.

I don't agree that an appeal is ipso facto frivolous simply because all three
justices uphold the original decision.  Sometimes the reasoning behind the
original decision is fuzzy and unclear, or even suspect, to several players. 
When this happens, it is not unreasonable to want the appeals board to take a
closer look and provide clearer, sounder reasoning which can be used to guide
play in the future, even if it seems likely that the actual verdict is probably
correct.

I agree we would like to limit truly frivolous appeals via some minor
punishment, but why not grant the appeals board themselves the power to
penalize what they determine to be frivolous, rather than make it automatic
based on their final verdict?

The reason, I think, is that most Agorans find bugfixing a rather boring
thing to do.

I disagree with your analysis - we often get worried about the Rules. We
just don't stop the Game each time. Is that what you want?

I don't know where you found that... Enough Players are interested in doing
this - the majority I think. Or at least they will support this until they
find there is not much left to improve. Then they prefer breaking it all
up again and starting new.

The reason we want complex Rules is exactly BECAUSE we think simple Rules
have the possibility to do all things other than working. If one fixes all
the obvious holes, the Rule has become long. And, I agree, there is a large
number of non-obvious holes left, most of them created in the process of
hole-fixing moreover.

I voted for abolishing Wins. Rebellion is relatively young, I wouldn't call
it traditional. Furthermore, noone has ever proposed abolishing it. So what
makes you so sure that we wouldn't condone that? The Speaker Transition is
indeed a bit complex. However, we want it to WORK. Just what you seem to want.
Locations don't seem to work very well, for my sake we get rid of them.
Remains only Style as a point where I am of the opinion that it's a nice
thing we should not get rid of.

I agree with you that a major shortening of the Ruleset would be a good
thing. On the other hand - have you ever checked other Nomics? I think
the White elephant containt of Agora is relatively low. Very low maybe even.
It's just that our Walruses are so very large and Elephantlike.

Yes, we do think it is of value. It is just that we don't think it is
necessary to wait until you have your parts of the change ready to accept
some other parts. Is there any reason why first fixing one half, and then
the other half is better than first doing nothing at all and then fix
the whole? That we are in favor of Proposal 3578 does NOT mean that we
think 3578 is better than what you would like to see, just that we think
it is better than the current situation. If you have some improvement
on it, just propose it.

Why should we not change R1042 more than once? Why do you think that if
we want to replace A by B, this makes us hate B'? I don't see the logic.
To my feeling, Steve wanted to change R1042 into something else. He saw
something better, and proposed that. I have voted for Proposals with
known flaws - not because I liked the flaws, but I liked the rest of the
Proposal. There are stages between 'the way it is now' and 'the ideal
way'.

I have another theory: People liked Steve's Proposal without your amendments.
They liked it even more with these amendments, but that wasn't upto vote.

COULD YOU PLEASE RETRACT THESE INSULTS? I FEEL VERY INSULTED BY YOUR REMARKS.
OR AT LEAST SPECIFY WHETHER OR NOT I FALL IN THIS CATEGORY. YES, I AM
SHOUTING. I ALWAYS START SHOUTING WHEN I AM ANGRY. AND THIS KIND OF
REMARKS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY. I DO NOT HATE YOU, NOR DO I THINK THE
MAJORITY OF AGORANS DO.

I do not know whether I am glad you call me honourable, or whether I
feel insulted by getting a Kudo after the baseless rant I think you
wrote above this. It may be just me, but if I like both Proposal A and
Proposal B, and B better than A, I will vote FOR A - especially if B
is not upto vote.

I don't demand enthusiasm, but it would be nice to be able to proto a

of "What's the point?  It already works.  You're just confusing things.".

It wasn't really individuals voting for Steve's Proposal that I had
a problem with.  I'd be perfectly happy to have it amended twice.
What really decided the issue for me was Steve's exhortation to support
the Proposal.  As I explained, I had a problem with Steve dropping a
proto negotiation in the middle, and eir call for support indicated that
this action had not been accidental.

This does disrespect to Judges. And since we are all Judge, it does

It does no disrespect at all.  It is quite possible to agree with a verdict and
disagree with the judges reasoning at the same time, without any disrepect
whatsoever.  IMO, it is not really just the truth or falsity of a judgement
that guides play, it is the reasoning behind the decision that does so.  And I
think this is as it should be.  Therefore it becomes important, without any
disrepect intended whatsoever, to be able to have such reasoning examined,
overturned, or supported independently of the actual verdict.  The appeal is
rightly the place for this.

First, you should not consider a call for appeal to be automatically a personal
insult or a denigration of your intellectual capacities.  But in any case, if
you consider your Judgment carefully, and people agree with your reasoning,
then it probably won't be appealed.  But so what if it is?  If you *don't*
consider it carefully, it will almost certainly be appealed.

Then make it an offense that can be assigned by referendum.

Here it is without. By the way, last time when I claimed there was
no unnecessary stuff added, I might have been wrong. My mail program
might have regarded them as separate mails, through which I did not
see them as added to the message. My apologies.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1061
   Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
 installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
 Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
 the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
	     General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, 
	     Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Morendil (not a player)
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     
Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686
Requested Injunction: see Arguments

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 29 Oct 1997 17:11:54 +0100
  Assigned to Steve, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Here I disagree.  While I have been as guilty as anyone of sometimes
"shooting from the hip" in delivering Judgements, due to a lack
of time, more often than not I come to regret not giving the
CFJ the full analysis it deserves.  I believe the Judge is
(at least morally) obliged to give a CFJ the same full
and detailed consideration e would as if e were a Justice.
I have just recently--given a few recent judgements of mine--resolved
to be more faithful in declining to Judge CFJs if I don't have
time to properly analyze them.

I don't think I would accept even this at the moment, as I don't
see that frivolous appeals are much of a problem.  If they became
one, perhaps.

Now wait a minute. I thought we had agreed that due to bad wording,
Payment Orders do not actually take effect unless they are authorized.

I still think the FALSE Judgement is correct, however. With the current
fuzz about frivolous Appeals, maybe a Concurrent Opinion is in order?

Since I have become CotC, 23 CFJs were judged, if I include from the
Antimatter CFJs only CFJ 971. Of these, five were appealed (of which one
twice), and of a fifth one the Injunctions were appealed. For some reason
I have lost some of my judicial stuff - in particular I see no trace
of CFJ 1050 (or did I make a misnumbering there). Also, has Steve sent
in an Appeal Judgement on CFJ 947 (second appeal)? If so, I lost that
too. And to whom are CFJs 1053 and 1058 currently assigned, if to
anyone? Sorry I have to ask this, but I really don't know where the
stuff has gone.

By the way, I think I'm getting too busy to do this. Could someone please
take over CotC-ship? I want to not be busy with this kind of thing for some
while - I'm getting too slow as it is, and still it takes too much of my
time. Maybe I should take some time off Agora...

This might apply to Payment Orders generally, but I don't think it
applies to improperly reported Infractions.

True enough.  (I doubt I'd vote for either notion at the moment.)

ProtoProposal Chuck107
Read the Ruleset Week

I request AI=1 for this Proposal.

A rule shall be created with the Title "Read the Ruleset Week" and
text as follows:

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

[There's part of me that would rather do it sooner, but December
is already getting into holidays, not to mention finals for those
of us who are students, and many players are away in the early part of
January.  Anyway, I think it would be good to encourage players to
read the whole entire Ruelset at least once a year.]

============================================================

ProtoProposal Chuck108
The Stars and Stripes Forever

I request AI=1 for this Proposal.

A Rule shall be created with the Title "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
and text as follows:

      When Rule 1776 is created, the Rulekeepor shall pay out, to
      the Entity which proposed the Proposal which created Rule 1776,
      13 VTs.  Once that has taken place, this Rule repeals itself.

      If Rule 1776 is not created by a Proposal, this Rule repeals
      itself upon creation of Rule 1776.

[I welcome similar proposals recognizing other nations.]

You have a point there for Infractions in general. However, when taking a
look at the specific case of Wrongful Injunction, Rule 1695's last
paragraph appears to be somewhat poorly worded:

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside. The original Judge is
      guilty of the Infraction of Wrongful Injunction, the
      penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall detect and
      report this penalty.

Does this actually authorize the CotC to detect the penalty? If not,
things may be even stranger than I imagined.

If it does, it still does not quite say whether the authorization is
general, or whether it holds just when an Infraction is actually
committed.

Greetings,
rjan.

I am not the least convinced that that interpretation is justified.
Game Custom does not require that I perpetuate the follies of my

Also submitting every possible CFJ, but I don't think KoJen's
