Why?  VTs are destroyed.  The Banker can create more by power vested in em
by other Rules.  The Transfer Orders can then be executed as soon as it
becomes possible.

There is a large difference between "as soon as possible" and "immediately,
without any intervening game moves".

   I'd like to apologize to everybody concerning both the false
"Bank-ruptcy" idea and the incorrectly phrased "Matador" rule.  I'm
still a newbie around here and I sometimes get a little too excited.
Sorry for all the fuss. :)
