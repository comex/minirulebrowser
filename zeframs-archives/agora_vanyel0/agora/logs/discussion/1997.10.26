General Chaos could not have committed TIA, given that he believed he was
correct at the time he denied the COE.

I do agree that if one wanted to settle the question of whether Harlequin's
message would have constituted satsifactions of the Payment Orders had he
actually possessed at least 4 VTs, a CFJ would be the way to go.

It appears that several people did not take notice of my suggestion. Which
may have been just as well, since the opposition was much stronger than I
had noticed (Et tu, Steve!) and even an additional FOR Vote from all that
declared Presence would not have been sufficient.

I guess I shall have to Propose it anew. However, I remember someone who
had a Proto to readjust Probate further; maybe we should combine them?

I assume that the newly passed Public Voting Experiment will make it
somewhat easier to notice what the opposition is up to, and so the next
attempt will hopefully succeed.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

Knowing that I would be temporary Notary when R1458 was disinfected, 
how could I resist the temptation to have some fun with EiPs?
