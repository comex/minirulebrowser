In line with the general trend of giving different Officers different
kinds of influence on the game which can then interact in interesting
ways (cf Variable Batch Sizes), I've been thinking about the role of
the Chancellor with respect to monetary policy. Macross has already
outlined one important idea: give the Chancellor the power to levy
taxes when the Bank runs out of funds. I like that idea, but it needs
to work in conjunction with independently getting the economy more or
less in balance. So here's another idea: give the Chancellor the
power to set the Basic Officer Salary. This would give the Chancellor
great influence over the number of VTs entering in the economy. When
VT expenditures are low, e can set the BOS low; when VTs get too
scarce, e can increase it. This would be a much more flexible system
than the current one, where every time we want to adjust the levers
of monetary policy, we have to frame and adopt a Proposal to do it.

The final plank in this system also comes from Macross: peg the
total number of VTs in existence at some quite low number, say
10 per player. That ought provide to provide a nice balance of
forces.

I'm flattered that you credit me for inspiring (at least in part) these
ideas, but I must admit that I was in turn inspired by someone else who
recently posted a suggestion to put taxes into effect rather than constantly
minting VT's.  Unfortunately, I don't recall who it was.

I agree that the economy must be better balanced if the idea of a tax is to
work.  Currently, one player could create a VT imbalance simply by
collecting a salary and not spending it.  This would slowly but surely
increase the amount of VTs in existence.  The only way I can see to prevent
this is to cease minting VTs simply to pay bills.  Instead, I suggest that
VTs should be minted only when the limited number of VTs excessively
constrains the activity of the economy.  However, when the supply of VTs is
small this will naturally result in an economic slowdown as players will be
reluctant to spend the few VTs they have.  I can think of no way to prevent
players from employing a slowdown as an effective way to maximize their
wealth.  This leads to the question:  How can players be encouraged to
choose to spend more in a limited VT economy?

In real life it seems to me that there is a sort of minimum pace to the
economy.  Even if everyone decided to spend no more than was absolutely
necessary, saving every spare penny for a rainy day, they still must buy
food to eat, clothes to wear, and a roof under which to live. (Admittedly
this is oversimplified, but I think you'll see what I'm getting at.)  The
problem as I see it is that in Agora EVERY VT is a spare VT.  You never need
spend anything.  How then can the economy be kept moving at a reasonable
minimum pace (i.e. enough to cover the expenses of Officer Salaries) when a
player naturally reacts to the limited VT environment by hoarding VTs to
increase eir wealth?  The only idea I can come up with is to somehow take
into account the pace of the economic activity.  If possible the player
should be made to feel either that excessive hoarding is detrimental
(perhaps through some mechanism of diminishing returns, e.g. your earlier
suggestion to make the BOS a function of the amount of VTs entering the bank
in a given week) or that economic activities provides a return (monetary or
otherwise) equal to what hoarding the VT would have gained (casting a vote,
assuming one has an interest one way or the other in a proposal, has, for
obvious reasons, been viewed as being worth at least a VT).

Lastly:  What factors determine the worth of a VT?

I admit that all this isn't too well thought out and I can't provide much in
the way of suggestions but it's late here (2:40 am).  Hopefully someone will
find something in these ramblings that will help....   As for me I'm going
to bed, perhaps I'll post more after a night's rest.

I like this idea. It would be tricky to abuse, because increasing or
decreasing the BOS would affect all player's income in the same way.

I took it as clearly (though implicitly) being an Application, Signed by

But that's one of the points of having a real economy: there _should_
be a visible difference between rich and poor players. Rich players
can afford to vote more intensively, so why shouldn't they be able to
manipulate the proposal queue more strongly?

I like this very much. Changing the basic officer's salary is one of
the obvious things to do if we want to finetune our economy from within
(as opposed to rule changes, RGB's etc.)

And doing it in a way that increases the political power of the
chancellor adds to the trend of giving more powers to officers. I like
it.

FDC Nomic has eight players, will reach Proposal #200 soon, and recently
experienced its first Scam (using a Rule allowing one player to grant
unlimited rewards to the authors of proposals).

The current Speaker is Leanne Opaskar <alexia@znet.com>, who may or may
not be subscribing to this list shortly.  Further information on the
Gamestate is available at http://www.bayside.net/users/ford/fdcnomic/

Unfortunately we haven't gotten around to defining how we vote in InterNomic
yet; maybe I'll get around to that next week, when things settle down a bit.

The Judge of this Statement presented a clear and concise argument in
favor of the decision. However, I find some of his reasoning flawed;
in particular, I believe that Rule 1339, cited therein, is evidently
not relevant, and I further believe that Rule 754 is not relevant
either.

Should we interpret Rule 754 such that the difference between the
text submitted by Swann as "The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal"
and that posted by Promotor Blob under that title is *not*
"inconsequential", that would not necessarily imply that Swann's
Proposal was *not* distributed. Such an interpretation would merely
imply that Rule 754 is silent on the matter.

Judge Kolja observes that the difference between the two texts is
not one of "spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a
word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation", and draws the
conclusion that, since Rule 754 does not cover this particular kind
of difference, that difference is significant and the truth of the 
Statement follows.

However, I find this line of reasoning suspicious in the extreme, 
because it would lead us to regard as distributed a Proposal 
submitted with the text "A Rule shall be enacted reading thus :" but 
posted by the Promotor as "Yo man, let's create a Rule thingy like 
this here:", a discrepancy far greater than the minor difference 
between Swann's submission and what Promotor Blob posted.

However, I believe that Rule 754 does not govern in such cases; it is
my interpretation that it only concerns *original* statements by
Players. For instance, Rule 754 would apply in the case of a Player
posting a text labeled as an "Aplication to start a Gourp", which
would be considered unambiguously equivalent to an Application to
create a Group.

In the case at hand, however, the Rules require the Promotor to
distribute the text that was submitted to em, not a variation on it;
therefore, it is not enough that (as Rule 754 has it) "the meaning or
validity of such communication is not altered in any way by such
discrepancies"; it must further be the case that such a text be "the
same", in some reasonable sense, as the one which was submitted to
em, for *that* text to have been distributed.

In other words, the issue really hinges on the notion of identity. No
two copies of the text of a given Proposal are, of course,
'identical' in the strictest sense; nevertheless we use an
approximation of considering two bodies of text to be 'identical'
when they differ only in minor particulars. We don't use a formal
definition of how 'minor' the variations need to be, however, expect
as far as Rule changes are concerned (Rule 1339); we rely on an
intuitive notion of it, which, I suppose, could be expressed as 'two
bodies of text are identical if a computer program such as diff would
consider them identical.'. 

Because this notion is not formalized, except in Rule 1339, I
believe the Rules are silent on the matter. I also think it is in the
best interests of the game not to allow a risk of Players voting for
a Proposal unless they are provided with the "exact" (in the above
vague sense) text of that Proposal. I further think that the
discrepancy between the text submitted by Swann and that distributed
by Promotor Blob violates the amovementioned intuitive notion of
identity.

I thus find myself in agreement with the original Judgement of TRUE, 
but unable to support the reasoning behind it. Since this is not yet 
an official decision, I invite comment on whether I should reassing 
or Sustain.

I choose to Sustain the Judge's original Judgement of TRUE, in view
of my opinion in the matter of CFJ 1089 that Swann's Proposal of that
title has not been distributed; I concur with the Judge's reasoning
insofar as if we grant that what Promotor Blob posted was not
Swann's Proposal, then it follows that what Promotor Blob posted was
not in fact a Proposal.

While this doesn't touch the main line of your argument, I don't think
the above statement is necessarily true. It depends on what measure
you use for the difference between two versions of a text. Using the
output of 'diff' or somesuch progam, the above statement is
correct. However, as far as rule changes are concerned, the more
important question seems to be the effect of these rule changes. While
the wording of the two phrases in Morendil's example is quite
different, their effect is the same. On the other hand, in the case of
P3710 the scrambled version is dysfunctional - it tries to replace a
string which doesn't exist where it should (and where it does in the
original version), so the corresponding amendment fails in one case
and succeeds in the other.

Granted, but would *you* be willing to stand for your Proposals being

That's a different story, because such alterations would have to be
intentional. I guess it would be a question of taste and style (as
long as only introductory clauses would be changed, not rule texts) -
I enjoyed the silly messages from the Mad Scientist, so why shouldn't
there be a promotor who uses some funny dialect? 

In principle, you're right, of course.

I don't have a strong opinion (on almost anything ;-) ), I just thought
you should be aware of the issue.

Rule texts as well. If this interpretation is allowed - that is, if
we consider that 754 and 1339 apply to the text of Proposals such
that a Proposal distribution varying from the submitted text only in
ways prescribed by 754/1339 is, for all intents and purposes, the
same text as the submitted Proposal - then the Promotor also has the
right to change capitalization in Rule Changes from your Proposals. E
could go for some silly MAD SCIENTIST TYPE capitalization, for
INSTANCE - and get AWAY with IT !

You are prematurely assuming that the announced Nomic is the _real_
Illuminomic.  Obviously it is just a puppet.

Yes, e could - and why not? It's just a matter of taste, not
function. In a similar, though more serious way, the arrangement of
the rules in the categorized rule set is a matter of taste and style
(yes, I know there are rules that concern this, but still), as are
other matters that are concerned with the presentation of the rules
(as opposed to their function).

Plausible, at least as far as creation, signing and execution are
implicit.  However, I would like the Notary to clarify:

1) Exactly what do you consider the Application body of text to be?
2) Exactly what do you consider the Will SLC to be?

And, how were each of these texts unambiguously specified, in that it was

DIS: Proto-Decision in 1089

I think your remarks here are right on the money.  I would add, in defense of
sustaining the judgement, that a good intuitive notion to use for determining
which "approximations" of text are equivalent would be to check whether the
changes in text cause differences in the implementation of the proposal or in
the semantic meaning of the additions or amendments applied by the proposal. 
In the current case, the differences in text cause both a difference in the
implementation process (different substitutions) and in the semantic meaning of
the created Rules (one specifies date and time completely, one does not).

The Judge of this Statement presented a clear and concise argument in
favor of the decision. However, I find some of his reasoning flawed;
in particular, I believe that Rule 1339, cited therein, is evidently
not relevant, and I further believe that Rule 754 is not relevant
either.

Should we interpret Rule 754 such that the difference between the
text submitted by Swann as "The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal"
and that posted by Promotor Blob under that title is *not*
"inconsequential", that would not necessarily imply that Swann's
Proposal was *not* distributed. Such an interpretation would merely
imply that Rule 754 is silent on the matter.

Judge Kolja observes that the difference between the two texts is
not one of "spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a
word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation", and draws the
conclusion that, since Rule 754 does not cover this particular kind
of difference, that difference is significant and the truth of the 
Statement follows.

However, I find this line of reasoning suspicious in the extreme, 
because it would lead us to regard as distributed a Proposal 
submitted with the text "A Rule shall be enacted reading thus :" but 
posted by the Promotor as "Yo man, let's create a Rule thingy like 
this here:", a discrepancy far greater than the minor difference 
between Swann's submission and what Promotor Blob posted.

However, I believe that Rule 754 does not govern in such cases; it is
my interpretation that it only concerns *original* statements by
Players. For instance, Rule 754 would apply in the case of a Player
posting a text labeled as an "Aplication to start a Gourp", which
would be considered unambiguously equivalent to an Application to
create a Group.

In the case at hand, however, the Rules require the Promotor to
distribute the text that was submitted to em, not a variation on it;
therefore, it is not enough that (as Rule 754 has it) "the meaning or
validity of such communication is not altered in any way by such
discrepancies"; it must further be the case that such a text be "the
same", in some reasonable sense, as the one which was submitted to
em, for *that* text to have been distributed.

In other words, the issue really hinges on the notion of identity. No
two copies of the text of a given Proposal are, of course,
'identical' in the strictest sense; nevertheless we use an
approximation of considering two bodies of text to be 'identical'
when they differ only in minor particulars. We don't use a formal
definition of how 'minor' the variations need to be, however, expect
as far as Rule changes are concerned (Rule 1339); we rely on an
intuitive notion of it, which, I suppose, could be expressed as 'two
bodies of text are identical if a computer program such as diff would
consider them identical.'. 

Because this notion is not formalized, except in Rule 1339, I
believe the Rules are silent on the matter. I also think it is in the
best interests of the game not to allow a risk of Players voting for
a Proposal unless they are provided with the "exact" (in the above
vague sense) text of that Proposal. I further think that the
discrepancy between the text submitted by Swann and that distributed
by Promotor Blob violates the amovementioned intuitive notion of
identity.

I thus find myself in agreement with the original Judgement of TRUE, 
but unable to support the reasoning behind it. Since this is not yet 
an official decision, I invite comment on whether I should reassing 
or Sustain.

It's worth noting that this is true at the moment, while we have
unemployment benefits for non-Officers indexed to the BOS - but
'Plots' proposes to repeal this. On the other hand, if Plots passes,
then all Players will have access to a source of VTs independent
of the BOS, which will mean that the control over monetary policy
given to the Chancellor will be considerably diluted.

This, I think, is the best argument I've heard for 3710 and 3710*'s
difference.

This is interesting in light of former Rulekeepor Wes' campaign of
rampant, if rather random, capitalization. We allowed those changes to
stand. Yet R107 says that Rule Changes must guide play in the form
they were voted on. One can only conclude from this that change in
capitalization does not constitute change in form for the purposes
of R107. So the diff standard for identity of texts goes out the
window.

I am afraid that I am going to have to oppose this proposal, because I 
don't have the time to keep up with the paperwork involved with the 
above. If it could be done monthly I'd be happy, but paying Maintenance
every week is too much work.

What do you think of the suggested limit of 10 VTs per Player? Too high?
About right?

Well, I've just proposed one way which I hope will work: increase (to
three) the minimum VT expenditure required to get a Proposal adopted. 
Of course, it may not work - if Players prefer to hoard VTs rather than
see any Proposal pass. But I'm betting that any significant period of
stagnation, if it occurs, will produce its own political momentum, with
the result that expenditures will rise again. It's open question whether
they will rise enough to account for VT inputs into the economy, 
especially if Plots passes.

Why impossible? Clearly Promotor Crito is holding the Office temporarily
at the moment, according to R786. The fact that Speaker and Arbiter of 
Succession Blob hasn't announced this yet is immaterial.

I think the decision to reassign is appropriate when a) The
Judge has not considered some point which is potentially
relevant to the CFJ, *and* b) the Justice has pointed out
the issue, but has not reached a determination emself on it.

Since you have reached a determination on the issue not
considered by the original judge, I think it would be
entirely appropriate to sustain the Judgement.

All IMO, of course.

Or one may conclude that Agora has been possessed with an
unusual fit of Pragmatism in respect to this.

This report is preliminary, unofficial, and advisory only.
An official version will be posted when I have evaluated
the attempted Rule Changes more thoroughly.  

Where Rule Numbers for new Rules, and Titles of new Rules
where the titles are not specified by the creating Proposal,
are listed, they do not represent an official assignment,
but rather the numbers and titles which I expect to assign.

Proposals which do not enact any Rule Changes are not
listed here.

10 VTs per player seems right to start.  If its too low more VTs can be
minted to slightly increase the supply until a balance can be found.  I do
think it important that this number be given a few weeks (at least) to
settle in before any increase even be considered.  Players will need time to
adjust to their spending habits to the value of VTs.

In order to maximize the effectiveness of their VTs in a limited VT
environment, players will need to concentrate their VTs on a smaller number
of proposals.  This will mean that some proposals which might otherwise have
gotten votes could fail due to this minimum expenditure.  This will tend to
cause supporters of a proposal to try to have few proposals they would like
to vote on up for vote at the same time so that the VTs might not be split
as many ways.  This could lead to the interesting strategy of paying P-Notes
to arrange a larger distribution of proposals they oppose in order to dilute
the support on each individual proposal.  If the supporters want to limit
their VT expenses they may be only able to pass one or two of their choice
proposals out of five.  If the supporters vote for all the proposals, they
will be less able to oppose their nemesis' proposals when they are up for
vote in the next batch.  If they are disorganized they may split their VTs
up in such a way that none of the proposals passes, whether or not they
retain reserve VTs for the next batch.  I can think of many other possible
outcomes.  This could make things real interesting.
