The business of making exceptions is a dangerous one, but I feel that
Kolja and possibly Elde should probably be excepted, or at least
treated differently, when the above adjustment is made, since they
were not registered during the period of high VT supply, and hence
did not benefit from it. My idea is to add these paragraphs to the
Proposal:

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by Elde after 
          the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5, 
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by Elde is 
          adjusted to be 5, and to the increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      (5) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by Kolja A. after 
          the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5, 
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by Kolja A. is 
          adjusted to be 5, and to the increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

Any objections?

Note that since Elde is Maybe Absent, it's quite possible he'll be
deregistered before this takes effect, obviating the need for (4).

Well, thank you for this friendly gesture - I would certainly
appreciate not being cut down to 0.5 VT or so. 

I share your dislike of exceptions, though, especially when they are
obviously tailored to individual players - they may be a good thing in
terms of motivating players or for fairness, but they just don't
"feel" right. Why not make the exception more generic: say, have a
similar exception phrase with "if the number of Voting Tokens
possessed by any player after the adjustment performed above in (3) is
less than 5, ...". This would at least sound more impartial (and it
would also accommodate other new players who might join Agora during
the voting period of this proposal).

By the way, you probably have discussed all this over and over again,
but concerning the strategy of "one-off rules": normally, rules do not
implement one-off effects, and they do not immedately change the game
state, they just provide the static framework within which play takes
place. Single changes of the game state, properties of entities etc
via proposal and vote are deliberately made difficult in the rules (I
guess in that sense the failure of RGBI was in accordance to the game
spirit). 

Now changing things via the formal trick of a self-repealing rule may
work, and be legal, but it somehow feels like sweeping a difficulty
under the rug. What do you think: is it part of a deliberate game
design that arbitrary changes to the game state cannot be made by
adopting a proposal (unless one circumvents that problem with the
clumsy device of a self-repealing rule), so something like RGBII goes
against the spirit of the game, or do we really want to allow such
changes, but we simply haven't yet gotten round to introducing a
loophole-free rule section for that, so we make do improvising within
the rules as they are?

I think Kolja's suggestion that it be made generic (any player with less
than 5 VTs gets 5 VTs) is a good one.

Well, Agora is my first experience with Nomic and I've only been around
for a few months so I haven't seen any discussion of this before (and so
I'm probably not the best spivak to answer this 8).  I've got the impression
that self-repealing rules like this are a standard part of the game and are
in keeping with the spirit of Nomic (but I could be wrong).  Clearly there
needs to be some mechanism for making arbitrary changes to the game
state when the need arises.  Self-repealing rules seem as good or better
a way of doing it as any other, to me.  I would be interested in what your
solution would be that involves some kind of loophole-free rule section.

Well, naively I would think that something like RGBI should work:
simply propose that "when this proposal is adopted, the following
things happen:..." etc., where just about anything may be stated as
"...". 

And naively I would say Rule 594 (Proposals and Rule Changes) allows
exactly that.

Why did RGBI not work, anyway? It failed, and I must admit that I am
not quite aware of the detailed arguments why it did, but there must
be some reason :).

Now in general I can imagine that just making everything accessible to
changes due to "simple", non-rule proposals can lead to a whole lot of
trouble; that's why I said that allowing it would require some
loophole-proofing.

And in fact, it seems to be a rather general principle that many
important things in the game may only change in ways expressly
provided for by some rule; for example, I see this principle in

Rule 1011 Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed
Rule 1513 Authority of Non-Rule Entities
Rule 1586 Definition and Continuity of Entities

The same principle of tying everything to some rule also appears
in many other places, like 

Rule 1728 Actions Without Objection
Rule 1467 Definition of a Currency
Rule 1469 Creation and Destruction of Treasuries
Rule 1472 Transfer of Currencies, esp. point c)
Rule 1596 Currency Transfers, generally

So the situation is this: the naive way, changing things be a mere
proposal, is not possible in spite of Rule 594; there must be a rule
involved. I suspect this limitation is there for a reason, maybe
because it is the only way to avoid lots of loopholes.

But then using self-repealing rules like RGBII seems to me to do - in
spirit - just such a change by mere proposal, while obeying - in form
- the principle that such changes are not allowed, and that a rule
must somehow be involved to make an arbitrary, one-off change.

And it is this tension that I don't quite understand yet - do you
consider this no problem at all, or "looks bad, but works", or "we
just haven't got round to doing it more elegantly, so we keep
improvising" or what?

That isn't so naive, in fact. Before a relatively recent reform,
Proposals had been permitted to contain only two things, Rule Changes
and Directives. You already know about Rule Changes; Directives were
the instruments whereby parts of the Game State other than the Rules
could be modified by a Proposal, and only those Directives that were
specifically authorized by the Rules could have any effect on those
parts of the Game State.

That recent Proposal Reform auhtorized Proposals to make arbitrary
changes to the Game State in the most general terms : that's what 
the language in 594, "implemented to the maximal extent permitted
by the Rules", is all about.

> Why did RGBI not work, anyway? It failed, and I must admit that I am

The reason why it failed is precisely that, rather than make arbitrary
changes to the Game State, it attempted to call upon the procedure of
Currency Transfers to effect a given set of 'monetary' changes. But
the Rules that govern Currency Transfers are quite clear on one point -
that for a Currency Transfer to be valid, there must be a Rule which
specifies a Player required to record (or "detect and report", as Game
Custom has it) that particular kind of Transfer.

RGBI clashed with that particular requirement; the Proposal itself
directed the Assessor to record the Transfers it called for, but that
was not sufficient - a Proposal is not a Rule. (There was also a second
problem with RGBI's attempt to call for Transfers, in that it wasn't
clear that even had Rule 1596 allowed a Proposal to specify a Player
to D&R the Transfers, Rule 594 would have been sufficient to authorize
a Proposal to effect those Transfers. But that question didn't have to
be addressed, as the D&R problem was, clearly, enough to make RGBI fail.)

Actually, the intent of the aforementioned Proposal reform was to bring
about just such a situation; it was adopted, presumably, because it was
felt that the Rules contained sufficient safeguards against abuse of the
procedure. The prevalent argument, IIRC, is that there's nothing that can
be done with a Proposal with the current 594 that couldn't be done
previously with a Proposal enacting one or more self-repealing Rules.

Well, the answer to that, I think, is that a self-repealing Rule can,
nevertheless, do things that a Proposal implementing arbitrary Game
State changes cannot do. For instance, it's far from clear that a
Proposal can have lasting effects, or impose obligations upon Players.
Various arguments can be made for and against the effectiveness of
all but the first of the following Proposal provisions :

   When this Proposal is adopted, every Player's VT holdings shall be
   set to 0.

   When this Proposal is adopted, every Player shall be required to
   donate all VTs to the Bank As Soon As Possible.

   For ten days after this Proposal is adopted, no Player may possess
   any VTs.

   When this Proposal is adopted, all Players shall be awarded the
   Patent Title of Nothinghead.

   There are Entities known as Happy Pills; whenever a Player, for
   any reason, holds no Happy Pills, he receives one.

   The Nomic Century begins on the first day of any year, the last two
   digits of which are "00", and lasts for one hundred years.

All of these provisions would be controversial to some degree, IMHO,
because what they attempt to "do" is usually regarded as the exclusive
province of the Rules : impose requirements, specify a duration, create
Entities, define new terms...

I think your perception of a "tension" here derives from the fact that
the current form of Rule 594 muddles the dividing line between Rules and
Proposals. One of the reasons why the last Proposal Reform was successful
was that Directives were generally considered useless and mostly broken.

Personally, I think it could be quite useful to model a multi-tiered
Proposal system after real-world law, and institute a graded series
of Game-State-changing instruments including Directives (changing,
like the Directives of old, specific and restricted parts of the Game
State), Orders (imposing requirements on Players), Decrees (with
authority to create or define Entities), Proposals (changing Rules),
Constitutional Amendments, etc. These could be used to bring about
the much-talked-about extension to Officer's powers.

BROWN v. THE STATE

No. 50641

Court of Appeals of Georgia
134 Ga. App. 771; 216 S.E.2d 356

April 30, 1975, Argued
May 9, 1975, Decided

PRIOR HISTORY:

   Drug violation.  Chatham Superior Court.  Before Judge Harrison.

DISPOSITION: Judgment reversed.

COUNSEL: Robert J. Erb, for appellant.

   Andrew J. Ryan, Jr., District Attorney, for appellee.

JUDGES: Evans, Judge.  Deen, P. J., and Stolz, J., concur.

OPINIONBY: EVANS

OPINION:   [*771]     [**356]

   The D. A. was ready
   His case was red-hot.
   Defendant was present,
   His witness was not. n1

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   n1 See Wheat v. Fraker, 107 Ga. App. 318 (130 SE2d 251), for precedent in
writing an opinion in rhyme.

   [*772]
   He prayed one day's delay
   From His honor the judge.
   But his plea was not granted
   The Court would not budge. n2

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   n2 I profoundly apologize to Judge Sol Clark, of this court, for invading
the field of innovation and departure from normalcy in writing opinions;
especially in the copious use of footnotes.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   So the jury was empaneled
   All twelve good and true
   [**357]
   But without his main witness
   What could the twelve do? n3

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   n3 This opinion is placed in rhyme because approximately one year ago, in
Savannah at a very convivial celebration, the distinguished Judge Dunbar
Harrison, Senior Judge of Chatham Superior Courts, arose and addressed those
assembled, and demanded that if Judge Randall Evans, Jr. ever again was so
presumptious as to reverse one of his decisions, that the opinion be written
in poetry.  I readily admit I am unable to comply, because I am not a poet,
and the language used, at best, is mere doggerel.  I have done my best, but
my limited ability just did not permit the writing of a great poem.  It was
no easy task to write the opinion in rhyme.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   The jury went out
   To consider his case
   And then they returned
   The defendant to face.
   "What verdict, Mr. Foreman?"
   The learned judge inquired.
   "Guilty, your honor."
   On Brown's face -- no smile.
   "Stand up" said the judge,
   Then quickly announced
   "Seven years at hard labor"
   Thus his sentence pronounced.
   [*773]
   "This trial was not fair,"
   The defendant then sobbed.
   "With my main witness absent
   I've simply been robbed."
   "I want a new trial --
   State has not fairly won."
   "New trial denied,"
   Said Judge Dunbar Harrison.
   "If you still say I'm wrong,"
   The able judge did then say
   "Why not appeal to Atlanta?
   Let those Appeals Judges earn
   part of their pay."
   "I will appeal, sir" --
   Which he proceeded to do --
   "They can't treat me worse
   Than I've been treated by you."
   So the case has reached us --
   And now we must decide
   Was the guilty verdict legal --
   Or should we set it aside?
   Justice and fairness
   Must prevail at all times;
   This is ably discussed
   In a case without rhyme. n4

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   n4 See Murphy v. State, 132 Ga. App. 654-658 (209 SE2d 101), wherein a
well-written and well-reasoned opinion discusses the reasons why a denial of
motion to continue in a criminal case was erroneous and subject to reversal.

   The law of this State
   Does guard every right
   Of those charged with crime
   Fairness always in sight.
   [*774]
   To continue civil cases
   The judge holds all aces.
   But it's a different ball-game
   In criminal cases. n5

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   n5 See Hobbs v. State, 8 Ga. App. 53, 54 (68 SE 515), where it is
demonstrated that a motion to continue in a criminal case must not be
judged with the same meticulous severity as in civil cases.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -End Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

   Was one day's delay
   Too much to expect?
   Could the State refuse it
   With all due respect?
   Did Justice applaud
   Or shed bitter tears
   When this news from Savannah
   First fell on her ears?
   We've considered this case
   Through the night -- through the day.
   As Judge Harrison said,
   "We must earn our poor pay."
   This case was once tried --
   But should now be rehearsed
   And tried one more time.
   This case is reversed!

   Judgment reversed.

I would interpret this to award a Happy Pill to everyone who does not

I've considered suggesting a provision allowing a Proposal to
establish obligations (with limitations).  I don't think it would be
all that hard to do.

Proposals take effect at the moment of their adoption, and not later, I
believe.

Also, it does not make Happy Pills Nomic Entities. Hmm.

I don't think that's a great idea, myself. One thing I know from
experience is *not* a good idea is having proposals create unique
entities, or entities with any sort of power not defined in the rules
(even if we decide that's legal). They're can get hard to keep track of,
fast.

Thank you for volunteering, Friend Citizen.

Hmm, let's see if there's a logical grouping for the nature (rather than
the lack-of-controversy) of the changes that can occur Without Objection:

* Whether a medium is a Public Forum
* Name of a Rule Category
* Which Rule Category a Rule is in
* Title of a Rule
* Name of a Location not named in the Rules
* Friendliness of a Nomic

What do you think?

I dunno. Personally, I'd like to see the correction of spelling errors in
the Ruleset added to this list.

Favor, this is so brilliant that you'd get a kudo for posting it
if you were still a Player.

As the author of RGB I & II, I can tell you that I regard the form
that RGB II takes as a self-repealing Rule as a regrettably inelegant
necessity. The point of the most recent reform of the Proposal system
(see P3445, adopted Mar 26, 1997) was precisely to allow these kinds
of game state changes without the need to enact self-repealing Rules.
RGB I attempted to exploit this possibility, but ran into technical
difficulties, for details of which see the Judgement of CFJ 928.
The failure of RGB I has made me wary: a similar failure of RGB II
to be effective on technical grounds would be personally rather
embarrassing. Additionally, the conceptual terrain in the area of
currency transfers is about to be transformed by 'Pragmatic Currencies',
which in my opinion makes it even more likely that I would make a
mistake if I tried to finesse this and do it as elegantly as might
be possible. Once bitten, twice shy, I guess: RGB II is a little
inelegant, but it's pretty safe. Having said that, I have tried to
make RGB II as elegant as I can within the constraints I have chosen.

It's an interesting question how the Proposal reform enacted by P3445
will interact with the Currency reform currently being voted on as
P3533. Aside from the list of provisions of controversial effectiveness
given by Morendil, there's the question of whether wholesale changes
to Currency holdings can easily be achieved as Transfers in the
Pragmatic Currencies framework. I take it, for instance, that it would
be pretty messy (although perfectly legal) for a Proposal to create
a large number of Transfer Orders (in the case of RGB II, one for
every Player, another one for every Contestmaster, and a few others),
which individual Players would then have to satisfy by making the
appropriate Payment Orders. Too much work for the Assessor, I reckon.
The alternative might be to have the Proposal give a once-off authority
to the Assessor, or the Chancellor, to satisfy Transfer Orders without
the consent of the Players (basically a form of asset-seizing). But
I'm not sure if a Proposal can do that under the new system, which is
one of the reasons I decided to frame RGB II in the form of
adjustments rather than Transfers.
