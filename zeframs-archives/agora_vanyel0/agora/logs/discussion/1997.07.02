Hmm.  You know, I think that is a perfectly reasonable interpretation.

Some other typos:

In several places: (the amendments to 1654 and 1670 come to mind) the rule
is written so that an Officer "pays" a player instead of "pays out" to a
player. This will not fit the requirement of the new definition.

In The Probate Code, section 3: Distribution of Assets should begin "For
each currency _of_ which the estate possesses units..."

Well, it will be fine to call me Kolja, but for myself I'll try to use
"Kolja A." to avoid confusion with other contexts where I use that
nickname. ok?

It would be a bribe if I'd given it to you beforehand. There's no incentive
to do something if you don't find out about a bribe until afterward.

I shall, um, keep that in mind. :)

Speaking of New and Interesting Contest Schemes...

I offered up two Contest Schemes recently. I don't know if they were New,
but *I* thought they were Interesting, and nobody told me different.
However, nobody registered in either. So I raise the question: are players
really interested in participating in Contests? I would really like to give
the Agoraverse Tag a try, if 4+ players want to join. I mean, it's free! :)

The problem is, IMHO, the same problem which has existed since the early
"Cambrian Explosion" in Agora, way back near the beginning.

There are too many Entities and Concepts, and Players become Numb.

And there's no reason to participate in most of these Contests. I mean
"economic" reason. And there can't be an economic reason until there's an
economy. And I don't want to get into a discussion right now of the reasons why
a real economy hasn't developed after all these years (although I do have some
thoughts on the matter, but am not entirely convinced that they're correct).

In the absence of an economy, perhaps we need a Rule which REQUIRES Players to
participate in at least one MEANINGFUL Contest, and automatically nullifies
Contests which gather no interest. Yes I'm serious.

The problem is, IMHO, the same problem which has existed since the early
"Cambrian Explosion" in Agora, way back near the beginning.

There are too many Entities and Concepts, and Players become Numb.

And there's no reason to participate in most of these Contests. I mean
"economic" reason. And there can't be an economic reason until there's an
economy. And I don't want to get into a discussion right now of the reasons why
a real economy hasn't developed after all these years (although I do have some
thoughts on the matter, but am not entirely convinced that they're correct).

In the absence of an economy, perhaps we need a Rule which REQUIRES Players to
participate in at least one MEANINGFUL Contest, and automatically nullifies
Contests which gather no interest. Yes I'm serious.

Oh, goodie, fresh meat!  Bwa ha hah!

Seriously, welcome to Agora.  Registrar Steve should be filling you in
shortly with various useless information as required by Rule 1494.
You should also be aware that, as a New Player, you have certain
privileges: see Rules 1583, 1676, 1677, and 1678.  You are also
entitled to vote on all Proposals presently being Voted upon; Assessor
Steve (Steve is a busy fellow) should be able to identify what those
are as well (I think the only outstanding Proposals are 3527, 3528,
and 3259, but I may be in error in that regard.)  While nowhere
legislated, as the current Speaker (for, admittedly, only two days so
far), I believe I have at least a moral obligation to help new Players
get settled, so feel free to ask me any questions you might have.

Registration is an instant event.  You're registered.  So post,

Unless, of course, the person you're bribing is telepathic. Which I absolutely, 
categorically deny being. During my tenure as Mad Scientist, I was *not* 
mutated by strange experiments and given paranormal powers. That is absolutely 
untrue. Hmmmmzzzzzzzzz.....

Never trust someone who accepts bribes - how do you know they will not 
simply accept a bigger bribe from someone else?

I really should knock my Contest of Prediction Regulations into shape
for tournament play to allow more than two Players to compete, either
in round-robin or knockout play. In the meantime, if any two Players
feel like challenging each other, the Regulations in their current
form are almost useable. Only minor tweaks necessary, I hope.

Anyone interested?

I never accept bribes.  I am, however, open to reasonable
arrangements.

I _do_ have principles, you know. Not accepting bribes just isn't one of them 
:-) (at least not in Nomic). If I am bribed, I stay bribed or your money back.

I thought I might post the most recent version of the Regulations
of A Contest of Prediction. I've substituted VTs for EVs, but left
everything else unchanged. Looking at these now, I can see that
some provision would need to be made for the possibility of
Emergency and Guillotine Proposals. That will require some thought.
The Regulations on passing and forfeiture also remain somewhat murky,
and I now wonder whether it might not be worth producing a simplified
set of Regulations in which the option of passing was simply removed.

Disclaimer: this post is merely for discussion purposes; I am not
creating a Contest.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                      Regulations of A Contest of Prediction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 0: Administrivia

0.0   The name of this Contest is A Contest of Prediction.

0.1   The Contestmaster is Eljefe. The Contestmaster may replace
      himself as Contestmaster with another Player, provided that the
      Player consents, or he may be replaced by another Player, at the
      insistence of all Contestants, provided that the Player consents.
      In either event, this regulation shall be automatically amended to
      indicate the identity of the new Contestmaster.

0.2   Only Chuck and Steve may enter as Contestants. The entry fee is
      10 VTs. The match commences only when both Chuck and Steve
      have transferred the entry fee to the Contest Fund, and if they 
      have met all other conditions of entry set out in these
      Regulations. The 20 VTs in the Contest Fund are called the
      'grand prize'.

0.3   It is a condition of entry into the Contest that neither
      Contestant hold the Offices of Promotor or Assessor. Neither
      Contestant is permitted to assume these Offices voluntarily
      during the course of the match. If either Contestant comes
      to hold either of these Offices involuntarily during the course
      of the match (eg due to being Speaker), then play is suspended
      as soon as these Regulations permit it to be, until such time
      as neither Contestant holds either Office.

0.4   All Currency transfers required by these Regulations are to be
      detected and reported by the Contestmaster.

0.5   The Regulations may be amended at any time with the unanimous
      consent of the Contestmaster and both Contestants.

0.6   In the event of a dispute about these Regulations, the 
      Contestmaster is empowered to act as referee, and make a
      binding determination.

0.7   At the end of the match, and after the grand prize has been
      been dispersed, this Contest is dissolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 1: Definitions

1.0   The word 'point' refers to points scored by Contestants in the
      course of play in the Contest, and not to any form of Agoran
      Currency.

1.1   The word 'batch' refers to a set of Proposals distributed in a
      single message by the Promotor.

1.2   The word 'game' refers to a single encounter between the
      Contestants, in which each has the opportunity to select a
      Proposal, the outcome of which is to be predicted by the other
      Contestant. The Proposals selected by each Player in any
      single game come from the same batch. Each game concludes when
      the Voting Periods of the Proposals in that batch conclude. 

1.3   Once one of the Contestants has specified in the Public Forum a
      Proposal the outcome of which is to be predicted by the other
      Contestant, that game is said to be 'afoot'.

1.4   The word 'match' refers to a series of games, over the course
      of which each Contestant makes 5 predictions.

1.5   The term 'selection deadline' refers to a time 3 days after
      the distribution of a batch of Proposals by the Promotor.

1.6   The term 'prediction deadline' refers to a time 6 days after
      the distribution of a batch of Proposals by the Promotor.

1.7   The term 'publication deadline' refers to a time 9 days after
      the distribution of a batch of Proposals by the Promotor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2: Play

2.0   Unless play is suspended, each game of the match commences when
      a batch of Proposals is distributed by the Promotor.

2.1   Prior to the selection deadline, each of the Contestants shall
      specify in the Public Forum a Proposal in the current batch,
      the outcome of which is to be predicted by the other Contestant.
      This is called 'selection'. During this period, either or both
      of the Contestants may also specify that e passes, ie, e declines
      to specify a Proposal in the batch, provided that e is permitted
      by these Regulations to do so, as set out below. A Contestant
      may not make a selection or pass in a game if there is game
      which commenced earlier and for which that Contestant has not
      yet either made a selection or indicated that e is passing. If
      a Contestant is still permitted to pass, then failure to make a
      selection before the selection deadline counts as a pass. If a
      Contestant is not permitted to pass, then failure to make a
      selection before the selection deadline results in forfeiture
      of the game, with the effects described elsewhere in these
      Regulations.

2.2   Each Contestant has the option to pass at most twice during the
      match. A Contestant passes by announcing in the Public Forum
      before the selection deadline that e is passing for that game,
      or, if e has not already passed twice, by failing to make a
      selection before the selection deadline. A Contestant need
      never pass if e does not wish to do so, provided that there
      have not yet been 5 games in which e either made a selection or
      forfeited due to failure to make a selection. However, if there
      have been a total of five games in which a Contestant has
      either made a selection or forfeited due to failure to make a
      selection, that Contestant *must* pass (this does not apply to
      tie-breakers). A Contestant who has already passed twice during
      the match may not pass again. A Contestant who has passed is
      still required to make a prediction of the outcome of the
      Proposal selected by eir opponent, if any.

2.3   If a Proposal has been selected for which a Contestant is to
      predict the outcome, such a prediction is to be lodged with the
      Contestmaster before the prediction deadline. A Contestant may
      predict at most one of the outcomes, pass or fail. If a
      Contestant fails to lodge a prediction on a selected Proposal
      with the Contestmaster before the prediction deadline, then e
      forfeits that game, with the effects described elsewhere in
      these Regulations.

2.4   For each Contestant who is required to make a prediction in
      a given game, the Contestmaster is required to publish the
      prediction of that Contestant, or the fact that e forfeited
      due to failure to make a prediction, in the Public Forum
      before the publication deadline.  If both Contestants are
      required to make predictions, then the publications for
      both Contestants must be made in the same message.  Once the
      Contestmaster is able to do so, e is encouraged to publish
      this information as early as possible in the game.  However,
      if e does not do so before the publication deadline, then e
      may not publish it until after the end of the game, and must
      do so as soon as possible after the end of the game.

2.5   Play can be suspended, either by mutual agreement of the
      Contestants, or as otherwise set out in these Regulations.
      If the suspension is by mutual agreement of the Contestants, the
      duration of the suspension must be clearly specified, either by
      naming a day the suspension is to be lifted, or by specifying
      the length of the suspension. The Contestants may not agree to
      suspend play 'until both agree the suspension shall be lifted'
      or such like. The Regulations may impose such conditions on the
      length of suspension of play as they see fit to impose. If the
      Contestants agree to suspend play, they shall inform the
      Contestmaster of their agreement. As soon as possible after
      becoming so informed, the Contestmaster shall announce the
      suspension of play and its duration in the Public Forum. Play
      is then suspended as of the Contestmaster's announcement.

2.6   Suspension of play shall be effected as follows: all games
      which are currently afoot are completed and scored normally as
      set out in these Regulations. Games which have commenced but
      which are not yet afoot are abandoned (and not scored) with no
      penalty to either Contestant, ie neither Contestant shall
      forfeit, nor suffer any penalties for forfeiture, that might
      arise from such an abandoned game. Furthermore, no new game
      shall commence while play is suspended.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 3: Scoring.

3.0   Each Contestant scores one point for a correct prediction,
      and zero points for an incorrect prediction. Thus, a perfect
      score in the match for either Contestant is 5 points.

3.1   In any game in which neither Contestant passed, and the score
      for that game is 1-0 in favor of one of the Contestants (ie one
      has made a correct prediction while the other has made an
      incorrect prediction), the Contestant making the correct
      prediction is the winner of that game, and 3 VTs are
      transferred to em from the other Contestant.

3.2   If a Contestant forfeits a game through failing to make a
      prediction before the prediction deadline, then for the
      purposes of these Regulations, e is deemed to have made an
      incorrect prediction in that game. If a Contestant forfeits a
      game through failing to make a selection before the selection
      deadline, then for the purposes of these Regulations, the other
      Contestant is deemed to have a made a correct prediction in
      that game.

3.3   Each Contestant makes exactly 5 predictions during the
      match, excluding tie-breakers as described below. Once a
      Contestant has made 5 predictions in the match, that Contestant
      makes no further predictions, although games continue to be
      played until both Contestants have made 5 predictions.

3.4   At the end of the match, the Contestant with the highest
      cumulative score over all the games of the match is the winner
      of the match, and of the grand prize. The contents of the
      Contest Fund are transferred to em. In the event of a tie, two
      extra tie-breaker games shall be played to determine the
      winner, with neither Contestant permitted to pass during the
