I would prefer:

       The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar 
       selects two random integers, the first between the number of 
       Rebellious Players and twice that number, inclusive, and the 
       second between the number of non-Rebellious Players and twice 
       that number, inclusive. If the first number is greater than 
       the second, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

This makes less than one-third of all players being Rebellious 
guaranteed failure, and more than two-thirds guaranteed success.

Perhaps you should change it to reflect the new VT rules? :-)

Well, I never claimed anything as far as my Votes on any INPs other than 
342-345 - I'm not sure you can deny a COE I never made. :)

Reread your original COE.  It stated "This did not count my Votes on
324-345."
^^^

You may not have intended to make such a COE, but you did.

Somehow I doubt that "324" can be unambiguously interpreted--even
in that context--to mean "342."

You're saying someone _could_ have thought I was referring to Votes on INPs
dating back to, what, February of this year ? Hmmm...
