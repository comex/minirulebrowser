Sure. 

I think I'm a good candidate for the job because I'm experienced,
having held the Office continuously for the year between November 97
and November 98.  

Knowing the job well means that I am less likely to make mistakes. 

There's not much scope in the Registrar's position to make many
promises to potential electors as there are not many discretionary
powers available to the job.  About the only example is the ability of
the Registrar to waive reporting of Failure to Report infractions.
This is an ability I have used sparingly in the past, and I don't
intend to make a habit of it.

To my mind, official reports are the Agoran life-blood, and I believe
that the penalties that accrue to Officers who fail to report are a
useful motivational effect in keeping that "life-blood" flowing.
Therefore, I promise to be thorough in reporting these Infractions.
On the other hand, there may be good reasons for being lenient, and I
will not be entirely rigid.  Naturally, the Speaker is also able to
report these Infractions at their discretion, so I will never have a
monopoly on this decision. 

Michael.

You and Vlad seem not yet to have understood the basic original principle
of the Indulgence system:

- It should _not_ be possible to get enough Indulgences simply by waiting
for them to fall into your lap.  They are supposed to be so rare that a
Criminal does not have enough, but _must_ trade for them with someone
else.  And then some - in the original system there was always _one_
Indulgence too little for the total need of Players, to keep the system
going.  At the moment, due to various Rule bugs that have occasionally
wiped out all Blots, there is a great surplus of Indulgences - if you can 
just get off your butt and trade for them.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

But what does a new Player have to trade with? Only the 5 VTs and
1 P-Note he starts out with. And, under this proposal, it'd usually
be less than 5 VTs. It's possible to parlay that into more, but only
if one is familiar with the system. So a new Player with a Blot is
reliant on charity; either for an Indulgence or for VTs and P-notes
he spends to obtain the indulgence. One hardly needs to be a 
criminal to gain one Blot. The mere fact that you are unwilling to
hand out one measly Indulgence to a new Player, even when it doesn't
come out of your own pocket, indicates that you feel it is worth
more than the 1 P-note and handful of VTs you apparently have no
problem with.

The mere fact that I am interested in the overall Indulgence balance
should indicate to you that it is their not coming out of anyone's pockets
which is the problem.

Actually I think Indulgences are worth more than a P-Note or a VT,
which is good.  The extreme scarcity of Indulgences was supposed
to have been a major incentive for getting trading going and
jump-starting the "economy".  It's interesting that it has never
really succeeded in doing so.  Even when there is a surplus
of Indulgences available, there have been few trades, in spite
of the fact that  one or two Players are getting more and more Blots
through PI infractions.

Here's a compromise.  Whenever a new Player registers, the Herald
randomly (or maybe not randomly) selects a Player with an Indulgence
and forces em to give it to the new Player.  What about that?

It's not removing it, it's deregulating it.  It becomes up to the
Registrar whether to remove it or not.  Perhaps--if keeping the
colors is something you care about--you should ask the current
Registrar candidates their feelings on that.

I also note that coloring the Registrar's pages was *originally* an
unregulated action on the part of the Registrar, and only after
he had done that for a while was it required by the Rules.

Another New Player Award Tweak

Amend Rule 1677 as follows:

      As soon as possible after the start of a new Player's Grace
      Period, the following actions are authorized and required:

      (a) The Registrar shall pay out 1 P-Note and a number of Voting
          Tokens equal to the lesser of 5 or the Voting Token
          Circulation Level to the new Player.
      (b) If there is at least one Immaculate Player who possesses
          one or more Indulgences and whose Grace Period has expired,
          the Herald shall select one such Player and order em to pay
          one Indulgence to the new Player.

[I made this a kind of perk for the Herald.  If there is objection to this
it would be easy to make it a random selection (or one from the most
affluent).]

I vaguely remember objecting to the codification of the colors at that

Opposed.  I am against the random redistribution of wealth.  Agora is

And also on the rather paradoxical Agoran mindset that wants to create

wealth.

Actually, I think the "economy" camp is quite small. Some Players
want limitations on what actions Players can perform and how often
they can perform them. That doesn't require inequities in wealth.

And the question arose because Oerjan objected to creating Indulgences
(as if the number of Indulgences is some magic amount, unlike the
number of P-notes). So we redistribute them. The wealthy pay more in
taxes, don't they?

I just saw ElJefe offer 1.5 VT for an Indulgence and find a seller
almost immediately. If a new player really needs an Indulgence, 1.5 VT
shouldn't be an overly large burden. If they didn't have an immediate
need they could probably get them for much less.

I wouldn't consider the shifting of one Indulgence to be much of a
resdistribution of wealth.  It certainly won't eliminate any inequities
in the holdings of Indulgences.

As Oerjan pointed out, the idea has been to have a balance of Indulgences
that is always one less than the number of outstanding Blots and we have never
been able to achieve this situation long enough for us to"play it out",
so to speak.  If you want to maintain this balance and give an Indulgence to
new Players, you will have to take it away from somebody.  If G.Chaos is
going to oppose this compromise, then I will oppose any attempt to give
new Players a free Indulgence.

BTW, as written, the proposal would not result in a *random* redistribution
because the Herald can choose the donator at eir discretion.

Scott was not being perfectly rational. He probably could have
extorted much more.

And if you disagree, and Indulgences are worth only 1.5 VTs each, then
handing one out free shouldn't alter the fundamental economics all
that much.

You miss my point. Because there is an extreme -excess- of Indulgences,
they have become cheap.

I find the idea that one can support oneself to be counterintuitive,
like the idea that you can scale a high wall by pulling yourself up by
your own bootstraps. Surely the idea of Actions with Support is that they
have the support of *other Players*. It's clear that the Player seeking
to make the change supports it, otherwise e wouldn't be seeking to make
it.

If we leave it the way it is, then no action should ever be designated
as being an action which someone can perform "With Support", for this is
precisely equivalent to allowing the action to be performed by the
Player unilaterally. If you want a Player to be able to take unilateral
action, just say so, and leave the Support baggage out of it. For
example, we don't say that the Chancellor can set the BOS With Support.

Not quite--there's a minimum four-day delay involved in "With Support".
You can try to talk em out of it, if you like.

As I've said a number of times, I'm not interested in creating an
economy per se, but in designing an interesting and well-balanced game.
Moderate and temporary inequities in wealth are completely consistent
with the pursuit of that aim. Massive and persistent inequities in the
resources available to certain Players, with no checks or balances in
place to correct the situation, are, however, symptoms of a badly
designed game. Monopoly is a case in point. Once you get behind, there's
not a lot you can do about it except watch the others Players get richer
and richer while you go bankrupt. It's not much fun, which is why I hate
Monopoly. But at least in Monopoly, an individual game only lasts for
some hours; you can play a fresh game the next day or the next week and
start again with a level playing field and the hope that maybe this game
you'll strike it rich. Agora has been going for over 5 years. To get the
analogy with Agora right, you'd have to imagine that in every game of
Monopoly you play, you start in the same position you finished in last
time, ie, completely dominant or totally bankrupt. I think it's
perfectly obvious that this is a terrible and stupid way to design a
game, but nevertheless this appears to be what Scott wants, if we are to
judge by his ceaseless complaints whenever any gesture at a check or
balance is made.
