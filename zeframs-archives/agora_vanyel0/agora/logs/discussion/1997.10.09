I would have thought your Report should reflect the difference in 
state of affairs between "Blob is not a Player" and "Blob is a Player
with no Voting Tokens."

I assume that you say Elde has VTs because they have not yet been disposed
of according to the Probate Code? In all the kerfuffle about who Blob's
EiP is, have we forgotten that Elde, due to his deregistration, is now
in Probate and requires an EiP of eir own? Notary Murphy?

Strong agreement from me. I interpret the 'would' in R1738's
precedence claim ("This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule
which would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.")
simply as making this very point: if the Rules were to conflict,
then R1738 would take precedence over it. In particular, I don't
think it means that R1738 takes precedence over R1478 whether or
not there is a conflict.

I was at first rather surprised by this remark. My first reaction to
it was to think: "Well, then, you must find it mighty hard being a
Judge!" I had thought that you were saying that it made you
uncomfortable extracting *principles* from particular cases and
generalizing them, which sounds to me like a fair description of
what Judges do. But then I read it more closely, and I realized
that you were referring to specifically to 'provisions', and not
to 'principles'. I guess my response is to point out that I
wasn't recommending such expansion as a general policy, only its
appropriateness in this particular case. It's one of the most
basic principles of jurisprudence to treat like cases alike, and
I think you must agree that the cases of multiple Proposals adopted
at the same time and multiple provisions in a Proposal are very
much alike. If you recall that at one time, Proposals were restricted
to a single provision each, then the similarity between the two
cases is even more apparent. One might say that R376 was our previous
answer to almost exactly the same question. As such, it constitutes
pretty persuasive game custom about how such questions should be
answered.

Is this wrong, or am I missing some quirk of how the Rules for Dismissal

It is not the duty of the Assessor to report on who is and is not a
Player.  I believe the Registrar has that duty.  I merely report on
who (or what) owns Voting Tokens, and how many.  Since Playerhood is
not a prerequisite to owning Voting Tokens, it is not a relevant
issue.

Correct.  Morendil has yet to perform eir duties.  It is, I think,

Yes, I see that now.

We're not arguing about the law here - I didn't make a COE, nor have
I alleged that you failed to do your duty in any way. Perhaps I can
make myself clearer in this way: I politely request of you that in
future, your VT Reports include every registered Player, even those
who own no VTs. Purely as a convenience to me, you understand.

What's the problem? Is it the use of the word 'overturn'?

True.

True.

False. Elde cannot be Blob's EiP, because he cannot be Blob's Executor.
My view that Blob is eir own Executor, and therefore (by R1738) eir 
own Executor in Probate.

>I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement:

True, because the first disjunct is true. The second disjunct could
not be true, since R1478 states that if all else fails, a Player is
eir own Executor.

No Rule states it, but Rules 1478 and 1738 together imply it. An EiP is
a kind of Executor, and Executors must be Players. Therefore, a Player
acting as an EiP who is deregistered and ceases to be a Player ceases
to act as an EiP.

I don't understand. Can you be more explicit about exactly how Rules
1478 and 1738 are in conflict, and how the resolution of this conflict
results in Elde remaining Blob's EiP despite the fact that this is
obviously impossible?

Rereading the Rule, the word 'Overturns' is chosen badly. I think 'finds the
Judgement incorrect' would have been better.

I'm puzzled by some error messages I'm getting from gecko, and I'm
wondering if some of the mail gods can enlighten me. (I can hear
Oerjan saying "I'm not a mail god, but I play one in Agora." :)

Here's the puzzle: for every message sent to any of the three lists,
I'm receiving an error report concerning delivery to Vlad. Each report
looks exactly the same. They have a header like this:

Return-Path: <MAILER@MIZZOU1.missouri.edu>
Date: Thu, 09 Oct 97 03:40:43 CDT
To: owner-agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
Subject: mail delivery error

Batch SMTP transaction log follows:

220 MIZZOU1 Columbia MAILER R2.10 ptf000 BSMTP service ready.
050 HELO MIZZOU1
250 MIZZOU1 Hello MIZZOU1
050 MAIL FROM:<owner-agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>

554-Mail not delivered to some or all recipients:
554 No such local user: C647100
050 QUIT
221 MIZZOU1 Columbia MAILER BSMTP service done.

Followed by the text of the message, with complete headers. The weird
thing is that I've checked with Vlad, and he's receiving messages from
gecko fine.

Any ideas?

I can't - I don't have root privileges on gecko. But I have passed
your request on to Geoff (who is in the kitchen).

The use of 'overturn' in this context is somewhat anomalous.
Judgments are affirmed, set aside, vacated, or occasionally reversed.
It is convictions that are overturned; the term is rarely used with
noncriminal judgments.

I just spent all day writing software to track VTs.  I really am not
in the mood to consider modifying it at this time to do anything not
strictly required of me by the Rules.

I don't particularily want to have to keep track of all registered
Players.  Frankly, I trust that the Registrar is capable of doing that
adequately, and if I need to check to see if someone is registered, I
consider eir Report sufficient for my needs.  Your request would
compound my already tedious recordkeeping duties with additional work
which furthermore is already being performed by the Registrar.  I
don't see the point.

(The report generated by my software prior to the recent creation of
500 VTs and satisfaction of various Payment Orders was empty, as there
were no VTs for anyone to own.  Had I been in the mood for it, I might
have posted that Report.)

Why do you want every registered Player to appear in VT reports?  What
value does this have?

It is true that the TO failed (there weren't any VTs for Harlequin to
transfer), but I think a case might be made that the COE extended also
to the reason given for the refusal to record the satisfaction of the
POs.  My judgement would still hold in this case.

I think that should be a matter for the Appeals Court to decide. :)

Your choice of pronouns is amusing. Elde is male. And I believe it was
Blob's insistence on being treated as a gender-neutral entity that caused
the introduction of the Spivak pronouns in Nomic World in the first place
(before I joined, mind you.)

And occasionally in comp.mail.pine. Although I guess I can only get so far
as long as I am not actually a mail sysadmin, that still is enough to
bluff the others who are not mail sysadmins.


Vlad is subscribed twice:

C647100@MIZZOU1.missouri.edu
c647100@showme.missouri.edu

I suspect the former address is creating the problem.

A short SMTP conversation showed

My guess is that the MIZZOU1 server has been closed off for mail from the
outside, and now only serves outgoing mail, if any. Meanwhile, the other
address is sent to missouri.edu's main mail server: 

lie:~:$ host -t mx showme.missouri.edu
showme.missouri.edu     MX      0 mail.missouri.edu
lie:~:$ host -t mx missouri.edu
missouri.edu            MX      0 mail.missouri.edu

which one would definitely expect to work.

Greetings,
Oerjan.

Yes, Vlad suspected as much. I've unsubscribed the faulty address.

If a transfer is made to an entity heretofore unmentioned, an account

How does R1478 disagree? R1478 says nothing about Executors in Probate.

Depends what you mean by 'automatically' I agree it's not a concpetual
truth that Blob is eir own EiP. Rather, I rely on R1738's stipulation
that a Player's EiP is eir Executor. Granted, this can be read in two
ways. Usually, it means that, given that we know that an entity has an
EiP, then we know that the EiP is that entity's Executor. But I see
no reason why the provision cannot also apply to this different case,
where we know that a Player has an Executor (in this case, emself), and
so conclude that e is also eir own EiP.
