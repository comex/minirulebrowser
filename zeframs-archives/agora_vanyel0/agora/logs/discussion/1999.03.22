I notice that R1805 requires the CotC to publish these orders once
validated by a majority of the Board in order for them to become
effective.  Does this qualify?  I tend to think it doesn't.  Also,
Murphy validated my Appellate Orders for CFJ1119 already, but
they have not yet been published either.

I can understand that.  I don't think we can keep Wills without
keeping some sort of Probate system, although the current one is
clearly overweight.  Suggestions?

Allow the Notary to dispose of assets as e sees fit within the
general restriction that e must honor a Will to the maximum extent
possible, after first disposing of all debts.
Let the Courts decide if the Notary has done eir best
to follow this mandate (and allow it to rectify the situation if it
deems that e has not).

I will note that had not Chuck objected, I would have, on the grounds that
the Proposal is too substantial not to be put through a Vote.

I suspect that Scott may now also wish to put through his reformatting
Proposals this way.  I will not object to this, as long as the Proposals
do nothing more substantial than reformatting.

Greetings,

Were I to propose this, I would try to Adopt it Without Objection.

Protoproposal:

Rule 879 is amended as follows:

The text reading:

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

Is replaced by:

    Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if the number vote cast on
    that Proposal is greater than or equal to one-third of the number
    of currently Active Players not denied voting privileges who
    cast a vote on any proposal in the last two weeks, or one-fifth
    of all Players, whichever is greater.

Protoproposal Chaos243 [rev. 3]

Taxes, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      (a) The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Bank is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as
          the Bank's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute
          it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not
          do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      (c) If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for
          any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except
          when specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer
          Order), e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and
          upon conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]

I would Object - I see Quorum's basic purpose as a defense mechanism of
democracy against plutocracy, and so it should _definitely_ not be tied to
the number of Votes.

Nice in principle, but when only about 1/3 of Active players cast votes on a
given proposal batch, a single non-vote can kill a proposal, as I rudely
discovered. The point of quorum is also to allow a subset of players to
continue on when not everyone is present. When the votes cast is barely
greater than quorum, that secondary purpose isn't fulfilled.
