How stupid! Well, here we go again:

I take one Kudo from General Chaos for baseless Kudo transferring, which would
have gone to Morendil as the wronged party, were it not for the fact that
Morendil himself, in my opinion, should lose a Kudo for giving unnecessary
extra work to the Judge of his CFJ, would that Judge not agree with him,
but now will be transferred to Oerjan, who often shows to have a pleasant
and responsible way of playing Nomic.

Do tell! I know that if you reverse the numbers and read them as 3
squared,you get 9, and 23 is the ninth prime number. 23 is one of only two
numbers that cannot be expressed as the sum of eight or fewer cubes.
Append the aforementioned nine to the end and you get 239, the other such
number.

I wasn't aware of the existence of so many Contests--little
activity, eh? I therefore make the following requests.

--All Group Viziers currently recruiting please send me a copy of
your Ordinances and a mission statement.

--All Contestmasters currently searching for Contestants please send me a
copy of the Contest Rules.

(Since voting and proposing remain broken, there's not much else to do)

In any case, prohibitions against deregistering only apply to voluntary
deregistrations and Lawlessness, not to Absence.

And if you take the letters in the inscription on the Pope's tiara which 
correspond to Roman numerals and add them up, you get six hundred sixty 
six, a.k.a. six hundred three score and six.Isn't this fun. :)

Tell me, then, what is the procedure by which these entities are
deprived of their existence?  Doesn't Rule 1011 require a _procedure_
for doing this?

The procedure is (most of) the second paragraph of Rule 1579. It is not
customary to interpret 1011 as requiring a procedure to involve Player
action.

An idea I had while driving:

Right now, the Rules are the only governing law of this Game, and
Proposals only modify those Rules through imposing Rule Changes;
adopted Proposals are not binding in and of themselves.  This is, to
me, somewhat unintuitive, and is limitative on the power of Proposals.

I am beginning to think that the Rule Change/Proposal dichotomy that
we have created is unnecessary, and is, in part or in total, the
source of the abovementioned limitation.

Instead, I would suggest once again having adopted Proposals become
"Rules", but I would not call them by that name.  Instead, let us call
adopted Proposals Acts.  When a Proposal is adopted, it becomes a Act
and gains the full force of law.  Acts may be amended or repealed by
later Acts, of course; when a Act is amended, it governs from that
moment forth in its new form, and when it is repealed, it ceases to
govern at that time.

Now, what happens to the Rules?  They remain, but they are not the
root of the governance.  Rather, when a Act is enacted, the Rulekeepor
will be required to codify those portions of it which are laws (but
not those portions which are commands) into the Rules.  E must, within
a reasonable time (to be worked out later), announce eir codification
(the Without Objection procedure will work for this).  The purpose of
the codification is to make available a shorter, more organized form
of the law than that which would be afforded by the Record of Acts
(which will also contain all the acts amending prior acts, repealing
prior acts, and ordering people to do things on a one-time basis, none
of which belong in the Rules).  Note that the failure of the
Rulekeepor to act, or to act properly, does not deprive an Act of
value; it merely diminishes the value of the published Rules as a
record of the law.  Once the Assessor certifies a Proposal adopted, it
becomes an Act and is law.  The Record of Acts remains the final
authority; the published Rules are merely a convenience.

Of course, getting to what I have just described from where we are now
would be an exercise in legal gymnastics.  But it might be
interesting. :)

This sounds a lot like what I know of how US laws are enacted.

Or perhaps legal topology, since I doubt simple gymnastics will 
suffice :-)

There seems to be a trend towards poorly-thought out CFJs made on the 
spur of the moment; I'm not sure that's the best way to do things. A 
statement like this one, which is a) ambiguous and b) overgeneralized, 
with an argument that is essentially a rewording of the statement, is 
unfairly putting a burden on a judge, not to mention just being silly. 
IMHO.

Because there should not be any reason to CFJ on a fact that has been
regularly used in the game since its inception.

Your Statement is so vague that it wouldn't even resolve the question I
and Scott were discussing.

No one doubts that the Rules derive their authority from the General Will
of all the Players. What is in question is whether the Rules can determine
events to happen without designating a Player message to initiate the
change. Years and years of automatic Currency Transfers makes this a
moot question: of course the Rules have this power.

Your argument, while factually correct, has no implication on the truth of
the Statement. Derived agency is as valid as any other.

Ørjan.

I bought my own copy of _Le Ton beau de Marot_ last night and starting
reading it straight away. Now, how am I going to come up with my own
translation of "Ma Mignonne"?

I think the very severability of the provisions ensures that this
cannot happen. If a Proposal contains a bunch of severable provisions
which are individually clear but together cause paradox, then how can
R594 justify bringing them down in a group while maintaining their
alleged severability?

Your tenacity is to be admired, Scott, if not your argument. I would
have thought that someone as fond as you are of wheeling out Occam's
Razor to wield against opponents in argument would have thought twice
about making such a blatantly ad hoc revision of your view to avoid
a devastating objection. The attractions of the atomic view, such as
they are, will in no way be enhanced by making a special case for
Rule Changes just in order to be able to explain, post hoc, the events
surrounding the amendment of R1551 by P3445.

In any case, the ad hoc manoeuvre you suggest is unwarranted. Even
if Rule Changes are special, why should the *number* of them be
special?

You can't evade the force of my arguments by pretending not to
understand them. We both know you're smarter than that :)

I think it's the model that Suber assumes in the Initial Ruleset,
which we have since eschewed, in my opinion, wrongfully, based on an
inadequate understanding of the difference between Rules as enacted
Proprosals and Rules as the codification of law.  The similarity with
American federal practice is probably because Suber is American, and
also because the American practice derives from British
parliamentarian practice, which is pervasive in deliberative bodies in
English-speaking countries.

Well, one Justice, elJefe, has delivered Judgement; I've seen nothing
from Andre yet and Calabresi's eligibility is before the Courts. So
the result of the Appeal is not yet settled.

I'll try to have a look at it. Things have been pretty hectic around
here for that last week or so! (My apologies to Chuck, who solicited
comments on CFJ 944, but received none, at least from me. He raised
some interesting points that I would have like to have time to think
about, but the arguments surrounding the Appeal of CFJ 933 have taken
all my attention.)

I doubt you will get many Players to agree that this is the case. 
Your views about Player and Rule agency are the most radical of any
Player here, and while those views make for interesting metaphysics,
they do not reflect anything like actual game custom, which does
grant the Rules agency to create and destroy Currencies, or more
generally, Entities,  without the actions of Players.

But since, if he names no-one, he is deemed to have named the Speaker,
is permitted to resign, since he is deemed to have named the Speaker
to succeed him.

Well, strictly speaking, establishing game custom as being against
the atomic view was all I was trying to achieve, at least insofar
as the Appeal of CFJ 933 is concerned, so I'm happy with that. I
have other, more general objections to adopting the atomic view
as a model of how Proposals should be applied (as opposed to how
thay have been applied), having to do with its treatment of
conflicting amendments, but that's a different argument.

It has always been game custom to regard provisions in Rules like
"Currency X is destroyed" as establishing their own procedures.
You yourself recently argued as much when you distinguished between
matters of fact and matters of law.

But then he would have named someone, and that clause doesn't apply.

I don't see how you can claim that the number of amendments is a formal
property of the Proposal in question aking to the number of words it
contains. Given the same text, Michael and I are certain to agree on
how many words it contains; we can disagree about how many amendments
it contains by appealing to different intuitions about what counts as
an amendment, or more generally what it takes for the game to held to
be in, or have been in, a certain state.

If you want to view it that way, you may; it's not obligatory. That
clause wouldn't apply, but now the first one would, and he would have
named the Speaker, and so be permitted to resign.

In my view the effect of the Rule is first to recognize the failure
to appoint a successor, and then to make it the case that things proceed
just as if the Speaker had been appointed.

The number of amendments can be open to argument without removing their
status as a formal property. In the same way, the number of words in the
sentence "I have 4 over-bollixed unicorns in my formlches this a.m." might
be debated in some circles.

Please. The statement, taken in the context of the current discussion, is
neither ambiguous nor overgeneralized. It may not be true in the form it
is generalized; that is what is being debated. As to the lack of
arguments, I am submitting this CFJ on behalf of the debaters, and do not
particularly want to take a side at this point.

"valid?" perhaps. I didn't claim the Rules weren't valid. But if Bill

that doesn't make the die President of the United Stated.

Shall we formerly open the debate?  I'm tempted to jump in here with a

It may not be ambiguous in the context of your current discussion; but 
the general statement "The Rules lack agency" *is* ambiguous. A CFJ is 
not judged in the context of any discussion; it is judged on the truth or 
falsity of the statement. "The Rules lack agency"; agency for what? To do 
what? To change the Game State? That's not what it says. To compel 
players to take certain actions? That's not what it says either. I stand 
by my statement.

My own view is that, although the intention of R108 was to
prohibit *Rules* from having retroactive effect (in the Initial
Set, the distinction between Rules and Rule Changes is not made as
clearly as we now make it), its current language refers only to
retroactive Rule Changes, and so is much weaker in what it can
prevent. It can prevent Rule Changes from creating Rules in the past,
but that may be all. If a Rule Change enacted a Rule stating that
Oerjan is to be deemed to have been On Hold for a particular two month
period last year (say March 1 to May 1 1996), then I don't think that
R108 could stop the Rule from being enacted.

I agree that we should distinguish the designation from any effects
the designation would have, with only the latter being possibly
retroactive. In the present case, the issue comes down to whether
we count Votes cast while the Rule was still infected as having been
cast during the VP, once the disinfection has occurred. If we count
such Votes as legally cast, this is a retroactive application of the
newly disinfected R693, but it is not a retroactive Rule Change and
therefore not prohibited by R108.

Does anyone here know how to get elm to include the date aswell as
the name of the author in its attribution string? I tried changing
the attribution setting in the elmrc to:

attribution = On %d, %s wrote:

but %d produced a meaningless large number, and what's more caused
%s to return the value (null).

Advice gratefully received,

The fact that one is simply determinable, while another is not,
says nothing about whether each property is epiphenomenal or
not.  If I don't know your birthdate, and have no easy way
of finding it out, then I can only guess at your age, but that
doesn't make it any less an epiphenomenal property.

I did get it in on time.  I haven't seen it published yet, so
I'll give a brief summary of my arguments here.

I judged it TRUE.

I argued that there was a Game Custom that R108 prohibits
Rule Changes from indirect as well as direct retroactive
effects, thus preventing Rules from having retroactive
effect.  However, I don't know how strong this cusom
is, as I can't recall any past CFJs which have turned on
this point, and this may just be my intuition.  I also
commented, though, that this issue was irrelevant to this
CFJ due to my finding on the second issue:

That was my finding and the basis for my ruling TRUE.

So if you submit the CFJ "Vlad committed the Crime of Silly CFJ
submission", I have a ready defense. Vlad who? Vlad the Impaler? Vlad
Jones? The statement is ambiguous.

Vlad

So 1069 as it is works, but if it said, "The Amendment Number
of a Rule is incremented each time the Rule is amended," it would
not?  Seems like a distinction without a difference to me.

Even if we accept your argument (which I do not), two questions:
1. How does one go about destroying VTs?
2. What makes each person responsible for destroying eir own VTs?
Your other arguments seem to say that all Players equally share
responsibility in the case of underspecified obligations; why
the limitation here?  Isn't Steve as guilty of not destroying
my VTs as I am?
