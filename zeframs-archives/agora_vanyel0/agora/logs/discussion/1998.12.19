I did say it was an attempt. ;) Yours is a contrived example, though.
We could argue that such knowledge is extrinsic; the answer to the 
question can be found at any time by looking it up in an encyclopedia.
I meant the phrase 'knowledge about events' to refer to in-game events,
although of course that's a risky phrase to use too...

I should note that I in no way disagree with Chuck here.  The Rules
can readily retrospectively change the interpretation of past acts,
almost without limit.  However, I believe it is a reasonable position
that the interpretation of past events should not be changed as a
consequence of a Rule Changes except as absolutely necessary.
Usually, this means only as explicitly required.

I think the distinction you are seeking to make is utterly irrelevant.
