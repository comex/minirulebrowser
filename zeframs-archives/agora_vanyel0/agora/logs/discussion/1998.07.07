Given our VT-scarce environment and the fact that we can only distribute
three (at the moment) proposals, while the Repeal-O-Matic spits out one
every week, I would suggest that we make one of several possible changes:

1) Reduce the frequency of ROM proposals to, say, twice or even once a month.
2) Instead of a proposal, have a special ROM referendum for each proposed
repeal. This way, more of the ROM repeals are likely to get passed (if that
is indeed what we desire...)
<<

But why is that necessary? I'd say that at the moment the proposal
queue mechanism is doing a splendid job - it keeps the R-O-M proposals
around without wasting any game resources, and only proposals that get
some initial support are distributed. So where is the problem?

It doesn't seem that way to me, necessarily.  The phrase parses two different
ways.  It could be 'Voting Tokens per (Player in circulation)' or '(Voting
Tokens per Player) in circulation'.  Obviously the first parsing can be
ignored, since 'Player in circulation' is undefined.  But in the second parsing
it is ambiguous whether the 'in circulation' is redundant (since 'Voting Tokens
per Player' are, by the definition, 'in circulation') or is meant to qualify
only 'Voting Tokens' (giving it your intended meaning).  It would have been
unambiguous if the Rule said 'Voting Tokens in circulation per Player'.

Having said that, I am not going to fight too hard on this, since it seems
pretty much of a toss up to me.  If no one else considers my interpretation to
be the more natural one, then I will be glad to recalculate the VTPP and levy a
new tax.  I'll wait till Thursday to see what others think.  If I haven't seen
any support for my interpretation, I will levy the tax at that time.  Steve, I
hope that is acceptable to you.

It has become my impression that the right to go safely on Hold has lately
been compromised.

I am thinking here about the interaction between Taxes and Debt, which
makes it quite possible to be hit, when going Off Hold, by Persistent
Indebtedness for POs that didn't exist when you went On Hold.

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I'll have to double-check, but I though Kolja amended the PI Rule so that you would not get hit by it while you are On Hold (although I think you might still get hit for one Blot when you come Off Hold if the PO becomes overdue while you are On Hold).

I know that.  But the Taxation Rules imply that you can be hit by that
Blot _even if you pay all your debts before going On Hold._

We may have to refer the question of whether R1445 confers a special
right or privilege on the Speaker to the Courts. But even assuming that
it does, I'm curious to know why you think that the language of R1445
can only confer such a right on the Player who is Speaker at the time
the Election results are announced. I can find nothing in R1445 that
obviously implies this, and it would seem sensible to me to interpret
the Rule as conferring this right on whichever Player happened to be
Speaker, period, in the case where a Speaker Transition has occurred
after the results are announced, but before the prior Speaker has made
any determination.
