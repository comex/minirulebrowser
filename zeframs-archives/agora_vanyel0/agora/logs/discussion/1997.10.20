Indeed! And as recent events have shown, we aren't even playing with
a meta-rule to the effect that a person's consent is a necessary
precondition on their registration as a Player.

I don't see how that helps. If I had to Judge the question, I would
rule that this still imposes a requirement on non-Players who wish
to register.

This is exactly what I've been arguing for -- that the rules have 
authority over a certain "sphere of influence" involving the game of 
Nomic, and that even non-Players can be bound by these Rules. When the 
person tries to register, e enters the sphere, and is bound by the Rules. 
Am I saying that once e tries to register, a Rule requiring em to commit 
suicide would be binding? Of course not. The person's *registration* is 
within the sphere; eir committing suicide is not. Now once a person 
becomes a *Player*, they become much more encompassed in that sphere. 
Enough for a rule to require suicide? I don't know.

I don't see how. R451 applies only to considering the truth of CFJ
Statements, not to Appeals of Injunctions.

I find this baffling. Your hypothetical examples seem to me to be
even more clearly many Injunctions than Morendil's.

It's not immediately clear to me why Rule 113 is relevant: it only
says that Players always have the right to deregister rather than
continue to play. In what way does this assume that the Rules only
impose obligations on Players?

For the first three paragraphs, yes, and 21 for the last one.

You're entitled to it, according to the Rules:

Rule 1575/0 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.


Since Misrepresentation is a Crime, the evidence must be sufficient
to convict you beyond reasonable doubt.

I think a reasonable interpretation of R1497 would have to say
that in order to break it you have to actually believe, at the time
you post it, that what you are posting is false. I don't think that's
clear enough in this case.

We may be drifting from the point here. Yes, such a Rule may not be
obeyed. Rules are frequently not obeyed. The question is: does a
Player who breaks this Rule have any legal recourse not available
to someone who breaks any other Rule? I don't think appeal to a
meta-game principle is available.

I note that it is Vir's responsibility, as caller of the CFJ, to

Rule 908.

An interesting argument, but one which IMHO falls short of being 
quite convincing. Rule 663 states :

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, yours is an argument that 1736 conflicts with 663, which 
unfortunately (or fortunately, depending) takes precedence. If it is 
legal to issue one Injunction requiring one or more Players to issue 
one Payment Order, then it is legal to issue one Injunction requiring 
one or more Players to issue one or more Payment Orders.

They do too. They say that of all Players, exactly one must be the
Speaker. Thus, whenever a non-Player becomes the Speaker, that
non-Player perforce becomes a Speaker. At least that's how I
currently read the complex interplay of high-Power and low-Power
Rules regarding the identities of Players and Speaker.

That allegation would be, as far as I can determine, false.

There doesn't have to be a reason. Tainting the Speaker is a decision 
of the Playerhood, taken by Referendum; it has nothing to do, I 
think, with the truth or falsity of an allegation that the Speaker is 
Tainted.

This is apparently no longer the case, I refer you to the landmark
decision in the matter of how POs should be phrased. Recent Game
Custom seems to mandate that utterances of Players are to be
interpreted not as strictly literally as was the custom in older
times, but with a view to the underlying Rules that lend such
utterances legal import.

A more recent example is the D'Amato (sp?) law, which has been
extensively criticized precisely on the grounds that it seeks to
prohibit non-US businesses from concluding contracts with certain
countries inimical to the US. 

My opinion on the issue is that a body of law, be it the laws of a 
real-world nation or the Rules of Agora, is an instrument that a 
community of persons use to regulate some aspects of their lives. If 
such a community sees a natural and compelling interest in regulating 
actions of persons outside of the community, and has the means to 
enforce such regulations, why should there be any problem with using 
that same body of law to express such regulations ?

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Simplify Speaker Transition

We have an archaic three-way handshake still in the Rules, but it is
usually bypassed.  This would abolish it.

###

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 402 be amended to read

      Whenever the identity of the Speaker changes, the Registrar shall as
      soon as possible announce that this has happened, and the identity
      of the new Speaker, in the Public Forum.

{The public announcement is really the only remaining advantage of the
old system.}

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Installation into Office

An old idea from the aftermath of the Immunity crisis, that I never got
around to protoing: a way to elect Officers without knowing the identity
of any current Officers.

###

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Installation
into Office", reading

      There is a type of Application known as an Application to Install.
      Such an Application is Executed by posting it to the Public Forum
      stating that one is doing so.  For an Application to Install to
      take effect, when Executed:

      * it must state that it is an Application to Install;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Office and one Player to
        which it applies;

      * the number of Senators whose signatures it bears must exceed
        the number of Senators whose signatures it does not bear; and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When an Application to Install takes effect, the Player it
      identifies immediately starts to hold the Office to which it
      applies.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Abolish Months

Calendar months, being of inconsistent duration, are not suitable for
specifying periods of time.  Also, some things are unnecessarily dependent
on the beginning of the month.

###

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1676 ("Grace Period for New Players")
be amended by replacing the text "12 months" with "52 weeks", and by
replacing the text "ends two months afterwards" with "ends eight weeks
later".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1043 ("Deregistration") be amended
to read

      A Voter may deregister by sending a message to the Public Forum
      saying e is doing so.  A Voter who deregisters in this fashion
      cannot reregister in the following two weeks, any Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1556 ("Terms of Service for Offices")
be amended by replacing the text "on the first day of the fourth month
following the month in which" with "fifteen weeks after".

{15 week ToS plus ~2 week Election makes a cycle of ~17 weeks, which is
very close to the current 4 months.}

Be it further resolved that Rule 1717 ("The Senate") be amended by
replacing the text "two months" with "eight weeks".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1498 ("Winning by Blots") be amended
by replacing the text "three months" with "twelve weeks".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1622 ("Forfeiting the Game") be amended
by replacing the text "three months" with "twelve weeks".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") be amended by
replacing the text "a month" with "four weeks".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1062 ("Kudos and Honour") be amended by
replacing each occurrence of the text "three months" with "twelve weeks".

Be it further resolved that Rule 1377 ("The Herald") be amended by
replacing the text "three months" with "twelve weeks".

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Fix Absence

Fixes the bug recently discovered.  Makes the terminology nicer (`Quiet'
is borrowed from Steve).  Gets rid of the Abandoning state, as Steve
suggested.

###

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1042 ("Deregistration due to Absence")
be amended to read

      Each Player is exactly one of Present, Quiet or Absent.  This status
      is known as a Player's Presence.  When a Player registers, e
      becomes Present.  Whenever an Active Player posts to the Public
      Forum, e becomes Present.

      Any Player can cause any particular Active Present Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for eight weeks, e becomes Absent.

      Any Player can cause any Absent Player to be deregistered by
      stating that e is doing so in the Public Forum.  If this happens,
      the Registrar shall as soon as possible announce such in the
      Public Forum.

      If this Rule requires the Speaker to be deregistered, then,
      immediately before e is deregistered, e commits the Class A Crime
      of Speaker Abandonment, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker
      immediately.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Fork

favor's old idea, updated to use Applications (which seem a particularly
appropriate mechanism for this).

###

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "The Fork",
reading

      The Fork Depth of Agora is 0.

      There is a type of Application known as an Application to Fork,
      the purpose of which is to create a new nomic.  Such an Application
      is Executed by posting it to the Public Forum stating that one is
      doing so.  For an Application to Fork to take effect, when Executed:

      * it must state that it is an Application to Fork;

      * it must clearly identify a name for the nomic to be created,
        which cannot be "Agora";

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When an Application to Fork takes effect, a new nomic is created.
      The new nomic's game state, including all game history, is an
      exact duplicate of Agora's game state at that time, except:

      * Players of Agora whose signatures the Application does not
        bear are not Players;

      * all instances of the characters "Agora", including quoted
        instances, in the text of the Rules, are changed by replacing
        "Agora" with the name of the new nomic;

      * the number at the end of the first sentence of this Rule is
        incremented by 1;

      * any other changes clearly specified in the Application;

      * the effects of the Application, rather than to create a new nomic,
        were to make all the above changes to the game state.

Be it further resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Sharing the
Public Forum", reading

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, any message in the Public
      Forum has no effect if either:

      * it states clearly that it pertains only to a specific set of
        nomics, of which Agora is not a member; or

      * it does not state clearly to which nomics it pertains, and
        "Agora" is not the reverse of "arogA".

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Revise Activity

AI=2 required.

###

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself on Hold")
have its Title changed to "Activity", and be amended to read

      Each Player is exactly one of Active or Inactive.  This status
      is known as a Player's Activity.  When a Player registers, e
      becomes Active.

      A Player can change eir Activity by posting a message to the
      Public Forum stating unambiguously eir desired Activity.  A
      Player cannot change from being Inactive to being Active in this
      way unless e has been Inactive for the entirety of the preceding
      4 days.

      "On Hold" is a synonym for "Inactive", and "Off Hold" is a
      synonym for "Active".

{Legislates the traditional terminology of "Active" and "Inactive".
The "Hold" terminology is retained for convenience.  Also gets rid
of the dependence on Movement -- it is inconvenient for all involved,
and only increases uncertainty in the game state.}

Be it further resolved that Rule 1023 ("Definition of "As Soon As
Possible"") be amended by replacing the paragraph reading

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

with

      This Rule defers to Rules which impose different requirements on
      the timing of Official Duties.

{The part being removed is redundant with Rule 1584.}

Maybe it's time to implement something I've been considering: Archivist,
like Distributor, should not be an Office, and should not be limited to
current Players.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: Fix Lawlessness

We shouldn't be deregistering people for Blots that may not be legal,
or that they haven't had a chance to clear.

###

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") be amended by
replacing the paragraph

      A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than 30 Blots.

with

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that number
      of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than
      30 Overdue Blots.

I am opposed to this. The inconsistent duration of months is exactly why
it is better to use months than weeks for any period of more than 2-3
weeks or so. Example:

3 months after February 3, 1998 is
(March, April)
May 3, 1998.

12 weeks after February 3, 1998 is
(Lesse, 12*7 = 84 days,
February 87
- 28 (not a leap year) =
March 59
- 31 =
April 28, 1998.

Don't you try telling me weeks are more convenient.

Greetings,
rjan.

Agreed.  Months are a natural unit of time, even if they are of
irregular length.  I don't need a calender to tell that March 1st is
three months after December 1st, but I do need one to tell that March
1st is 12 weeks after December 7th (or December 8th, if it's a leap
year).

Custom is that "is deregistered" refers to becoming deregistered, rather
than being in a state of not being registered.  I think Morendil is
still in Office.

Not good enough.  Morendil had enough Votes to win before e was
deregistered.  Unless you intend it to be retroactive.

I have another idea of how to fix this.  We could have a Rule defining
that Players, and only Players, are eligible to hold each Office.  Other
Rules then modify this: the Speaker is not eligible to be Speaker-Elect
or CotC, etc.  The Rule defining eligibility states that if an Office
would ever be held by someone ineligible for that Office, the Office is
instead filled by the Order of Succession.  To make things really neat,
Speaker can become an Office; if the Order of Succession starts "Speaker,
Speaker-Elect" then this one Rule will cover the present bug, Speaker
succession, ineligibility, removal from Office, and default Officers,
all in one go.  Worthwhile, I think.

Please, not another step in the deregistration.  My original draft
of the current Absence Rule had Players deregistered as soon as they
became Absent; the extra step of a Player actually having to point it
out was added to make it impossible to be unaware of a deregistration
for Absence.  If someone incorrectly alleges Absence, it's not at all
difficult to check.

No, that's precisely the way it was bothering me.  Now when the Registrar
reports "Players X, Y and Z are Absent", it also has this effect on
their status.  Let's separate reporting and changing of status completely.

No it does not.  One alleges that a Player "has Abandoned the Game",
which is a term completely distinct from each possible status.

My proposed fix (protoed today) does away with all this alleging business,
and makes these changes of status completely explicit, which I think is
vastly preferable and a lot less confusing than the current Rule seems
to be for some people.

Apart from that terminology issue, it looks like our independently
generated versions of this Rule are effectively identical.

I can say with some certainty that they are.  List traffic passes, in the
clear, through enough major backbones that it would be most surprising
if it never passed a CIA tap.  Whether this discussion contains enough
keywords to actually alert a human is, however, another matter.

Well, how about the following meta-rules, which have taken precedence
over the Rules

"Errors whose correction is impossible or impractible shall not be
corrected"

"Rules which have undesirable consequences (Walrus Marks & Black Repeals)
shall be ignored or obfuscated until they can be rendered ineffective"

The phrase "deregister rather than continue to play" implies that
deregistration absolves one of all the paraphernalia of playing, including
Rule-imposed obligations.

1998-02-03 == 1998-W06-2

12 weeks later is simply 1998-W18-2.

I would prefer to be using weeks for these things, and as Registrar I'm
most directly affected by most of these changes.

We don't use it most of the time.  It requires some Rule analysis on

I will be annoyed if I have to figure out when 1998-W18-2 is in normal 
calendar terms just to know when the deadline is for something.

It's only a one-off calculation!  I can't believe you're all incapable
of a little date arithmetic.  These week calculations are all trivially
automatable, and, as has just been demonstrated, not even particularly
difficult to do by hand.  And I get to do most of it anyway.  Surely the
representational convenience of months must be outweighed by their
inherent unfairness and poor arithmetic properties?

Wow! I have about twice as many P-Notes as everyone else put together.

Oh no. This will _not_ work. You are forgetting an important paragraph 
of Rule 1599:

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it.

I think this should be considered a bug in 1599 - clearly required
vacations should be exempted.

OK, not many of us are very aware of the passing of weeks.  But I've
found that, now that I'm employed, I'm very aware of weeks, rather than
months, and whereas I have to look at my watch to tell you it's 1997-10-20
(20th of October 1997), I know immediately that it's 1997-W43-1 (Monday
of week 43 of 1997).

So the rest of you can forget about that.  It's only an issue of
representation.  The fact remains that arithmetic with months is
fundamentally meaningless, and whatever rules one invents for it will
have a number of odd effects.  (E.g., (1 month later than (1 month
later than X)) is not necessarily the same as (2 months later than X).)
Those things that use periods of months would obviously be preferable
making all such periods the same length.  And as for the "beginning of the
fourth month following" business with Offices, that's just unnecessarily
clumping Elections together.

Doh!  I suppose we shall have to play games with opposite TOs, or require
a different Player to vacate.  Hmm... what if the Heraldship were to
change hands between the two parts of the Rule taking effect?

Inherent unfairness is debatable.

Your claim of representational convenience is erroneous, however.  You
would force us to use a nonstandard and unfamiliar calendar to save
you the trouble of using a standard one.

Maybe I'm just a bit oldfashioned or lazy, but I'd prefer not to make
such "small calculations" all the time. I think the "inherent

players in exactly the same way (maybe with the exception of grace
periods, but again I don't think these two or three days really

Perhaps because I am self-employed and have to do more monthly tasks
(inventory, P&L, etc.) than weekly tasks, I am more aware of months
than of weeks.

Strangely enough, this bothers me not at all.  I can't see any use for
computing a date one month later than one month later than a given
date.

I happen to like having elections clumped together.

Probably the easiest thing would be for me to delegate the Heraldship just long
enough to get the POs vacated.

There is no explicit provision to avoid the installation of players
who are on hold. Bug or feature? (Note that 1555 only fires when an

No I would not, and not for that reason.  No one would be forced to
represent dates in the week-based fashion I demonstrated.  (It's just
convenient for anyone that happens to be familiar with it.)  The `claim' I
made concerning representational convenience was simply an admission that
periods of months are more convenient in the usual date representations.

As for "saving [me] the trouble of using a standard one", I *do* use
the standard date representation, and would continue to do so.  In fact,
as all dates in the Registrar's Report are in the year-month-day form,
it would actually be more convenient for me in this respect to continue
using periods of months.  The real reason for switching to periods of
weeks (or days, for that matter) is simply that periods of months are
a very bad idea when any precision is required.

I'm not sure this is a real problem, but I have a vague feeling that a
sentence like       

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

might keep rules from having wanted retroactive effects (I mean that
the _rule_ has such an effect, not the _introduction_ of the rule),
just because some other, unrelated parts of the rule have been
changed. Can any of the veterans assure me that this is not really a
problem?

Hmph.  There are plenty of cases where two Rule-mandated periods run
back-to-back (or nearly so), so I'd rather like to be able to perform
meaningful arithmetic on dates.  And maybe it's just the hacker showing
through, but I find these specifications of periods of months intensely
ugly.  They are, in hacker jargon, evil.

Then Propose to hold Elections for all Offices every fourth month,
rather than having them split into four groups.

Feature, I guess.  I didn't consider the possibility; I think anything
purporting to fix this Officer On Hold problem ought to fix it for
Installation too.  (Perhaps I can explain some of my aesthetics here:
anything that would fix the Officer On Hold problem for the current
Ruleset, but would then be circumvented by an Application to Install,
is as far as I'm concerned not a proper fix.  The Rules ought to
really enforce the concept of "each Officer must be an Active Player",
rather than just plugging the gaps that can make this condition false.
As there are potentially many ways of becoming an Officer, it should
not be necessary for each mechanism to separately ensure the integrity
of the Officer system.)

I would prefer something along the lines of "If any person
attempts to register without first having deposited $US20 in the
bank account of Agora Inc., such attempt is without effect."
Thus we sidestep the whole argument.

Why is everyone acting like I'm trying to change the calendar?

To clarify my earlier remarks: the "1998-W06-2" date representation is
merely an alternative representation of normal Gregorian calendar dates,
mandated by ISO 8601.  It happens to be quite convenient when dealing
with weeks, but IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.  Please just forget I posted
about it, as everyone is only misinterpreting it.

All I want to do is make Rule-mandated time periods have consistent
duration.

You really think 'repealing' a set of Rules by creating a Rule with a 
power fractionally above theirs is aesthetically pleasing? :)

Of course, if we wanted to reinstate them, it'd be easy -- just pass 
another Rule with Power 3.15. :)

We *already* have precision.  Official Reports routinely report times to a
precision of one second, and have done, AFAICT, for the entire lifetime
of Agora.  (Official Reports routinely report the wrong timestamp,
but that's a different issue.)  Given that we use such precision, and
often *require* precision of a few minutes in order to resolve events,
shouldn't we have these time periods last a meaningful number of seconds?

I understand.  My remark was meant to be a comment about the opposition that
your proposal was generating, not about the merits of it.  8)  Actually I am
sympathetic to your idea, although I must admit I don't really have strong
feelings about it one way or the other.

It's not ideal.  If I were slightly less pissed off I'd do it properly,
but it'd be a time consuming job.  And, aesthetically, I find this sort of
`patch' -- which is neat, self-contained and unobtrusive -- a lot less
objectionable than many bodges currently in the Ruleset.

Aesthetically, I do not like the typo, however.

While this does indeed sidestep the argument, it is not a natural way
to phrase the desired regulation.  The purpose of the law is shrouded
in unnecessarily convoluted semantics, used not for any reason of
substance, but merely to do homage to a particular convention of
style.

Learn to read; I haven't said anything inconsistent.

I like having several elections at once, but I don't want the entire
Officerate (is that a word?) rolling over at the same time.

No shit.  (That "-Reply" business, btw, is contrary to the relevant RFCs.
Novell fucked up big time.)

Actually, I suspect (but haven't checked) that I'm the only Officer
so far to routinely use the correct timestamp, so you're hardly a
"major offender".  Anyway, let's look at the headers of your message:

The "Date:" header indicates the time you originated the message, and is
of no legal consequence.  The "Received:" headers are what are relevant --
each system to process the message adds one to the top of the message.
A message to the PF becomes legally effective at the time it "reaches
the Public Forum" (CFJ 831, IIRC -- check with the FLR).  I interpret
this as meaning the time it reached the mailing list.  The interesting
headers are:

>Received: (from majordomo@localhost)
>	by gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au (8.8.5/8.8.5) id DAA12476
>	for agora-discussion-list; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 03:23:59 +1000

>	for <agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>; Tue, 21 Oct 1997 03:23:50 +1000

The lower of these -- the earlier one -- records the message arriving at
gecko, and the second it leaving.  It reached the list software somewhere
between these, most likely immediately after the earlier timestamp.
I therefore use this header -- the first "Received:" line added by the
machine hosting the mailing list.

It seems perfectly natural to me.  It's how I'd write it.

It's not merely a "convention of style" -- there are real semantic
differences, which are precisely why it is relevant to this discussion.

Gee, two Senators, no requirement for public posting until the acutal
Execution--that's not scammable at all.

How about using the referendum/election mechanism instead?

Yes, and when Steve was Assessor, he didn't like fractional VTs;
but we've kept them anyway.  An Officer, IMO, is entitled to
some consideration as to how e would like Rules affecting em
to be, but such consideration is not unlimited.

Unfairness to whom?  If its only to the months themselves, I'm

I can't believe you're incapable of a little date arithmetic.  These
month calculations are all trivially automatable, and, as has just been
demonstrated, not even particularly difficult to do by hand.

There is, I believe, an old Judgement that the "Date:" header is the

I don't care one whit about fractional VTs, for what it's worth. :)

Well, I don't know one offhand, that's the problem. But I mean a
situation where a rule somehow has a retroactive effect, and is
supposed to have it. 

The proto, as it stands now, would then deny effects of such a rule
that apply before the date of the last change of the rule, even if the
change had nothing to do with the wanted retroactive effect.

I don't know how to check whether rules with such wanted retroactive
effects exist, but instead of searching through the whole rule set I
thought I'd ask you if any of you can think of an example offhand, or
feel sure that there are no such rules.

Sorry if this is too vague - if you feel that's so, just ignore me ;)

Unfortunately, I can't give an exact quote.  I noticed it about a week back
and again a few days ago.  The second time was in a reply you made to Steve
on the issue of these Injunctions.  You wrote "a Injunctions .....
is....".  I'm afraid I can't be more specific than that since I haven't been
keeping a log of the discussion.

Hope this helps.

It wouldn't be if the Referendum passed. It's probably a moot point,
though. I think you'd be deregistered for Lawlessness again before
any of this had a chance to happen.

The Speaker can become Tainted in various ways. One of them is by
passage of the appropriate Referendum.

More than just terminology is borrowed from my Proposal; my whole approach
to the question has been basically copied. Our Proposals are nearly
identical. I claim priority.

'Present' is already used in the Ruleset, as in declaring Presence on
a Proposal. That's why I used 'Here'.
