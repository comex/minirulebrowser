I have no interest in doing this "as an experiment".

I might support this as a limited-term experiment with appropriate
sunset clauses, but I would not support it like this.  I think
our current economy, flawed though it may be, is the most
interesting thing we have right now, and I'd like to keep it.

What do you suggest we replace the economy with?  Trinkets
and frivolous games, as some nomics do?  No thank you.  I *like*
playing in "the serious nomic."

I'm not sure if this will have the desired effect.  However, as long
as you make sure your Rule Titles correspond correctly with their
Numbers, I won't have to make that determination.

One thing I'd like to see is compulsory public *proposing*.  I think
this might increase P-Note expenditure, as it gives Players more
of an opportunity to prevent proposals from being distributed by
decreasing their priority.  Along with it, I would make changes
in priority also required to be public.

Which gives me an idea: what if we increase P-Note and VT influx
to much larger (but still limited) levels, and allow unlimited
expenditure of VTs on Proposals?  Would people be interested in
trying this for a trial period?  If so, I'll try to find the time
to write up a proto (but probably not until next week).

Interesting, but very, very dangerous. Which might not be an argument
against it...:)

Protoproposal Chaos35 [rev. 2]

Restore Sanity

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

[This Proposal does not seek to eradicate either Voting Tokens or
 P-Notes; it merely removes them from having any role in the process
 of making or voting upon Proposals.  I will leave it for later to
 decide what should be done with the Currencies themselves.]

Be it hereby resolved, that Rule 206 ["Voting Entities and Votes"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Each Player is entitled to cast at most one Vote upon each 
          Proposal.  

      (b) A Player may be deprived of the right to cast a Vote upon
          any one Proposal, or upon Proposals generally, by the Rules
          or by an Order issued pursuant to the Rules.

      (c) No entity other than a Player may cast Votes upon
          Proposals. 

      (d) The term "Voting Entity" is hereby declared to be synonymous
          with "Player", except where such construction would clearly
          not make sense.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 ["The Cost of Voting"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1765 ["Attributing Additional
      Votes"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 683 be amended to read:

      (a) A Player casts a vote upon a Proposal by sending a message to
          the Assessor specifying the Vote e is casting and the Proposal
          upon which it is cast.  

      (b) A vote cast under this Rule must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or
          ABSTAIN, or an obvious synonym thereof.

      (c) Any attempt by a Player to cast a vote is void and without
          legal effect if: 
|       (1) the attempt is made other than during the Voting Period of
|           the Proposal in question,
        (2) the Player attempting to cast a Vote is barred from
            Voting upon that Proposal by the Rules or by an Order then
            in effect barring em from doing so, 
        (3) the Player attempting to cast a Vote has previously cast a
            vote (other than a vote made void by this subrule) upon
            that Proposal, or
        (4) the attempt violates, or if allowed would violate, this or
            any other Rule.

      (d) Votes, once cast according to this Rule, cannot be
          retracted, cancelled, or changed except when the Rules
          require it, and then only as required by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1715 ["Announcing One's Presence"]
      be repealed.  [Presence is irrelevant with free voting.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1449 ["The Assessor"] be amended to
      read:

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor shall
      receive a weekly salary equal to the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1824 ["Debt Voting"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1660 ["The Speaker's Vote"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1760 ["Quorum Buyback"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1723 ["Sanity"] be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1724 ["Urgent Proposals"] be
      repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1036 ["The Proposal Queue"] be
      amended, by replacing the word "zero" with "one" wherever it
      appears. 

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1771 ["Increasing Priority"] be
      amended to read:

      (a) Not more than once in any Nomic Week, each Player may select
          any one Proposal in the Proposal Queue and may increase or
          decrease the priority of that Proposal by one, by sending a
          message to the Promotor indicating the Proposal to be
          affected and whether that Proposal's priority is to be
          increased or decreased.

      (b) An attempt to change the Priority of a Proposal in the
          Proposal Queue shall be void and without legal effect if:
        (1) the Player who attempted it has already changed the
            priority of any Proposal during the same Nomic Week;
        (2) the attempt relates to a Proposal which is no longer in
            the Proposal Queue; or
        (3) the change attempted would result in the Proposal having a
            priority less than zero.

      (c) The Promotor and the Speaker shall each be permitted to
|         exercise the right given by subrule (a) of this Rule twice
|         in each week, instead of once.  However, if the same Player
|         is both Promotor and Speaker, e may not exercise this right
|         three times.  The remainder of this Rule shall be
|         interpreted so as to be consistent with the intent of this
|         subrule.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1772 ["Promotor's Privilege"] be
      repealed.  [The privilege is incorporated into the revised Rule
      1771.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1862 ["The Voting Tariff"] be
      repealed.

For a minute there I thought you meant forcing people to make proposals.
Then I realized you only meant forcing people who do amke Proposals to
make them publically, and change their Priorities publically - both of
which I would support.

If this were proposed, I'd ask for arguments on the IN mailing list
why I should vote against the Proposal.  If I didn't hear any
good ones (and I expect I wouldn't), I'd support the Proposal.

I'd support this. Of course it does make the Ambassador rather pointless.
Not that I think we should get rid of the Office; I like having a specific
person in charge of foreign relations, but I would make it a salary-free
position.

I think such a radical cut would be a good thing in many ways. 

And it certainly gives us something to talk about, which is good,
too. (Except that Scott seems to be rather monosyllabic so far, as
often).

The following minor gripes concern only details.

I agree that eliminating the economic aspects of voting is a worthy
effort. I'm not perfectly sure I'd support it in the end, but I do
like the idea enough to discuss it seriously.

Scott's proto, however, also eliminates other aspects of the voting
system that one may either consider minor tweaks of the voting system,
or rather important features of a very abstract voting game whose
appeal does not depend on the semblance of an economy being connected
to it (I hold the latter view). Two of these details are

- the ability of groups to vote. This is an incentive for the
formation of groups, IMHO an attractive, very political concept; and
it ties this group concept in with a nomic essential, the right to
vote. Scott's proto removes this ability, which I regret.

- the ability to cast more than one vote. This is a source of
inequality among players that can drive many interesting developments,
and make offices, winning or whatever else grants access to extra
votes attractive. Again, Scott proposes to remove this feature.

Of course, one might opt for a simple, radical reform first and
reintroduce details like these two later. At least that would give us
something to do. But I'm not sure I'd vote for this reform if it
eliminates these nice features which I consider neither negligible
details nor white elephants.


In addition, I agree with other players that it would be nice to run
this reform in a trial version first. Scott may not like the idea, but
if enough other players do like it, we should go for it anyway.


[Meta level remark: One of the merits of Scott's radical reform proto
is that it gives rise to lots of debates (I hope). They can also model
various aspects of RL political debates about reforms: these usually
start out with rather radical plans; these plans are then watered down
by special interests and their lobbies (my contribution, in a sense,
is such a watering down), and there can be many disagreements on how
to implement the reform (trial run first, or just go for it in the
present case), even if the general goals are agreed on.

Scott, I do hope you are not taking such contributions as personal
attacks or something. If you don't feel like entering such debates,
well, you can either withdraw your proto, or just submit the proto and
wait what happens, or let others propose a substantially similar
reform after going through the preliminary debates in your place.]

My epiphany is this.  Any changes that *increase* the potential for discussion
within the game contribute to its health and longevity.  Any changes that
*decrease* the potential for discussion contribute to its stagnation and
possible demise.  Something to keep in mind from a "game design" perspective
(if you agree with me 8)).
<<

For me discussions are not everything. I'm also interested in the
result: whether a divers group of individuals can coopoerate to create
a stable, somewhat coherent set of rules for their interaction.

But I agree with your general point that discussions are a thing to be
encouraged.

>>
Originally, "Presence" was a change that tended to decrease discussion, because
it's an easy way out of taking a stand on a proposal.  Of course it's not as
bad as changes that make Players shut up completely 8), so it's reintroduction
was a step in the "right" direction.
<<

To this I would add that the absence of presence did, to my surprize,
not trigger many debates on voting strategies, or groups forming to
fix votes, or marketing campaigns to push or oppose proposals, not
even in conjunction with secret voting. But I guess that is more a
symptom of lack of time than lack of interest. Most of us seem to
think their time is only well spent on Agora if our actions
immediately change the game state, or, on the other hand, if we just
discuss on a very detached meta level, occasionally just taking Agora
events as springboard for more general debates on issues of law,
philosophy etc. the middle level, like drumming up support for certain
ideas, playing out group activities etc only happens if big proposals
are at stake.

I myself am starting to tire of these 'experiments', no matter how 
laudable their intent; they give me the feeling that there is some 
sort of 'baseline' Agora that we are reverting back to after trying
some sort of risky stuff - it used to be very different, back in the
days where we'd adopt all sorts of silliness and never look back.

Why should we do this?

Not that I'd mind losing my office (which, IMHO, should be abolished
if we withdraw from IN). But just because IN has a low level of
activity at the moment due to its lame moderator... I dunno.

Sigh. Those were the days... ;)

But we have made some of the changes first implemented in trial form
permanent later. Public voting, for instance. And I'd rather see the
changes _made_, even as a trial, than proposed in heroic purity and
rejected.

The subgame would have to be designed with elements that have intrinsica value
to *it* (like rats and food in one of those MOOs).  The point of the subgame
would *not* be changing Rules with proposals and voting.  It could be something
with which an ecomony is compatible (like Monopoly).  My point is that making
voting and proposal harder by making them the basis of an economy stifles a
Nomic because those are the whole point of the game, they are not just means to
some other end (some Players have even proposed completely eliminating the
concept of "wins", and few seem to care much about getting a win).

Groups have been a basically irrelevant feature of Agoran politics for
over a year now.  (I remember when they were not, and we're a long way
from making them relevant again.)  I will probably propose to
eliminate them soon, as well, as well as contests, another irrelevant
feature of Agoran politics.

The ability to cast more than one vote is rather meaningless in the
absence of costs to voting.  If everyone can cast N votes for no cost,
each voter will (presumably) always do so, and so all you've done is
multiply the final tally of each vote by some constant N.  Yippie.
(The situation is more interesting if only some people have the
privilege of casting multiple votes, but I am generally opposed to
introducing inequities of that sort at this time.)

I disagree on the merits on the issue of Groups as white elephants,
and believe your argument with respect to casting multiple votes is
flawed, as detailed above.  My intention is to excise the fat from
Agora's Rules, so as to make it easier to attack what I see to be core
problems in the Rules without having to worry about squiggly
interference from these peripheral issues.  (I also think that our
current voting economy substantially chills electoral participation,
which is without any doubt at all a bad thing, and which will make it
harder to enact substantial reforms.)

This proposal is not intended as a reform, nor do I offer it as an
experiment.  It reflects my fervent belief that the current state of
affairs is harmful and should be discontinued forthwith.  This may
also explain my opposition to a "trial run".

InterNomic is dead; it just hasn't noticed yet.  Its Rules have too
many severe problems, which are further compounded by an incompetent
and dilatory Moderator.  It is quite clear to me that InterNomic has
no reasonable hope of recovery, and that we should withdraw from it
rather than continue to perpetuate the farce.  Let us withdraw now,
learn from our errors, and at some future date set forth armed with
the knowledge we have learned from our failure to create a workable
InterNomic.

Ok, that's true. But then, although they were formally allowed to
vote, they hardly had a chance to make a difference by voting, so the

Of course. Multiple votes only have a purpose if they are unequally
distributed, with more votes for winners or office holders. Recently,
we've had a trend towards unequal rights, especially concerning
special powers for some office holders. And that was one of the more
substantial and positive trends recently, IMHO.

With that I agree. I just wonder what use it is to cut out features

remain attractive, because they give some color to nomic essentials.

I agree with the first part of your statement. But I think that even
major changes are easier to adopt now _if_ they are well prepared by

So if the alternative is adopting it as a trial, or rejecting it,
you'd choose to have it rejected? If so, would you mind someone else
proposing essentially the same proposal, but in a trial version?

Protoproposal Chaos39 [rev. 1]

Every Man Is an Island

NOTE: Text enclosed in right brackets has no legal significance and
      shall in no way affect the legality or efficacy of any part of
      this Proposal.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 766, 716, 719, 721, 1752, 718,
1446, 1539, 1528, 1614, 1612, 1531, 1547, 1759, 1533, 1397, 1617,
1458, and 717 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 206 be amended, by replacing
"Players and Groups are Voting Entities" with "Players are Voting
Entities".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which begins "A Will belonging to an Organization".

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by deleting the
paragraph which contains the phrase "the Notary may select".

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1601, 1637, 1738, and 1757 all be
amended, by replacing the word "Notary" with the word "Chancellor"
wherever it may appear.

[While there may be some utility in allowing bodies corporate, the
current Rules woefully fail to accomplish this in any useful sense.
Furthermore, most contests can be adequately carried forth under the
Law of Contracts (Rule 1742) without requiring the overhead of
statutory support.  SLCs should probably also go, but I'll cross that
bridge when I find it.]

The two reasons I can think of were that Groups could cast three votes
on each Proposal (while individuals could cast only one), and that
Groups could hoard Points through Game Ends.

I feel that this trend has gone too far.  Steve's aggressive efforts
to keep the VT supply thin, and his repeated "leveling" actions when
other efforts to do so have failed, disturb me: we apparently want
inequity, but we punish those (through leveling actions) who obtain
too much of it.  Bah!  Furthermore, the ongoing Accountor's Crisis
(it's been how long since we had an Accountor's Report that we could
feel confident in?) suggest that the current system is, from a
practical stance, too burdensome.

I doubt they will be reintroduced in anything resembling their present
form.

I abhor self-repealing clauses, and will not propose anything which
contains one.  I will not vote for any Proposal which contains one.

I won't sue over it, but I don't guarantee that I will support it or
take any effort to avoid stomping on it.  (I am quite likely to
attempt to repeal its sunset clauses, if adopted, however.)

The major reform I have in mind relates to what happens after we adopt
a proposal.  Here's a rough outline:

* Each adopted proposal becomes a rule.  For the sake of neatness I
  recommend starting to number rules at 2001 and keeping all existing
  rules with their present numbers.
* Once enacted, a rule persists forever, but may be deprived of legal
  effect by a later rule which amends or repeals it.
* The Rulekeepor will collate into a separate document all of those
  rule sections then in effect which are of a permanent and general
  nature.  Whether or not a rule section is actually included in this
  collation is of no legal import to the efficacy of that rule
  section.  The Rulekeepor will also organize these rule sections into
  some consistent, coherent structure.
* No Rule can be enacted (and thus no Rule amended, repealed, or
  otherwise changed) except by the adoption of a Proposal.  Sunset
  clauses can be effected by language in a Rule that states "No part
  of this Rule shall have any effect after [date]", after which the
  Rulekeepor will no longer list any section of that Rule in the
  codified law because it will no longer be in effect.  The Rulekeepor
  will be required to indicate in eir codification those Rules which
  have sunset clauses.  (Some Rules with sunset clauses will not
  appear in the codification because they are not of a "permanent
  nature"; this term will be defined more clearly in the final
  proposal.)
* The Rulekeepor will be required to maintain two documents: the
  Register of Rules (all Rules enacted) and the Codified Rules (the
  collection of rule sections mentioned above).  The former shall have
  no requirement for periodic publication in full.  The latter shall
  be published periodically.  The Rulekeepor will be encouraged, but
  not required, to make the Register of Rules generally accessible
  (via the Web, for example); it serves largely as a historical
  document.

I am still working on the necessary changes to implement these
notions.  I think I'm getting close, though.

But those are the same thing, Comrade Chaos.

We merely need to remove the decadent capitalist tendencies and let
privileges like voting and proposing be determined according to correct
political understanding of the needs of the Playerhood rather than an
arbitrary distribution of tokens.

But with your penchant for grandiose reforms, we can be sure
they will be reintroduced in one form or another.

Sounds similar to Suber's initial set, to me.  Haven't we moved
beyond that?

The main advantage I see is that you don't need self-repealing Rules
(which I object to on a variety of principles) to impose one-time or
short-term duties.  It also has the merit that the result of adopting
a Proposal more naturally corresponds to what we would think it would
be.  I also think there is merit to having a clearer historical
record.

I will admit that my main impetus is to restrict the power to change
Rules to the adoption of Proposals.  I object to self-modifying Rules
(generally, I object to the notion of the Rules as having agency)
because they are a source of uncertainty in the law itself.  This, in
my opinion, goes beyond merely bad and into the area of dangerously
stupid ideas.

Away from, yes.  "Beyond" implies that our current position is somehow
"advanced" with respect to the prior position, which I would dispute.

I see your point there, but I think something could be worked into
our present system of Orders rather than requiring this sort
of overhaul to achieve that goal.

Maybe it's just that I've been here so long, but to me, a
Proposal *already* naturally corresponds to what I think
it would be.

>I also think there is merit to having a clearer historical

The fact that we recently eliminated the Archivist position suggests
that several Agorans disagree with you on that point.

I don't follow--are you saying that Proposals (and not Rules) should
have agency?  If so, it seems you're only replacing the uncertainty of
Rules with the uncertainty of Rules+Proposals.

That's odd, because neither Suber nor Hofstadter are known for the
dangerous stupidity of their ideas - and sunset clauses are mentioned by
Hofstadter as something for Nomic players to try in the original 1982
article on Nomic (Metamagical Themas, p.82). Quite apart from that,
however, sunset clauses have a long history in the law, and it's not
hard to see why: they are a useful and sensible way of controlling the
effects of a law. I cannot see that, in general, they lead to any more
uncertainty than is endemic to law (although of course there are
specific cases of paradoxical self-amendment which one needs to be
careful of).

If that's what you believe, then why aren't you proposing to repeal the
Ruleset entire and replace it with the Initial Set?

I've considered this, but doing it is just as nasty, if not more so.
It's also less forgiving.

You have relatively little experience in dealing with rule-making
bodies, then; almost every rule-making body I've encountered (from
church associations up to including both the U.S. Congress and the
British Parliament) works in the manner I have described.

Well, the Statutes at Large is admittedly of relatively infrequent
use, but you do occasionally see references to it (mostly for
appropriation bills, which are never codified). :)

Not at all.  Under the system I would prefer, a Rule (=Adopted
Proposal) takes effect when it is proclaimed, in the form in which it
is proclaimed (although erroneous proclamation would create legal
defenses).  The agency rests with the Players assembled into a body
corporate and through the individual designated to make the
proclamation.  Neither the Proposal nor the Rule has any agency of its
own.

You have misunderstood my position.  Every sunset clause I've seen
(outside of Agora) says "This law shall have no effect after <date>."
This is _not_ intended to grant the Rule a generalized agency to
repeal itself; it merely restricts the law's scope of effectiveness.
The law is effectively repealed when it expires, and most reporters
would consider it repealed on that date; however, it has not been
repealed in the same sense that a law repealed by the act of the
lawmaker has been repealed.

I can't state it with absolute certainty, of course, but I have
_never_ seen any provision in any actual law that changes _itself_
without intervention.  I have, rarely, seen clauses which permit a law
to be amended in some limited way by the action of a designated person
or office, and of course judges in the American system have the power
to "implicitly repeal" laws by striking them down, but in both of
these cases the change in the law is made by the agency of some
individual entrusted with the authority to make changes.

I certainly do not believe that Suber's suggestion of sunset clauses
is unwise; I contest the wisdom of allowing the Rules to mutate
themselves sua sponte, which is not the same thing.

I for one have no intention to Vote simply because of A Duty to Vote.  If I
find a Proposal interesting I will vote on it.  If I don't find it
interesting, then I reserve the right not to vote on it as a way of making
that known.  If the are no interesting Proposals then I will just loose VTs
for nothing.  Over time, this might change my threshold for what I
considering interesting, but I will do everything I can to resist.

"Repeated", Scott? And "levelling"? What are you referring to? I have
made two Proposals which had subtantial effects on VT holdings: P3482
(Restore Game Balance, passed 11-0, 11 May 1997), and P3538 (Restore
Game Balance II, passed 4-0-6, 24 July 1997) - and I only made the
second one because a Judgement (CFJ 928) held that the first was
ineffective. So, in the first place, to call my actions repeated is a
distortion of the truth. But in the second place, neither of these were
"levelling" Proposals, because they more or less preserved the relative
wealth of Players. In the third place, these Proposals had the unanimous
support of Agorans; and in the fourth place, these events are now 15
months and more in the past. What are you so disturbed about? Taxes?
They aren't levelling either. Any socialist will happily, or perhaps
bitterly, talk your ears off complaining about the regressive,
inequitable nature of flat taxes, which is what we have.

Yes, I have pursued a policy of keeping VTs scarce. In this, I have been
joined by Crito, Kolja, Blob, Macross and many others. There has been a
broad and solid political consensus behind this policy, and this should
be no surprise. The idea was and remains a good one. Were things better
when there were 8000 VTs in circulation, with Crito, Jeff and I holding
6000 between us?

That's interesting. I'm not averse to using clauses which say "This Rule
shall have no effect after <date>." rather than "This Rules repeals
itself at <date>."

I hereby transfer 1 VT to MBC for my October dues.

I hereby cast a vote for Lee's subway system.  This is an excellent room
with a metaphor so strong that it at first glance seems more complicated
than it really is.

That's an interesting and not entirely unexpected reaction, but it has
no effect on my argument for raising the BOS. If you're rich enough to
afford to vote, then a VT of yours will be going out of circulation
whether you vote or not. (Calling this 'expenditure' in the above was a
bit misleading, though.) 

By the way, you can always ABSTAIN on a Proposal as a way of indicating
your disinterest in it. See R683/6.

If, over time, "A Duty to Vote" has the effect of lowering the threshold
of what you consider to be interesting, then I think it will have been a
success.

Since the whole point of this Proposal is to make it simpler to accomplish
other modifications to the Ruleset, a trial is utterly pointless.  The
reason for this is that it would be difficult to impossible to make the
types of changes I think GC is looking for on top of a trial and still
retain the ability to exit out of the trial gracefully.  Without these
additional changes I think the trial would be doomed to failure.  Thus it
seems that an all or nothing approach is warranted.

[Note:  This in no way means that I support the proto.  I have yet to make
up my mind on it.]

I think you're confusing two different protos of Scott's. The above
remark makes sense if applied to Scott's proposals to change the
Proposal system. I agree that these cannot really be experimentally
trialled. The suggestion for a trial was for Scott's proto to remove
VTs and P-Notes as part of the proposal making and voting system. I
think that could be trialled.

Yes. It is defined as vote by R683, and there's game custom that
abstaining (as distinct from declaring Presence) costs a VT.

You think so? I think the recent protos have been sparked more by
concerns about there having been a lack of ideas recently, and perhaps
by my challenge to people to provide constructive alternatives in
addition to criticism. I haven't made any connection specifically with A
Duty to Vote.

I agree: if we are to adopt a radical reform, let's move on to something
new, not back to our starting place. I've got an inkling of an idea of
Officer based power structures, with Elections being the driving force
of change, but I don't have any specifics yet.

That's not being nitpicky; the Judgement of CFJ 1100 holds that this is
the meaning of R1808/0. However, the Rule has now been amended (by
P3793) to remove the word "directly" from it.

To me, this is a but like saying: if it's so important in Monopoly to
buy properties, then it shouldn't cost anything to do it.

It is precisely *because* it is so important that people vote on
Proposals that we decided to make it the basis for the economy, and it
is precisely *because* it is so important that people vote on Proposals
that making it compulsory is also a good idea.

Agora's decision to impose costs for voting and making Proposals is what
distinguishes it from other Nomics. I don't think we should be in any
hurry to dismantle this system.

I'll probably get howled down for even contemplating this, but radical
ideas are in the air, so, donning my asbestos suit, here goes:

the problem: not enough Proposals being made.
the solution: A Duty to Propose.

Lots of details to be worked out, of course: who would have such a
duty? How often? How would they be selected? What would the penalties
for refusal be?

Reactions?

What is the accepted interpretation of "midnight GMT Thursday" in R1862?
Is that Thursday morning, or Thursday night?

If, as I imagine, it means Thursday morning, then I have missed my chance
to change the Tariff for this week. In any case, I announce that if 
Michael does not change the BOS by Monday next week, I will use my
power as Assessor to reduce the Tariff to 0.5 VTs. This is not directly
equivalent to raising the BOS, because it effectively double all VT
holdings and doubles the VTCL, but it is better, imho, than continuing
with the current VT sttarved environment.

Also, I offer the following proto:

PROTO: Allow Free Voting (at the Assessor's Discretion)

Amend Rule 1862 (The Voting Tariff) by replacing the text
"between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive" with "between 0 and 2 inclusive".

[Comment: Some players want to bring back free voting. Rather than 
 eliminate the entire pay-for-vote system, we can simply give the
 Assessor the power to make all voting free, for a period of time.
 Of course doing so will dramatically cut eir Commission, but that
 shouldn't bother the free-for-voters, as there would be no need for
 the Assessor to earn VTs in the first place. :)]

My comment was directed more toward your statement that VT expenditure would
double.  I agree that the BOS should be increased.

I'm aware that I can ABSTAIN, however some Proposals aren't even worth that
much.  :)  While that remark was intended as a joke it occurs to me that it
is essentially true.  There are Proposals that I simply don't pay any
attention to.

Will ABSTAINing constitute a Vote under A Duty to Vote?

I'm not sure what to make of this comment.  You are of course free to set
your own criteria for judging the success of your Proposals, but I for one
would be happier to see the Proposals get better rather than my tolerance
for mediocrity grow.

BTW, I have changed my mind on A DUTY to Vote.  Oh, I still opposed the
concept, but it seems to have sparked quite a few interesting ideas and
Protoes.  In that regard, it is definitely a boon.  I congratulate you on
that score.

Interestingly enough, Suber's Initial Set had this feature. Players 
took turns making proposals. I quote:

201. Players shall alternate in clockwise order, taking one whole turn 
     apiece. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may
     not be omitted....

202. One turn consists of two parts in this order: 
         (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on,
         ....

Clearly not everything should be tried as an experiment. But some things
are especially well suited for it. I'm very glad that I didn't propose
to repeal R1715 (Presence); suppressing its effect for 2 months was a
much better idea. The resulting change in voting patterns was
instructive. Secret Voting is another example. We've tried that for 4
months, and it's been interesting in some ways, but I'll be happy to
have Public Voting back again next week.

"Midnight Thursday" is Thursday night/Friday morning, I've always
thought. So I think you can still change the Tariff this week.

We're starved in terms of input, maybe, but there are plenty of VTs
in circulation. I wouldn't be surprised if the next Accountor's Report
shows that a tax is due to be levied.

An interesting idea!

What I am suggesting is not merely a "return to our starting place";
it's a change to something which is based on a different paradigm that
happens to be more closely related to the original tradition than our
current (badly wedged) paradigm.

I'd resign if a generalized duty to propose was created.  It's hard,
time-consuming work to produce a proposal worthy of my imprimateur,
and to be frank I have better things to do than write makeweight
proposals.

Non-officers; the penalty being loss of the "unemployment" benefit.
Let's put those lazy welfare bums to work! :)

I'm not sure whether I'd support it, but I think it's an interesting
idea.

Wednesday night/Thursday morning, I'd say.  Note the very strong
game custom supporting this in the definition of the Nomic Week,
R459.

On the contrary, I do have a fair amount of experience with them.
Probably not as much as you have, but I have seen it done both
ways.  The U.S. Constitution, of course, follows your example:
when the constitution is printed, it's always the original
document, followed by all its amendments; even the 18th amendment,
which was subsequently repealed by the 21st.  Other organizations
I have been involved with, however, do it the other way: amendments
are incorporated directly into the constitution and/or bylaws, much
as Agora currently does.

Even if most legislative bodies do it the former way, however,
I don't see this as an argument that Agora should do it that way.
"That's how RL legal systems do it" carries no weight with me,
any more than an argument by Blob that "That's how computers
do it" would.
