I think this is a little ambiguous -- something like "each Player" rather 
than "those Players" would be better.  Otherwise it sounds like you could 
add together the holdings of several Players.

So since Steve had effective control of Kolja's assets, he had a Duty to
Vote. Could he have fulfilled it by casting Kolja's votes in Kolja's name?

Surely it's the value at the point of billing, or the value when the

The following is not a Proposal

Protoproposal Vlad-FP v.1

Create a Rule entitled "Free Proposals" with the following text:

A Player may make any Proposal in the Proposal queue a Free
Proposal by transferring 2 P-Notes to the Bank for that purpose.
The Voting Tariff on a Free Proposal is automatically zero.
This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would make
the Voting tariff on a Free Proposal greater than zero.

Eljefe seems to have misunderstood my argument. He claims that
3833 wasn't a second distribution, as if I didn't agree. My
posting of the above CFJ clearly indicates I felt that the
attempted second distribution was illegal. He then claims the
illegal attempted second distribution was in fact a correction. My
dictionary says a correction is "something offered or substituted
to correct an error". As I said (and what eljefe agreed to) is
that the error that needed to be corrected is the assigning of
a number to "3830". But G. Chaos' messages indicate he did not
attempt to correct that error, but rather tried to correct a
spurious error (the non-distribution of "3830") by distributing
it. But since "3830" was already distributed (as eljefe has
admitted) and since a Proposal can't be distributed twice (as
eljefe admitted, although for the wrong reasons), then this
was an illegal correction of an error that never occurred.
ElJefe would have us believe that the attempted redistribution
of "3830" was, in fact no such thing, but instead a clarification
of the original distribution. But G. Chaos' message indicates he
was not making such a clarification. Can an Officer make a correction
without intending to? That would set a dangerous precedent. An
Officer might post two messages, both containing POs. Does the
second message "correct" the first? We can't tell, for the clear
statement of the Officer's intent apparently doesn't suffice
anymore.

I made a similar suggestion a while ago, and I still think the idea is
a good one, but I think the Player should have to pay in VTs.  I
reckon the cost should be (Quorum * Current Voting Tariff).

That seems rather high. With the current tariff, the cost would
be close to 10 VTs, which would represent several weeks salary
for most officers. Making the payment in P-Notes both fits with
the cost of Sane Proposals, and creates a sort of equivalence
between P-Notes and VTs that I think would be good for the
long-term stability of the economy. Under your system, if we
had sudden deflation in VTs (such as we have right now), it
would be harder to make Free Proposals, when it should probably
be easier. Conversely, when the tariff is low, there is less need
for Free Proposals, so there is little sense in making it cheaper
at such times.

Protoproposal Chaos99 [rev. 2]

Reformat Rule 1431

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1431 be amended to read:

      (a) A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to
          the effect that a specific post to the Public Forum
          misrepresents the actual Game State, and documenting the
          nature of the error.

      (b) A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the
          Public Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of
          the Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making
          the admission is required to post a corrected version of the
          relevant portion of the message which was in error, before
          one week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A
          Player who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction
          is deemed not to have Responded to that Claim.

      (c) A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by
          the Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim
          within one week of the Claim being made, unless any of the
          following holds:
        (1) a previous Claim was made concerning the same error;
        (2) the message claimed to be in error was posted more than 21
            days before the claim was made; or
        (3) another message by the Player in error has corrected the
            error

      (d) A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted
          time commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response,
          carrying a penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player
          who posted the Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a
          denial of a Claim commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial,
          a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the Claim within 72
          hours after the incorrect denial.

It is a generally-accepted rule in Agora that intent is irrelevant
Except when the Rules explicitly make it relevant.

Reformat Rule 1552

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1552 be amended to read:

      (a) In order for an Official Document to be valid for the
          purpose of a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following
          criteria at the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is
          Proposed:
        (1) the Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
            maintain the Document;
        (2) the Rules require the Document to be published in the
            Public Forum or otherwise distributed to all Players;
        (3) the Document is not currently subject to a Claim of Error
            (COE);
        (4) the Document is not currently the subject of a pending
            Call for Judgement (CFJ) or Appeal of a CFJ;
        (5) the information within the Document has not been
            superseded by a subsequent Document; and
        (6) the Document is not the Ruleset.

      (b) Further, a Document can become invalid for the purpose of
          Ratification if, during the Voting Period of a Proposal
          which would Ratify it, any of the following occurs:
        (1) the Document is superseded by a subsequent Document which
            contradicts the information in the prior Document, unless
            the superseding document is itself corrected such that no
            contradiction exists, prior to the end of the Voting
            Period of the Proposal to Ratify; or
        (2) The Document becomes the subject of a pending CFJ or a
            pending appeal of a CFJ.

      (c) The validity for Ratification of a Document is not affected
          if, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
          Document, another Document is issued that does not
          contradict the prior Document.

I like this idea.

Didn't you read my example? Every PO issued by an Officer could

You can pretend this is so, but the game couldn't exist if we
didn't take into account intent. I assume that your posts to the
PF entitled 'Promotor's Report' are intended to be Official Reports,
and that your other posts to the PF aren't.

I think it is pretty shady.  However, I did suggest some time ago that it
might be a good idea to allow Contests to register Patent Titles for their
own use.

It would seem to fit in with Scott's idea of consolidating Player-like
entities, too.

No problem, but then I am on the conlang list, a place where some people
are trying to construct languages with features more weird than anything
seen/heard on Earth (usually merely to be told by the resident proper
linguists about some obscure little Amazonian language that does exactly
the same.)

That's impossible. I wasn't even a Player 300 Proposals ago. Or is
this some bizarre Chuck-like joke about my voting mishap?

You're almost there, but then I already know you agree with me.
If we can use common sense in accepting your repost as a correction,
then we can use common sense to understand that I wasn't voting for
Blob's Proposal, or at least we can have the sense to ask for a
clarification. That's the point I wanted to make with my CFJs

This is false. The judgement was silent on that issue.

This is false.  I made no such claim about the message.  I viewed the
message as (possibly among other things) evidence that a number had been
assigned to a Proposal.

This is false. The judgement was silent on whether the second message
distributed the Proposal again.

But tell me, what Rule prevents it?  I know the Proposal is removed from
the Queue on the first distribution, but where does it explicitly say that
it needs to be in the Queue when distributed?  Rule 1770 defines how the
proposals are selected for the week's batch, and says that only those
proposals may be distributed that week. Vlad's proposal was one of them,
and both the first and the second message came within the proper week.

I wonder what this means about the Voting Period?

Where _are_ you reading this, Vlad?

Let's say that Vlad is correct (I'm not saying one way or the other), and
the second message was an attempted distribution of the Proposal.

Think about what that means: the Promotor was intending to distribute the
Proposal. He was clearly intending in the same message to give number 3833
to the Proposal. These are two different actions mandated by Rule 109.

I know enough in this case about the Officer's clear intent, because he
intended to do what was legal for em to do, namely assign 3833 to the
Proposal. He succeeded.
