Oops, I hope I didn't mislead you about the Voting Tariff. It suddenly
occurs to me that the Tariff may already be 1.2 VTs for Proposals being
distributed this week.

As I understand it, the change setting it to 1.2 occured during this
Nomic Week and therefore does not take effect until next Nomic Week.
The attempt to set it to 0.4 took place after Thursday and therefore
had no effect at all.

Not that I've noticed.  If you did it's not in my archive.  You may
have mistakenly submitted it to agora-d, which goes into a separated
part of my archive that I don't generally search.

>> 1865 Rule is hereby Repealed.

Steve> Is that really the text of the Proposal? What happened?

My predecessor made an unfortunate error in transcribing the Proposal.
However, I believe we concluded that the error was harmless, since it
is nothing more than a difference in grammar which does not impair our
ability to ascertain the meaning of the communication.

Yeah, I realized the exact same thing myself.  I don't have any good

You could introduce an error margin in the rule, so that proposals
submitted within say, an hour of the deadline may or may not be
distributed, at the Promotor's disgression.

However, Macross is not exactly the inventor of 'A Duty to Propose'. The
original concept was mine, but I expressed it awkwardly. Macross came up
with much more elegant way of realizing the idea, which I made the basis
of the Proposal, and which Macross then submitted.

By the way, Macross, are you there? You have a CFJ to Judge. And jeff,
you're awfully Quiet...

It is zero for these proposals. For proposals distributed next week,
it will be 1.2 VTs. Considering the kerfuffle over the BOS rules, I may have
made this change rashly, and so I will probably have to change it again
next week. We'll see.

Well, if it were happening a lot, it would be quite easy to fix,
although the way I've thought of fixing it would mean restricting the
Promotor's freedom a fair bit. (Perhaps there are other fixes that don't
involve this.)

Basically, you set aside Monday as Proposal Distribution day, and you
don't allow any Proposal submissions on Monday (or make any that are
submitted on Monday ineffective until Tuesday).

But since it doesn't happen very often, it doesn't seem worth it.

Of course, but if you *were* a Player *and* in a good mood, what then?

I'm not sure whether that is right... That is, I think Agoran
Currencies could be made that were redeemable for, say, blue poker
chips, but they never would be the actual chips themselves; if we
passed a Rule saying 'blue poker chips are a Currency' then what
Recordkeepors would be concerned with is 'ownership' of a debt or
credit of blue poker chips, not the things themselves. The 'actual 
holdings' of blue poker chips would matter little.

The words I used were "I hereby issue the following Transfer Order:"

I mistakenly wrote 'Transfer' where I meant 'Payment'.

Here is some added information, using old Judgements (most from 1997),
the Ruleset, and my own memories of creating the stare decisis list.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Probably Deb & Bob is the submitter, in that case. I don't know where I got
the early CFJs, unfortunately. However, Michael's name for CFJ1 I got because
I did not have any name. Michael then posted that he had judged that, because
at that time the Speaker would judge all CFJs. Good chance that this was still
the case around the time of this Judgement.

In this case I am quite sure that Oerjan must have been the Judge. This CFJ
was found in some old archive, and IIRC the form in which I saw it was pretty
much the same as the present one.

The CFJ was about a Rule that forced players to use some elevating text
when talking about the Speaker (i.e., some positive adjective like 'exalted'
should be included). One player was said to have broken this rule on some
completely different forum.

Why do you think it failed? IIRC, the Rules at the time were such
that in case of a tie, the Speaker made a deciding vote, this being the
only time when e was allowed to vote. So I guess there was just a positive
Speaker's vote here.

Also, note that Rule 591 is in the Ruleset, with the following history:
History:
Initial Mutable Rule 216, Jun. 30 1993
Amended by Proposal 409, Aug. 26 1993
Amended by Proposal 591, Oct. 21 1993
Amended(1) by Proposal 1320, Nov. 21 1994
... and then 11 more later amendments. See below for the original text
of Rule 216.

Especially since this is just after the creation of Groups, I think another
good explanation would be that Group Votes are involved. At some time,
and that may well have been instituted here, Groups had one Vote for each
member they had. I also notice that in the following batch each Proposal
had either 17 or 20 Votes. Is the difference of 3 Votes caused by the Vototron?

The Rule is still in our Ruleset (although amended), so you can easily give
a more precise indication than 'had something to do with...' In fact, I think
that the first line of this Rule might well have gone through the days
unaltered. Here is the current form:

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

Also note that you have added this Proposal twice:

Looking at the stare.txt list, I can remember that CFJ 778 was about the
text "a Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes", which thus apparently
at that time was part of the text of Rule 594. Also note that the present
Rule 594 is about Rule Changes through Proposals. Unless Proposal 1323 really
made this Rule into something completely different, I think that that's also
what the original Rule must have been (partly) about. Maybe it originally
specified what a Proposal should consist of?

> 		Prop. 693		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,
> 							passed 6-0-6.

Amended Rule 205.

Given that both the original Rule 205 and the current Rule 693 define the
Voting Period, it seems safe to assume that that is what this Proposal
is about.

> 		Prop. 663		Prop. Logs	Proposed by J.
> 							Shea, passed 12-2
> 					stare.txt	Something
> 							regarding Injunctions?

I think this Proposal actually created Injunctions.
Here is the (heavily amended...) October 1997 version of the Rule:

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

> 		Prop. 789		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Chuck,
> 					stare.txt	passed 4-1-0.
> 							Rule governing 
> 							Injunctions.

Rule 789 defined Injunctions to make annotations to Rules. In its 1997
text, it contained the text:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

> 		Prop. 376		Prop. Logs	Proposed by R.
> 							Kunne, passed 7-3.

CFJ 707 quotes this Rule (but only a part of this Rule) as:

      The moment of the completion of the vote is defined by the date
      and time given in the line starting with "Date:" of the Nomic
      listserver message send by the Benevolent Speaker, announcing
      the result of the vote on the corresponding proposal.

At the moment the Rule tells us when a Proposal takes effect. At the
time of this CFJ, the Rule was titled "When Does a Rule Change Take
Effect?" so it seems likely that this has always been the function of
this Rule, and thus is the subject of this Proposal.

>From the Ruleset: Amended Rule 215. Rule 215 from the initial Ruleset
was:

215.  After the Speaker has distributed the statement to be judged and the
      identity of the Judge, the Judge has one week in which to deliver a
      legal judgement.  If the Judge fails to deliver a judgement within
      this time, e is penalized 10 points and a new Judge is selected.
      A judgement is delivered by submitting that judgement to the
      Speaker, who must then distribute that judgement to all players
      as soon as possible.

What's that supposed to mean I don't know. Are you certain it was already
with 750 that amended Rules were Indexed? I think that that was Proposal
1502, which amended this Rule (then already numbered 1069).

> 4/13/94		Prop. 879		RS1		Passed. Amended Rule .
> 					Agora Dig. 	201

Rule 201 was:

201.  Quorum for a proposed rule change is defined to be 20% of Voters
      at the beginning of the prescribed voting period for that proposal

Rule 879 still deals with Quorum, so that's what the Proposal probably
also was about.

> ???		Prop. 880		stare.txt	Passed. Regulated
> 							succession of 
> 							Officers. Amended Rule

>From the Ruleset: Amended Rule 405.

Here the November 1997 version of the Rule:

Rule 880/4 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without
      consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.  An Officer
      who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed to have
      appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

Origin of current Rule 1011, "Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily
Changed".

Presumably forced deregistration, at least that's what the Rule (1043)
is doing now.

Has already been corrected. The Ruleset now specifies 9/03/93.

Created the Office of CotC.

Amended Rule 213, which allowed the making of CFJs.

> 							passed 8-5.

Current Rule 698, probably defined who were allowed to be chosen to
judge a CFJ

> 		Prop. 409		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Alexx,
> 							passed 6-3.
> 							(Clerk of the

Amended Rule 216 (about legal Judgements). Original text:

216.  A legal judgement is either TRUE, FALSE, or UNDECIDED.  The
      judgement may be accompanied by reasons and arguments, but such
      reasons and arguments form no part of the judgement itself.  If a
      judgement is accompanied by reasons and arguments, the Speaker must
      distribute the reasons and arguments along with the judgement.

Probably the only change was that 'Speaker' was changed into 'Clerk of
the Courts'.

> 		Prop. 451		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Alexx,
> 							passed 4-1.

Specified that in judging, the situation at the time the CFJ was called
is decisive.

Passed, and still exists. Forces players to tell their prefered email
address to the Distributor.

> 11/02/93	Prop. 683		Prop. Logs	Proposed by

Amended Rule 207, which originally read:

207.  Voters may vote either for or against any proposal within its
      prescribed voting period.  In order to be legally cast, the vote
      must be received by the Speaker by the end of the prescribed voting
      period.  The Speaker may not reveal any votes until the end of the
      prescribed voting period.  Any Voter who does not legally vote within
      the prescribed voting period shall be deemed to have abstained.

> 		Prop. 698		Prop. Logs	Proposed by Wes,

Amended Rule 482. The current Rule is about eligibility to judge a
CFJ, and that there is always someone eligible.

No, that was of a later date. Don't know where they appealed at that
time, see Prop. 690.

The Ruleset seems to disagree that this was an Amendment.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

And some that you don't have:

Prop. 790 seems to have passed, given that we have a Rule 790 now.
Although the contents of the Rule have changed, its subject (how to
fill an Office) is likely to have remained the same over time.

Prop. 805 seems to have passed, grandfathering Rule 1023, which
defines "as soon as possible".

Prop. 833 seems to have passed, given that there once was a Rule
833. It probably gave some or other reward to proposers.

Prop. 889 seems to have passed, amending Rule 406, on 13 April 1994.

Prop. 897 seems to have passed, allowing callers of CFJ to bar Players
from Judgement.

Prop. 907 seems to have passed, amending Rule 805.

Prop. 908 passed on 4 May 1994, and amended Rule 781.

Prop. 910 passed on 4 May 1994, creating the Justiciar.

Prop. 911 passed on 4 May 1994, amending Rule 690, and creating the
 board of Appeals.

Just as a clarification: I meant that the Court of Appeals was of a later
date (Proposal 911), I assume that instituting Appeals might well be in 
this Proposal.

I can shed some light on this, since I was the author of P1069. In
Agora's initial Set, and for a long time afterwards (until the adoption
of P1069, in fact), every Rule's Number was the Number of the Proposal
which had most recently amended it.

When I registered in the game for the first time in July 1994, I had
already been Watching for several months, wondering whether I was going
to get back involved in Nomic after 8 months travelling overseas. During
that time it became clear that fundamental parts of the Ruleset
concerning Proposal making and adopting Rule Changes desperately needed
reform, and it was this project that eventually lured me back into the
game. I joined Kelly and others (unfortunately, I can't remember exactly
whom, but it may have been Ronald Kunne and elJefe) in creating the
Reform Group, which was dedicating to pursuing the reforms which we
thought were necessary for the game to thrive. The most important of
these reforms was the system of Mutability (the concept which later
evolved into Power); a less important reform, though one just as
long-lasting, was changing the Rule Numbering system so that Rules would
not keep annoyingly changing their Numbers every time they were amended.
(This was achieved by P1067; see the history of R109.)

It was this facet of the system which produced R750, which worked like
this: every time a Rule was amended, R750 would add an additional
amendment, appending the text "*Was Rule N*" to the text of the newly
amended Rule, to help Players keep track of which Number the Rule they
were now reading used to have. From the time of the adoption of P750
until the adoption of P1069, these annotations proliferated through the
Ruleset, and a few of them were still hanging around quite a long time
after P1069 was adopted. I don't remember when the last one was finally
eliminated from the Ruleset.

For a long time, R833 provided for the F-A reward for Proposers.
Proposal 833 must therefore have been an amendment to one of the very
earliest Rules to have been adopted (can't remember the Number now, but
it's in Vlad's Prolegomena), which created this reward, or one of its
successors.

On the other hand, it may well be a good idea to limit the number of
Proposals which can be placed in the Proposal Queue, to, say, 10, or
limit the number of Proposals any one Legislator can have in the Queue
at one time, or both, which might make Legislators think carefully about
what Proposals they were prepared to submit.
<<

I don't like this trend of putting in limitations you want to achieve
"by hand". Why can't we use the economy we have to let such limits
appear by themselves? At the moment, the limited P-note supply limits
the number of proposals that can make it to a distributable status in
the queue. What more do we need? Just let legislators pay to submit
proposals, and limit the P-note supply enough to make it work.

In fact, the type of separation between legislators and voters thatI
would really like to see would be completely determined by pulling
economic strings, not making rules about who may submit proposals, and
who may vote. Simply divide players into two groups, one of which can
only earn P-notes (no matter what the source, salaries, judging,
rewards...) and one which earns only VTs. Then limit the way one can
change from one group to another, and voila, you have legislators and
Voters simply because of the currency they have access to.

Of course, they can exchange currency to extend "their" priviledge to
others. And I think simply swapping VTs vs P-notes is much simpler,
but has pretty much the same effect, as swapping "favours",
i.e. promising each other tovote or submit in a particular way.

Here is what I get from browsing an August 1996 ruleset.

<<<< not mentioned >>>> means that the information is on a Proposal

Was unchanged until August 1996, so I can give the full text:

      As long as a Proposal satisfies all requirements in place at the
      time of its making for the proper making of Proposals, the act
      of making such a Proposal is legal regardless of its content.
      It is legal to propose a Rule which conflicts with other Rules
      or with itself, which is paradoxical, or which cannot be
      applied.

Amended Rule 218. Actually, I think that it restricted rather than
extended the duties of the Speaker.

Are you sure? Both the present and the August 1996 Ruleset give
9/03/93. There is a date 6/30/93, but that's simply the date of the initial
Ruleset (and thus of Rule 204).

Forbids arbitrary changing of Game Entities, now Rule 1011.

Stipulated that the situation at the time of the calling of the CFJ counts
when determining the truth or falsity of a CFJ.

Full text:

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week unless
      otherwise stated in the Rules. Any activity which must occur
      at least weekly must occur at least once each Nomic Week.

Forced deregistration, that is.

Created the present Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge), so probably
regulated Judge eligibility.

Passed; amended Rule 411. The new text of the Rule was:

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

Complete text:

      notify the Distributor of this change. If a Player fails to
      notify the Distributor of a change of address, the Distributor

Proposal 586 passed, and amended the Judge Selection Rule. This was
Rule 410, but may have been amended between Proposals 410 and 586 as
well.

All I can say that in August 1996, after 2 Amendments, one in November
1994, and the other in January 1996, the Rule read:

Rule 594/2 (Mutable, MI=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      A Proposal may contain one or more Rule Changes.  If a Proposal
      containing Rule Changes is adopted, the Rule Changes contained
      in the Proposal shall take effect in the order they appear in
      the Proposal.

      Unless another Rule states otherwise, the Adoption Index of a
      Proposal shall be the minimum Adoption Index which would allow
      all Rule Changes and Directives within the Proposal to take
      effect, or 1, whichever is greater.

      In no case may a Proposal have an Adoption Index of less than 1.

Rule 786 in August 1996 already defined the Order of Succession. But I

Well, now, this is an interesting idea, and well worth considering. I do
think it's fair bit more complicated to introduce than the current
proto, though. Think about the details. If I change from being a
Legislator to a Voter, then in your scheme this means that I change from
being a Player who can only earn P-Notes, to a Player who can only earn
VTs. In the present regime, however, there's no flexibility about what
Currencies I earn for doing particular things, so the ways in which
Official and Judicial Salaries are paid is going to have to be
substantially altered to allow for such flexibility. And it will mean
added complexity for those executing the POs to pay the Salaries, too.

Probably the reason why the proto is written the way it is, is the
presence already in the Ruleset of the concepts of Voting and Proposing
Entities. Making use of these concepts makes 'A Separation of Powers'
quite easy to implement.

Hmmm. The History of R594 gives this:

History:
Created by Proposal 594, Oct. 21 1994
Amended(1) by Proposal 1323, Nov. 21 1994
Amended(2) by Proposal 2399, Jan. 20 1996
Amended(3) by Proposal 3445 (General Chaos), Mar 26 1997, substantial

But that first date must be an error. '1994' must be '1993'. (Rulekeepor
Chuck, please note.)

Given the time and subject matter, it is certain that P1323 was proposed
by Kelly as part of the reform of the process of making and adopting
Proposals. I think I remember discussing with Kelly what the exact
wording of the second paragraph should be. It is therefore likely that
the subject matter of the original R594/0 was also Proposals and Rule
Changes.

I sure would love to see the texts of the Proposals originating from the
Reform Group during October and November 1994. The back-door we created
and then closed to allow the Immutable Rules to be transmuted with only
a 3/4 supermajority, rather than unanimity, was a gem, a true piece of
legislative art, and probably among my favourite Proposals of those I
have worked on.

It was.  I seem to recall that it dealt with the requirement to
caption a Proposal with the type of Rule Change (or non-Rule Change)
it was.  We used to have to put "(Amends a Rule)" or something like
that on every Proposal.  I think.

I might have those, although I suspect if I do they're on my Amiga,
which I haven't booted in three years.

Sorry, but I can't take credit for inventing the Duty to Propose.  I did
submit the Proposal which was authored by Steve.  He kindly allowed me to
propose it in compensation for my suggestion of a simplified algorithm as I
hadn't previously had a Proposal pass.

In fact, I was initially against the idea as is shown by this sarcastic
reply I sent to a-d when Steve asked how his initial mechanism could be
simplified:

    There are simpler and more straightforward algorithms that accomplish
    almost exactly the effect you are trying to achieve.  How about
    something like:

        Let there be a Property of Players known as their Bully Status (BS).
        A Player's BS is either Bullied or Unbullied.  All Players' initial
        BS is Unbullied.  The Registrar shall maintain a list of all
        Players' BS, ordered according to when each Player last proposed
        from least to most recently.  This list is part of the Registrar's
        report.

        At the beginning of each Nomic week, the Registrar shall change the
BS
        of the first Active Unbullied Player on the list to Bullied.

        When a Player comes off hold the Registrar shall immediately change
        the BS of the Player to Bullied if the following conditions are
true:
            1)  The Player is the first Unbullied Player on the list.
            2)  The Player was on hold for a period of less than 1 week.

        Upon submission of a Proposal by a Bullied Player, the Registrar
shall
        change that Player's BS to Unbullied.

        Any Player who is Bullied for 2 consecutive weeks commits the
        Infraction of Ignoring This BS, incurring a penalty of 1
        Blot and 1 P-Note, to be detected and reported by the Registrar.

Although I later changed my mind on a Duty to Propose, this should make it
clear that I only put forth this simpler algorithm to keep the previous
horrible attempt (with all due respect to Steve) out of the Rules.

I've been very busy of late and so haven't been following things as closely
as I might and am not aware of all the relevant details of this case.  In
particular I have a few questions I'd like answered.

Are the facts, as laid out in this paragraph, in dispute?

If possible could someone forward the text of this message to me?
I would be grateful if anyone, Morendil and Scott in particular, could tell
me why they believe the message in question should constitute a submission.

On first glance, I tend to agree with this but I will need more time to
reflect on the evidence before I can give my final Judgement.
