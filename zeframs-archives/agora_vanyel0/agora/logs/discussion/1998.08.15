Suggestion to reduce F/Qs: refund the cost of voting for voters on
proposals which do F/Q. Why didn't anyone vote on 3778, anyways? (not even
the Proposer)

Thanx for pointing this out. I'll wait till next week.

Which reminds me of a proto-proposal I was thinking about the other day.
What if we allowed Players to amend Payment Orders in order to make 
themselves Payor? That way you could take someone else's debt upon
yourself. So in a situation like this, I could offer to take upon
myself the debts incurred by whoever took over the Accountorship.

Also, it would give players with little currency some room for 
bargaining. Rather than offering currency, they could offer to take 
on someone else's debt instead.

An interesting consequence would be that it would be cheaper for a group
of players to consolidate their debt onto one player, so that only one
lot of debt blots get distributed a week. Maybe a player could become
a professional "Debt Collector" in this way.

Okay, you're on. Following Michael's suggestion, I'll make the 
handover at the beginning of next week, so that you don't incur 
any penalties for failing to report.

Come visit AgoraMOO and see how it has changed over the last week.  I
would like suggestions and critiques.  Kolja has been especially
helpful the last week.
