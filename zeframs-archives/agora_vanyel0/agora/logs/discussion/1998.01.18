No, it doesn't.  Rule 1494 has been repealed.

It would be doubly (perhaps triply) inappropriate to include this in
the Omnibus Reform.  One, it's not related to anything else in the
Omnibus Reform (which, despite its name, is actually limited to one
area of the Rules).  Two, it would require an AI of 2 for the Omnibus
Reform.  Three, it's possible that I might never propose the Omnibus
Reform. :)

Already has, based on Public Forum votes.

No, its important that free proposals are possible, for two reasons. One,
poor players should still be able to make them, even if their chances of
getting them distributed are slim.

Two, it is important that there is still a way to make proposals, even 
if something breaks, and P-Notes disappear, or cannot be transfered.

Any ideas for what the Infraction should be called? I think it should
somehow be tied in with the Failure to Report and the Dereliction of
Duty infractions.

The Official Report mechanism isn't very flexible. There should be the
possibility to have more than one Official Report.
