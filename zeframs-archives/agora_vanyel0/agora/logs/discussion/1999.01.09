I live in Australia, where the various states follow different policies
regarding daylight savings. Victoria, where I live, has daylight
savings, and I like it a lot, since it transfers an hour of daylight
from the morning where I have little use for it, to the evening where I
really enjoy it.

In my opinion, the main problem with Daylight Savings Time is the change
that occurs twice a year. If it's so nice to have Daylight Savings Time in
Summer, is it really so harmful to have it in Winter as well?

It would be most unpleasant to have daylight savings in winter. It would
mean that it would still be dark at 9 in the morning! In the winter
you want more light in the morning, in the summer, more light in the
evening.
