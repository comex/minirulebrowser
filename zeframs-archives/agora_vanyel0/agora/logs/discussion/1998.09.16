Can you explain to me again why the current Rules do not allow commands
which appear in Proposals to have effect? It would seem from R594 that
they ought to be possible:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.

I remember that it was one of the intentions of your 'More Power to the
People' Proposal (P3445, adopted March 26, 1997) that this should be
possible, and that self-repealing Rules would no longer be necessary. I
also seem to recall that we discovered, as a result of my 'Restore Game
Balance' Proposals (the first of which employed such commands), that
those intentions had not been satisfied. But I no longer remember how
the argument went.

I agree with you that Proposals ought to be given broader powers to
command, and such like, but I doubt that a sweeping reform is necessary
to achieve that aim. Probably tinkering a little with R594 and related
Rules would be sufficient.

Their VTs are worth more than voting on a Proposal.  They will still be
reluctant to vote.  The real problem here is that you found the balance you
were looking for and now you don't like that it's one with such a low rate
of voting.  Giving people the choice of how to throw away hyper-valuable VTs
isn't the solution.  Increase VT supply to a more reasonable level and I
think you will find that players will once more find voting is more in line
with the value they place on a VT.

Proposals have no power to command (or constrain) Player actions.
Only Rules have that authority.  I would change that: only Adopted
Proposals have the power to command Players.  The published Rules
would only include those sections of adopted Proposals which state
rules of a 'general and permanent nature' (although all adopted
Proposals become law, the Rulekeepor would be permitted to omit from
eir publications those which have been repealed or otherwise lost
governing force, which have applicability limited to a specific,
narrow, nonrepeating context, or are otherwise not of a 'general and
permanent nature').

The problem that "tinkering with R594" leaves is the recordation of
adopted Proposals when a Proposal contains a provision which is a Rule
in all but name.  Either you have to fiddle around with some sort of
arbitrary limits on the ability of adopted Proposals to command
Players, or live with the possibility of there being 'de facto' Rules
which do not appear in the Rules because they were merely provisions
of adopted Proposals, not specifically commanded to be encoded into
any Rule, but binding on one or more Players for the indefinite
future.  My approach embraces this problem and turns it into an
advantage, instead of trying to corner it and put a cage around it to
keep it under control.

R1862 permits the Assessor to lower the Voting Tariff to 0.5 VTs, but no
lower. But even if such a dramatic reduction in the price of voting were
possible, what would be the point? Lowering the Voting Tariff to 0.2 VTs
is more or less equivalent to raising the BOS back to 1 VT, and the
results would be more or less the same: inflation, ie many more VTs
entering circulation than leaving. 

What we're trying to achieve here is an increase in the absolute size of
the economy, ie the number of VTs actually being spent. I'd like to see
us get to a situation where 20 VTs per week were being spent on voting.
Then we really could raise the BOS to 1 VT (higher, even), and still
have the economy in balance. That's why I hope that Players will support
my Proposal 'A Duty to Vote', if Promotor Blob ever gets around to
distributing it.

Surely the Total Credits should equal the Total Debts? Something's gone
wrong...

I have no record of you paying to raise its Priority, so I'm afraid its
still sitting in the Queue. With all your repeals recently, you are quite
wealthy in P-Notes, so I did not see any need to use my Promotor's Privilege
for your sake.

I also think that the bonus for repeal is excessive, especially considering
the current lack of P-Note spending. I think I'll propose its repeal, or
at least reduce it to just 1 P-Note.

I think I will adopt the 15 character version: I'm not bothered by
losing seconds, and even though my compsci instincts are not entirely
happy about losing the leading '19' in the year, I can live with that.
There are more columns available in the Blue Pages than I first
thought.

There aren't any rules out there that attempt to override the above.
You had been Inactive continuously for two months, so you became
Silent.  Then I asserted that you had Abandoned, so you were
deregistered.  End of story.  

If you want to Play, why not register?

Michael.
PS: I might have acted differently if you hadn't just days before said
that you were unlikely to come off hold at any near stage in the
future.

I did think of this.  When I accused Swann of Silence, he was not
simultaneously posting to the Public Forum, so he was not becoming
Noisy.  However, at that time he had been Inactive for two months
continuously, so he became Silent.  

Players deemed to have abandoned are not restricted in their ability
to re-register so if Swann does actually want to Play, then he can
register. 

Michael.

Ah, I overlooked that definition of "inactive" in R1016 (as a synonym
for "on hold"). So I thought that rebelling was an "activity" and made
the two months start over again. But really, just being on hold for
more than 2 months is enough to get you deregistered. Thanks for the
explanations (also to Scott).

You wouldn't even have to lose that if you get rid of the unneccessary spaces:
'30Aug1998 17:28' isn't too hard to read.

I think I will adopt the 15 character version: I'm not bothered by
losing seconds, and even though my compsci instincts are not entirely
happy about losing the leading '19' in the year, I can live with that.
There are more columns available in the Blue Pages than I first
thought.

It did make you noisy - but after that, being Inactive continuously for
2 months made you Silent.

In case you didn't see it, Blob, I argue that this CFJ is FALSE, on the
grounds that R1817 requires RKs to note transfers in the order in which
they are received. Ignoring a TO until after another transfer has
occurred violates this provision.

I'm tempted to transfer a Kudo from both of you. Not so much for doing
such a corrupt deal (for corrupt deals are a part of the game), but for
doing it so shamelessly in public.

Personally, I think Speaker Murphy should exercise his right to report
the FtR Infractions, to remind Crito, and any other Players who might be
tempted to try to cut such a deal, that they have to deal with the
Speaker as well as the Registrar, and to remind Registrar Michael that
he shouldn't make promises he's not in a position to keep.

I'm not actually arguing against increasing VT supply. VT supply is
basically a function of the BOS. I'm arguing that we should lower the
VTCL, effectively shortening the time that Players can hang on to VTs
before they get hit by taxes. If we were to lower the VTCL, I think
we should probably go for a simultaneous increase in the BOS. (The BOS
has room to rise anyway, since we've just repealed Offices worth 5
BOS/week.) Perhaps a doubling of the BOS to 0.8 might be in order.

Sorry, but how can you possibly demonstrate such a thing?
