A couple of things about this proto:

1) I forgot to include Oerjan's suggestion to allow Groups and Contests
   to pay for priority increases. The change has been made in v1.2, but 
   there's not much point in reposting.

2) I'm not sure about the "Decreasing Priority" rule. I think it needs
   to be Plato-Pragmatised, but I don't know what would be the best way
   to do it.

3) I followed Steve's suggestion, and gave a 2 VT reward to the proposer
   if a proposal passes. I have not included a penalty if the proposal
   fails. Any comments?

4) I wanted the Promotor to publish the Proposal Queue each week, but
   to be able to do so without officially distributing the proposals.
   I'm not quite sure how well I've done that.

   Thinking about it, we would probably not want the Promotor to publish
   the entire text of every proposal in the queue, every week, but e   
   should be allowed to publish the text of yet-to-be distributed 
   proposals, (and required to when asked, by the FOIA).

5) The phrase "A Proposal is Emergency if..." is ugly :p. It would be 
   much nicer to call them "Urgent Proposals". 

And further suggestions for improvement?

It also conflicts with the initial provision that a Proposal's
priority be an integral value.  I suggest that what you do instead is
allow the Promotor discretion to reduce the priority of any Proposal
that has been in the Queue for a whole month by one, or if it is has a
Priority of zero, remove it from the Queue entirely.  This removes any
hint of automatic actions, and gives the Promotor something more to
do.

I suggest that it might be sufficient to amend the relevant rule to
state that a Proposal Distribution is only such if it is only
explicitly labelled as such.  (This follows the precedent set by the
way we do CFJs and Proposal submission.)

Yeah, this would also be nice.

I agree; change the name.

I don't see this as particularly undesirable.  Once the Indulgence
situation is sorted out (I assume there is a consensus to the effect
that Oerjan's original conception of there being a net excess of Blots
is still seen as what we should be aiming for), 2 Blots will be much
more significant than the VT penalty, so the fact that the VT penalty
is not huge doesn't seem such a big deal. 

In any case, the Assessor's salary should be reduced with the passage
of the Omnibus Reform Act (though I don't think I noticed this
provision; Scott?), because they will no longer be responsible for VT
recordkeeping.  

And finally, Officers can't afford to just ignore the Failure to
Report Infraction forever; the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty kicks
in after three successive failures.

Michael.

I agree with Steve here.  For example, are we sure that the rules for
Executors etc are stable enough to ensure that an Indentured Player
can't be made to rack up more penalties in the course of being someone
else's slave, and thus be Lawless as soon as their period of Indenture
finishes?

Quite the opposite, in fact - some penalties accrue to Executors 
rather than the Players they are Executors of, if anything I think 
having slaves may be a liability...

I believe this, and similar Plans already announced, are
objectionable on the grounds that I pointed out, i.e. that no
entities in Probate are currently terminal. I've decided not to
lodge Objections myself, though.

One, you are not a Player, and are therefore not empowered to Object,
and two, such an objection lacks foundation.

(The necessity for Probate becomes more obvious now that there exist
several means for instituting Payment Orders, neither the Payor nor
the Payee of which the Bank, exist.  I expect we'll see an
Organizational Payment Order before too long.)

I hear that this is considered good practice (Crito also suggested
this and had a reason for it too I think), though I don't claim to
understand why, and it sounds fun.

I see nothing requiring objections to Probate plans to come from Players.
R1738 makes no reference to the Without Objection mechanism (which does
only allow Objections from Players).

True, but it was legally made, and can therefore only be nullified by
a CFJ.  Conveniently, such a CFJ has already been called.

I don't like this RGB-like forcing of scarcity, I am afraid. I would
much prefer a more economic solution, and I can imagine three ways to
do it. Really the problem is that more VTs are entering circulation
than leaving it. So I'd like to suggest the following protos:


1. Increase spending: allow everyone to cast up to five votes,
say. This would reduce the relative value of extra votes like the
speaker's or those of the champion's reward, but apart from that it's
easy to implement: simply change the last paragraph of 206 to read

      Each Voting Entity has five votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than eight votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes may only
      be achieved by the casting of Voting Tokens, as specified in
      other Rules.


2. Increase spending by abolishing presence (repeal 1715 and remove
the references to presence in the quorum rules). This is another way
to force more spending of VTs.


3. Reduce VT input - e.g. stick to VT stipends, but reduce them to one
VT for three proposals, maximum three, by amending 1684 to 

      When the last Voting Period on a Proposal distributed in a given
      Nomic Week ends, the Assessor shall pay out to each each Player
      who cast a vote on any Proposal distributed during that Nomic
      Week 1/3 as many Voting Tokens as there were Proposals
      distributed in that Week (rounded down to the nearest integer),
      or 3 Voting Tokens, whichever is less.


I'd prefer these to one-off reductions of the number of VTs, only to
see overall VT holdings rise again because the reasons for inflation
remain the same.

I don't like the idea of adding so much paperwork to simple exchanges
of currency between players. And I doubt that fixing "exchange rates"
makes a lot of sense, given the very low amount of interplayer dealing
that is going on.

Very feeble.  Why?  What's the point?  OK, I see the point of
the exchange officer (although I don't necessarily agree with
it) but the rest of the proto seems rather pointless.  Can't this
be done privately?

I'll try to tweak the proto to allow various Auction modes, including 
this, as an extra feature - but expect me to give up quickly if it 
gets too hairy. ;)

Actually someone else suggested this.  Sorry, but I forget who.  IIRC, e stated
that this practice results in higher bids with values closer to the true value,
since there is less incentive to bid low to get a bargain - bid high and hope
you get a bargain out of the previous bid.  8)

A few quick comments.

1. I like this and will support it.

2. Forget about fractional reductions in priority
and go with the suggestion of reducing priorities
by one for every four (or whatever) weeks it
hasn't been distributed.  Mandate or allow the
Promotor to discard proposals whose priorities
would go negative.

3. Adjust the distribution rule to make
distributions occur only if explicitly marked as
such (as someone else suggested).

4. Have the status changes of proposals officially
occur when the status change is reported by the
Promotor in the Queue Report (or the proposal is
distributed).  Have discarded proposals listed as
such in the report for some period of time (four
weeks or whatever).

It encourages people to bid "honestly" (what they're actually willing
to pay), rather than trying to guess what the second-highest
bid will be and bid only slightly more than that.

Nice idea.

I don't like this; It would probably create problems with deciding whether

I see Scam potential here - I think it would have been safer to allow only
extra AGAINST Votes.

And I am not sure that last sentence means what you think it means - it
might very well nullify the rest of the Rule.

Unfortunately I see you have already Proposed this.

The goal is to ensure that the success of a procedure is known immediately
after it is reported - that does not leave room for ignoring errors. 
Having an error take definitive effect is a feature not a bug :-)

My sub-Proto is called so for a reason:  It would have to be embedded
within some system to correct errors after the fact.  Which I assume the
Omnibus act is (I still haven't got around to read it properly...)

Such a system could be an improvement on the current system in that it
could allow errors to stand if they were insignificant, or to correct only
the immediate errors and not further consequences that cause the complete
recalculations we are so fond of (NOT).

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I don't know about the Wizard, but the Rulekeepor certainly appreciates
it if Rule texts are indented 6 spaces, and no more than 70 characters
(including the indentation) wide.  (I don't mind if brief replacements--
less than a paragraph--don't conform to this.)
