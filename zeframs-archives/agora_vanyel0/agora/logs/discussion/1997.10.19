Another challenging problem with this particular meta-rule is that it
neglects to consider the fact that the Rules themselves determine who
is and is not a Player.  What would be the effect of the following two
Rules:

Rule 2001: William Jefferson Clinton is a Player.
Rule 2002: The President of the United States shall declare Agora's
Birthday a national holiday, before January 1, 1998.

Any argument that denies Rule 2002 force because the Rules can only
bind Players is lacking because Rule 2001 declares Mr. Clinton to be a
Player.

The "sphere of influence" is more practical than metaphysical. If we were
to hire a paramilitary force to enforce Rules among non-Players, that
would be a large increase in our sphere of influence. The examples
discussed are effective precisely because they involve having power over
certain non-Players (in ChrisM's case, the power to deny a desired
registration). I see no thoretical limit to our power over non-Players.

Well, I have to separate myself from this argument; except for the rule 
about no punishments worse than deregistration, I think this would be a 
perfectly valid rule. Of course, I also think the ability to quit the 
game at any time is guaranteed by a metarule, so we wouldn't all have to 
off ourselves.

No, I'm not talking about practical limitations. I think a Rule requiring 
Clinton to declare an Agoran National Holiday would be null and void even 
if we enforced it with force. (Do you think the CIA or Secret Service is 
monitoring this list? :)  Now, a rule requiring *players* to organize a 
force to cause Clinton to do something, that's a different story. I 
haven't thought about that enough yet to say what I think about it.

I concur in that assessment.  The Rules lack power over non-Players
generally because non-Players have no interest in abiding by the
Rules.  Contrariwise, the reason why the Rules can constrain
prospective Players is presumably because such prospective Players
have an interest in abiding by the Rules, in order to become Players.

Of course, "interest" can be voluntary or coerced; in our case, it is
wholly voluntary.  Vlad's suggestion of hiring a paramilitary force
would add an interesting, if expensive, element of coercion to the
equation.

They are now :-). I'm not sure how you would consider such a Rule
null and void. It exists. It is enforced. How is it void?

I'm not sure why making it a requirement makes it more effective.

I don't know. If I didn't quit, I would believe myself to be breaking a 
Rule.

Because we have no legal basis for enforcing it; it would be like trying 
to enforce U.S. laws on a citizen of Nigeria who has had *no* involvement 
with the United States. I suppose you could say that it's not "null and 
void," if you're going to enforce it, but if you're going to do that, why 
even pass a Rule about it? You have no more "right" to enforce it *with* 
a rule than you do without. (Referring to legal/theoretical rights, not 
moral rights.)

Because now the Rule is operating in a domain where it has authority: the 
Players of Agora. It's not requiring the President to do anything; it's 
requiring the Players to do something.

Actually, we don't want people sending Players On Hold into Quietude,
do we?  How about:

       If a Player posts to the PF clearly identifying another Player
       who is Here and Active, and alleging that e is making that
       Player become Quiet, then that Player becomes Quiet.  [etc.]

Reuse of terms is okay in the presence of other distinguishing
evidence.  Contrast "If Player X alleges that Player Y is Quiet,
then Player Y becomes Quiet" with "If Player X alleges that e is
making Player Y become Quiet, then Player Y becomes Quiet".

18 USC 175 prohibits persons everywhere, no matter where they may be,
from developing, producing, stockpiling, transferring, acquiring,
retaining, or possessing biological weapons.  The United States
asserts the right to prosecute this crime whenever committed by or
against a citizen or national of the United States.

Some nations are even more extensive in claiming the right to enforce
their laws outside their borders.
