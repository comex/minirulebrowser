I'm sorry not to have explained things.  I did decide rather than just
forget however. 

My reasoning is that I should sit back and wait for a little while
yet.  When we see if Crito has to start imposing lots of taxes, then
that will be a case for lowering the BOS.  I don't want to be the
cause of further unnecessary oscillations.  Let's allow the economy to
settle down a bit.

I'm adopting a wait and see attitude. I want get Blob's opinion on
what the effects of Plot Repair will be, since he has pointed out
several flaws in it, and is working on a repair bill of his own,
which seems much more extensive.

I'm a bit disappointed that you haven't exercised your power to set
the BOS, nor given an explanation of your decision (if it was a
decision, and not merely the result of forgetfulness or lack of time)
not to do so.

I consider the current system to be badly broken.  I'd like to see the problems
with Transfer Orders and Orders in general cleared up before we implement a
completely new economic paradigm such as Plots.  The way Plots are broken at
the moment, they have no discernable effect on the game.  I find this more
desirable at the moment.

Well, fair enough I suppose. Nevertheless, I think it's pretty clear
what the input/output situation for VTs basically is: with the BOS
set at 1, we have 21 VTs/week coming in for Salaries. P3754 will put
back unemployment benefits if it passes, another 4 VTs/week. In
a good week (ie one where Players expend substantial VTs on voting),
I reckon about half of that would be returned to the Bank. So without
intervention, we can be pretty sure that the number of VTs/Player in
circulation will increase by about 1 per week. Next week or the week
following, Crito will probably have to levy a tax.

The flaws aren't so much with Plots Repair itself, but with the already
existing Plots rules. The three most significant bugs are these:

1) As Executor of the Bank, the Chancellor is free to transfer its 
   Plots to any Player.

2) Maintenance Fees need to be charged after Production is paid out,
   or else nothing will happen.

3) The Production Rates are too high, with no means of tuning them.

None of these are really dire, as long as the Cartographor and 
Chancellor act sensibly and responsibly. But I'd rather fix things
first. If Plot Repair was passed, I'd recommend that nobody buys any
Plots until we've fixed things, rather than having to "reset" Plots
ownership again at a later data.

In other words, we'd be better off not passing P3753, and waiting for
your bill.

Yes... but I'm not sure when my bill will be proposed. I've done a lot
of work on it, and it's coming together, but really to do it properly I
need to implement something very similar to Transfer Orders, with the
ability to have them disputed and vacated, which is quite a complex 
issue, and not one I feel confident in addressing fully.

Fortunately, there doesn't appear to be a need for Payment Orders,
and there is no instance in which one can get into debt wrt Plots.
