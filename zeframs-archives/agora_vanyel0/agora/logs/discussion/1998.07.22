Doubtful. I thought conclusion of the debate was that any message of
the form "I hereby make myself ineligible to Judge <some set of future
CFJs>" is ineffective, for the reason that one can only make oneself
ineligible to Judge specific CFJs.

My Proposals 3766 and 3771 can go into your assemblage. Do you have the
texts?

I transfer 1 VT to the Bank to satisfy the first Payment Order.  The
second will just have to go on my tab, for now...

How about making the reward go to the second person to vote?  That
way, the contest is still an interesting one even with Public Voting.

It would be nice to be able to able to send mail to an Officer to the same
address regardless of who that Officer is and have it automatically
forwarded to the individual holding the Officer.  Could something like this
be set up?

Blob,

Don't worry about this one.  I haven't had a chance to set up my transfer of
information to you, but I will be doing this shortly.  I'll send you a report
that is up-to-date as of the sending of it, including these latest business
transactions.

I just realised that as Accountor, I am not supposed to blithely delete
messages like Michael's. This is against my habit, and I haven't been
paying the attention to these things that I ought to. Sorry. 

If anyone has recently made a PO or a TO for VTs, which hasn't been 
reported yet, would they please forward me a copy for informational
purposes?

As a favor to Murphy I am going to deny this delayed TO on the grounds that it
is delayed.  Note that you forgot to specify what the transfer is for.  If I
had allowed it, you would have just wasted an Indulgence.  8)

I don't know about forwarding, but there are free web based email accounts.
We could open one for each office.

Just a thought.

It could be, but I'm not sure what would be achieved by it. Someone
(logically, it would be the Registrar) would have to maintain the
service so that it always pointed to the correct Player. There would
be a significant chance that during periods of Officer Transition, the
pointers would be wrong for some period of time, reintroducing the
problem of messages going to the wrong Player.

Yuck.

Actually, my company may be getting its own server soon; if we do, I
may register nomic.org and virtual host it, which would allow me to
set up secondary domains for whichever nomics want it, including email
forwarding.

I don't think the two cases are similar. The latter discussion, which
concerned the effects of PC, involved serious logical issues, as a look
at the relevant CFJ will show. The QM 'objections' to Waggie's scam were
sheer ad-hockery.
