I'm not so certain about that. Morendil is a Player because he is
the Speaker - because, in other words, of R103. R1714 has a strong
precedence claim, but it still loses any conflict it has with a
Power 3 Rule like R103.

Of course, R103 could not prevent Morendil's deregistration for
Lawlessness if he had ceased to be Speaker, having been replaced
by the new Speaker-Elect. But it's actually an interesting question
whether Morendil will continue to be a Player once he is replaced
as Speaker.

We have traditionally held the view that being registered is necessary
and sufficient for being a Player. The current situation may force us
to drop the view that it is necessary. It is certainly a possible view
of Morendil's current status that he is a non-registered Player.

I think my meaning is clear enough. I shelter in the warm embrace of
R754. Next time, I'll be more exact.

If Michael's Judgement of CFJ 1063 stands, some or all of these will
have to be reconsidered.

Rule 1714 and Rule 103 are not in conflict, however, because Rule 1714
also removes a Lawless Speaker from the Speakership.  If the Speaker
is correctly alleged to be Lawless, the Speaker-Elect immediately
becomes Speaker.  Thus Rule 1714 sidesteps Rule 103.

Probably not.  Rule 869 is the governing law as to who is a Player,
except when trumped by Rule 103.  And Rule 869 holds that any person
who is registered as a Player is a Player.  Applying that canon of
interpretation I mentioned earlier, this implies that any person who
is not registered as a Player is not a Player.  Morendil is not
registered as a Player, and thus would not be one except for Rule 103
getting in the way.

This also suggests that the Speaker can, in fact, deregister or be
deregistered, but that e continues to be a Player until e ceases to be
Speaker.  The past interpretation has been that the Speaker cannot
deregister or be deregistered, which may in fact be in error.

Another point: if Morendil has not been registered, then e does not
receive eir Fugitive Blots.

Yes, but which ones?  Michael's Judgement asserts that units of
Currency are incapable of possessing Currency, but does not provide a
clear standard for what entities _are_ so capable.

A few minor tidbits if this is indeed the case: Morendil would not be
counted for the purpose of determining the value of Quorum, need not
appear in the White Pages, cannot invoke Rule 113 (because he is not
registered), is obviously not a Senator, and remains a terminal estate
in Probate.

Game History can be, and frequently is, bogus.  I don't believe the
example you cite has much strength as game custom, as it was an
isolated case that had no effect on anything and was regarded by all
and sundry as an intellectual curiosity.

Rule 1714 does not conflict with Rule 103. It ensures that a Lawless
Speaker first ceases to be the Speaker before that Player is
deregistered.

This has been settled (by Proposal):

Rule 204/1 (Mutable)

      Every proposal shall contain one or more rule changes. 

   Initial Mutable Rule 204, Aug 01 1996
   Amended by Proposal 312b, Nov 13, 1996, by Agora

Rule 311/1 (Mutable)

A rule change takes effect at the moment the proposal containing it is 
adopted. If the rule change is a rule creation, the rule created gets a 
rulenumber equal to the lowest integer equal to or higher than the number 
of the proposal that is not the number of an existing rule. For the
purpose of this rule, different rule changes in one proposal are regarded 
to take place subsequently in the order in which they are given in the 
proposal. 

   Initial Mutable Rule 210, Aug 01 1996
   Amended by Proposal 311b, Nov 13, 1996, by Agora

Oh, by the way, doesn't this imply that you have NOT sent the original
IN Proposal to the moderator, and so still are in an obligation to do
so?

Not in most of the United States.  Americans generally have no legal

No shit. This is the _third_ time someone makes a flawed,
non-proto-Proposed Amnesty Proposal. Expect my AGAINST Vote.

The flaw is even the same as in the previous one.

After the introduction of Presence, ABSTAINs were retained merely for the
case when you wanted to change your vote. As you say, they cost VTs.

Now, ABSTAINs are really obsolete, after Pragmatic Currencies(?) 
introduced the ability to really retract Votes. Use declarations of
Presence instead (customarily marked by *).

No Vote (-) is now often used for the case were you are slightly against a
Proposal, but not enough to waste a VT.

In order from strong disagreement to strong support, you now have the
options (unless you have extra Voting rights):

2       twice AGAINST (2A)
1       AGAINST (A)
0       no vote (-)
0       declaration of Presence (*)
1       FOR (F)
2       twice FOR (2F)

Feel free to CFJ on this, but I would say that the message I sent to

Fortunately, several (although not all) states have passed "Good
Samaritan" laws creating a statutory bar prohibiting damages (or
criminal prosecutions) resulting from "good faith efforts to render
aid".

There have even been a few cases of people being tried for battery for
attempting CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.

Actually, paranoid as I am, I did check some of those messages for whether
something new had been hidden there.

No, you didn't miss anything.  The rule is that *Fugitive* Blots are halved. 
Fugitive Blots have no relation to real Blots, other than to be a counter of
how many real Blots you had when you deregistered.  The above figures are the
real Blots, which are supposed to have been vacated by EiPs. These are not
halved by any Rule, which is why a Fugitive who re-registers at this point ends
up getting double or one and a half times the Blots they had when they left.

This is my interpretation.  Morendil has not reregistered and therefore R1437

I think there's sufficient game custom to establish a synonymity between
"register" and "become a Player", and between "deregister" and "cease
to be a Player".  It's certainly a possible interpretation of "a Player
is anyone who is registered as a Player".

I thought it was precedence relations that established Morendil is a Player in
spite of not being registered, rather than the above interpretation.

Ooops, right. Sorry. That restriction is particularly frustrating in

Of course, if EiPs did their jobs (instead of wantonly ignoring their

No, I was arguing that given the above, the Rules *should* not
attempt to impose obligations on non-Players.  I offered
a different suggested wording of the "Pay $20 to play" Rule
which does not, IMO, impose any obligation on non-Players,
either morally or legally.

Becuase I can attempt to register without sending in $20, and even
if I wish my attempt to be successful, I am not violating the
Rule.

But the Herald doesn't have the authority to vacate the POs until

I would tend to think that "Infracations which have been reported
incorrectly" have not been reported at all.  How do I know when something
is actually an Infraction reported incorrectly?  If you say,

"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
 Did gyre and gimble in the wabe..."

How do I know that's not an incorrectly reported infraction?  Where
is the line between "incorrectly reported but still valid" and
"incorrectly reported and invalid?"

One possible interpretation.

Just common sense.  The above statement makes no mention about an Infraction
defined in our Rules, in any language.  As it stands, an incorrectly reported
Infraction either is a report of an Infraction that did not actually occur, or
is the report of an Infraction that has been attributed to the wrong person,
which should be obvious from the text.

The point is moot for this discussion now anyway, since I needed to correct the
situation caused by the bug in the Rules that prevents me from vacating my own
POs.  I have admitted my own COE on the misattributed Infractions and have
reported them now correctly.  I am reasonably confident that all outstanding PI
Infractions have now been reported.  I'm just waiting for a volunteer temporary
Herald.

For those of you without C compilers, this program will (given infinite
time, and infinite memory) generate all strings over the characters
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ ,."' (including the double quote, excluding
the single ones).  It produces them sorted in order of length, with
strings of equal length sorted in lexical order.

Of course, Kojen failed to specify how the program was to be run to
produce its output.  It is not possible for it to run forever - if the
machine doesn't run out of memory fast enough, the sun will run out of
fuel.

Additionally, I'm sure that many Players (especially Officers!) will agree
that one cannot simply state that "I do X at time Y", and have that
statement interpreted as a Game Move, when it cannot be determined what X
is until considerably after time Y.

Incidentally, there are many other, neater, ways of generating all
possible strings.  Why use C?  (If you wanted to obfuscate your intent,
there are also better ways of doing that.  I could provide you with an
encoding of a Turing Machine to generate all strings easily enough).

I don't know how effective that provision in R1558 really is. How can
we be sure that Morendil would not be permitted to hold the Office
of Speaker-Elect? Sure, if he's Speaker he won't be allowed to hold
it by R1647 as you point out, but how do we know that he'll still 
be Speaker when the Election ends?

The problem is that the game custom can just as well be interpreted
as making registering merely a sufficient but not necessary condition
for being a Player. The possibility of becoming a Player without
registering has never arisen before.

Still, I agree that both interpretations are viable. Perhaps we should
get a Court ruling on the matter.

The high precedence of R103 indeed establishes that Morendil is a
Player. The question is: does that imply that he is therefore registered?
Zefram is putting the case that it does, based on the premise that
'being registered' and 'being a Player' are synonymous. Another possibility
is that it doesn't, based on the premise the 'being registered' is only
a sufficient condition, but not a necessary one. for 'being a Player'.

Hm. I'm not sure if I've read that Judgement or not. My feeling is
that Elde cannot be Blob's EiP because Elde was deregistered for
Lawlessness, on Oct 4. (He has just yesterday become eligible to be 
reregistered.) Didn't we agree that an EiP has to be a Player? 
(You remember the argument: by R1738 and EiP is an Executor, and
by R1478 an Executor is a Player, so an EiP must be a Player.)

It provides a standard as clear as commonsense is. My feeling is that
none of Zefram's parting transfers meet that standard, since they were
all intended to violate it.

Of course, there's no particular reason to think that that canon
of interpretation has much applicability in Agora, is there? Unless
that CFJ Swann mentioned he made has any bearing...

I'm less willing than you to overturn prior game custom in this area,
which I regard as well established and strong. The arguments I've put
forward regarding the relationship between 'being registered' and
'being a Player' are consistent with game custom, since the question
of whether being registered is necessary, and not merely sufficient,
for being a Player has never really arisen before.

What about the relationship between 'being deregistered' and 'ceasing to
be a Player'? If there is prior game custom that the Speaker cannot
be deregistered because that would violate R103 which requires the Speaker
to be a Player, then I would take that as indicating that it is game
custom that being deregistered is a sufficient condition for ceasing to
be a Player. It's probably true that the question of whether being
deregistered is necessary for ceasing to be a Player has also never
arisen before, but, unlike the question about registration and being
a Player, that question remains of little interest at this time.

I think I can. R1478 empowers me to act on Swann's behalf as if I
were Swann. 

My understanding of Player/EiP powers, based on recent Judgements, is
that the Player can do anything that has not been specifically
assigned to Executors, (so the Player can declare Presence but cannot
vote, for instance), but that the Executor can do anything, period.
(Anything, that is, that a Player can do, eg both vote and declare
Presence.)

Do you have the datestamp of Morendil's announcement? Although
R1717 (The Senate) is not completely clear exactly which moment
we are to count backward from in order to determine who is a Senator,
it makes sense to count from the time the Proposal becomes a Senate
Proposal.

In this respect, Vir becomes an interesting case: he registered at
Thu, 04 Sep 1997 13:48:14 -0500. Morendil's announcement was made
sometime on 04 Nov. Before or after 18:48:14 UTC? That will determine
whether Vir is a Senator or not.

If the times are very close, we might we want to examine the headers
of Vir's registration message more closely, if that is possible.

I'm working on the rest of the list.

Actually, the headers of your reply to Morendil state that it was
sent:

In-reply-to: Your message of "Tue, 04 Nov 1997 18:11:48 +0100."
             <199711041711.SAA18991@logatome.micronet.fr>

Ie, Morendil's announcement was made at 04 Nov 17:11:48 UTC. This 
means that Vir is about an hour and a half short of being registered
for the two months immediately preceding the time at which P3581 
became a Senate Proposal. Hence he is not a Senator for that Proposal
and cannot vote on it. He can, I think, declare Presence on it.

Not that it makes much difference here, but the above date is my
"last transition" date (when I last came off hold), and not my
registration date, which would have been in late August or early
September 1993.

The same is true for many other Players. The dates listed are taken
directly from the Registrar's Report and are not intended to indicate
the date of last registration.
