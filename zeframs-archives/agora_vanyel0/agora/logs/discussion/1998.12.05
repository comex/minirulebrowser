No problem. That's what Objections are for. ;)

In general, for the same reason we introduced Ratification in the
first place; namely, that it would be good to know that at a given
point in time the Game State and our perception of it were in sync.

In this paticular instance, I noticed that the Speaker, as well as
individual Officers, is empowered to post a motion for Ratification,
and I thought it would be useful to do so.

> If you have strong reasons for puuting all records in a clear state,

Individual Officers should regularly move to have their own Reports
ratified. As I see it the Speaker's role is to remind them of that
now and then, which I've done. ;)

Yes, that's very true. I'd really like to see officers ratifying their
reports now and then. And if they don't all do it simultaneously, and
label it as a routine ratification, we'll even have a chance to glance
over the reports and make sure they're ok and it's not necessary to
object.

Re-reading the Rules, I see that this is of no effect, because Michael
was already removed from the Office before I made this statement. Thus,
Morendil, as Speaker, is holder of the Office of Chancellor, making my
above posting a statement on the Public Forum, but not an official
report.
