Nice.  It might be helpful to say that this rule defers to R698
"Always an eligible judge" (though you may not want to refer to the
rule explicitly).  I believe that this deferral is sufficiently
important to be explicitly noted, though it will be true by default
when adopted because of their relative rule numbers.

Never rely on someone else's opinion as to what the law says; always
read it yourself and make your own conclusion. :)

First, the definition of Currency is redrafted to make designation the
key determinant, not qualification.  Presently, something is not a
Currency even if designated as such if it fails to meet certain
conditions.  This is anti-pragmatic, and I have moved away from this
position.  If the circumstances surrounding a Currency change such
that it is improper for it to remain a Currency, then the designation
should be affirmatively revoked (by Proposal, Chancellor action, or
Judicial Order).

Recordkeepors need not be Players, but a non-Player Recordkeepor is
still subject to the jurisdiction of the Rules.  Currencies may have
any number of Mintors.

Transfers, creations, and destructions are done by notice to the
Recordkeepor.  Transfer Orders are abolished.  Proposed Rule 1817 sets
out which sorts of transfers the RK is required to record.  Other
transfers may be recorded at the RK's discretion.

Payment Orders are also abolished and replaced by a more general
concept of debt.  Debts may be reduced to Orders when they become
overdue.  It is possible (but not required) for entities to track as a
matter of course only the total debt due to em by each other entity;
individual debts need not be tracked with particularity until a
dispute arises.

Notices of Debt are used for the formal imposition of debts, and are
mainly a means for Officers to formally convey the finding of fact
that the Rules have created a "public" debt (i.e. one involving the
Bank).

Probate has been technically rewritten, mainly to avoid a conflict in
language with the current use of the term "debt" in the Probate Code.
It has also been simplified somewhat and some procedural streamlining
added.  Some minor tinkering has taken place with respect to Wills.
No substantial change in the law is intended; mostly, these are
procedural simplifications and conforming amendments.

The tax rules are amended to conform with the substance of this
legislation.

Voting debts are segregated by having them be due to a new entity, the
Voting Bank.  Any overdue debt to the Voting Bank results in the
Infraction of Debt Voting.  Note that the new Rules allow prepayment
of debts, so you could make a large deposit in the Voting Bank if you
wanted.

Group Coins are eliminated.  A Group who wants Coins can either beg
the Chancellor to designate them, or seek to get a Proposal adopted to
the same end.

The remainder of the amendments are conformal.

I'm afraid that I don't agree with the conclusion that the TO was invalid. 
Note that R1478 quoted above does *not* say that failing to identify oneself as
an Executor causes the specified action to be invalid.  It merely forces
everyone to *presume* the action was taken on ones own behalf.  In this case,
it would mean we must presume that Michael, on his own behalf, tried to
transfer an Indulgence from X-Group to the Bank.  But now look at R1598 and
R1817:

Rule 1598/7 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an Order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  A valid Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.  If a Transfer Order...

Rule 1817/0 (Power=1)
Recordkeepors' Obedience to Transfer Orders

      A Recordkeepor is required to abide by all valid Transfer Orders
      submitted by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an...


Note that R1598 does *not* require the issuer of a TO to be the executor of the
source entity in order for it to be valid.  Michael's TO was a valid TO, by any
interpretation of R1598.  This brings us to R1817, which is supposed to prevent
anyone who is not the executor of an entity from being able to transfer from
that entity.  If Michael had *not* been the executor of the X-Group, then R1817
would have relieved the Herald of the requirement to abide by this TO. 
However, Michael *is* the executor.  And, since it was a valid TO, the Herald
*is* required to abide by it.  The purpose Steve alludes to in eir last
sentence is a noble and desireable one.  Unfortunately the Rules, as written,
do not serve that purpose.  I'm afraid R1817 is written in a way that puts the
responsibility of determining whether a TO issuer is authorized squarely on the
shoulders of the RK.

I consider the original TO to have been successful and will deny any COE that
seeks to claim otherwise.  If you disagree with my analysis here, please CFJ.
