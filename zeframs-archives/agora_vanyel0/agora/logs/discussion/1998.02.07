Not at all !  I like it !  This is the sort of stuff that Jesters sit in
beer halls and sing about.  :o)
There once was a Nomic that split,
Over whether dereg. was legit,
Whether e'd stay,
Or be on eir way,
Was the problem that Malenkai hit.

While over a judgement they fought,
(Who was the Clerk of the Court),
On went the game,
Proposals they came,
But they ended up counting for nought.

I know this poem aint great,
But here the time is quite late,
If you can do better,
Then write out a letter,
And send it to Agora mate !

<Jester puts down eir lute and beats a hasty retreat to the bar>

<Where e orders a MILK ?!>
