Well, that'll get your message to the list admin, ie me. But you can
unsubscribe directly by sending mail to <majordomo@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au>
with

unsubscribe nomic-official
unsubscribe nomic-business
unsubscribe nomic-discussion

in the body of the message, and similarly for the backup lists. But
never mind, I'll do it for you.

No, I've got my phone connected now. I'm considering going On Hold

I thought *-request should work as well - it's mentioned in the message
for the yoyo list, though not the others.  To contact you would be
*-owner.

####
Proto-Proposal
The Levers of Monetary Policy

[Comment: this Proposal introduces two new levers for control over
monetary policy: it gives the Accountor the ability, by levying
taxes, to keep the number of VTs in circulation limited to what I
have called the Voting Token Circulation Level, which e can set, and
it give the Chancellor the power to set the Basic Officer Salary. The
aim here is to give us flexibility; we can adjust important economic
parameters without having to pass a Proposal. Also, these decisions
then become a matter of Officer politics, which should be interesting.
I have written the Taxation Rule so that it covers the cases of other
Currencies, should we wish to extend the use of this tool to cover them.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Circulation of Voting
Tokens" be created with the following text:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules. 

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Levying Taxes" be created
with the following text:

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank. Finally, the announcement must contain Payment
      Orders naming each entity in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.

with text which reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of
      Voting Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "The Chancellor can set
the Basic Officer Salary" be created with the following text:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 2 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the Week.
