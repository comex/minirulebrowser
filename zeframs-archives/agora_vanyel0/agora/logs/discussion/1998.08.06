Or, we could try to co-exist as a separate "state" with it's own law,
within the same "world", if they were willing to let us carve out a bit
of space of our own where Agoran Law, not SW Law was sovereign.

I like the idea of playing on a MUD, but only if we can avoid the 
problems that eventually scuttled Nomic World. I was an Apprentice 
Wizard there, at least for a brief time toward the end, and I know some
of the strain that was on Geoff, to keep the world in sync with the 
rules.

If we do move to a MUD (and I haven't heard anyone complain about the
idea yet - is there anyone who would not have access to the MUD if we
did?), we would have to construct our rules carefully. Rules should
legislate the behaviour of players, not the physics of the world. If
we want the world's programming to be changed in a certain way, then
the rules should recognise that a certain player is going to have to
make the change, that it is going to take time, and that the flexibility
we have in interpreting rules will not necessarily be reflected in the
code.

This last point is a major one. We need to draw a strong division 
between "possibility" and "permissability". The rules make certain actions
permissable (or impermissable, or mandatory) but the code makes them
possible or impossible. Just because something is permissable, does not
mean that we should expect the code to make it possible, and vice versa.

I have read Morendil's proto now, and completely agree with Scott's

An interesting idea, in some ways more promising than mine. I spent
a very brief time poking around Shattered World this afternoon, and
I noticed that:

1. The strong prey on the weak. As new citizens, we'd all be very weak.
   To get stronger we'd have to develop new, MUD-style skills. Do we
   have the time and energy for that?

2. SW has an elected Judge who enforces the Law, and may do so in a
   relatively arbitrary way. It's not clear to me that we could preserve
   our own judicial system within such a framework. Convincing them to
   give up theirs doesn't seem a very likely prospect.

Strong agreement from me.

Oerjan was definitely correct to locate the trouble that Harlequin
is having receiving some messages at ussenterprise.ufp.org. The
following shows an example of the machine inserting a spurious period
into harlequin's address, rather than the agora lists'.

Yikes.  I was going to say that I had no way of telling, but in fact,
I have a .bash_history that tells me I did do 
  echo $[ $RANDOM % 8 ]

Thanks for the sharp eyes.  (Because I have to start counting at zero
when I figure out who has been selected, I probably counted from zero
to determine how many there were in this case.)

Anyway, given that there hasn't been a judgement returned, I think
redoing the selection will be minimally disruptive.  Corrected
assignment to follow.

Michael.

(That URL is stale BTW)

I think the example of .Nomic is instructive.  In my opinion they
tried to achieve too much far too fast.  They didn't so much hit the
ground running, as hit it sprinting.  It doesn't surprise me that they
crashed and burned: they were using an unreliable medium, and within
seconds they were trying to build a miniature Civilisation game into
what they were doing. 

Incidentally, as Ambassador, do you have any feeling for how the other
Internomic participants are doing at the moment?  What is Ackanomic up
to? 

Michael.

I was a little hesitant to suggest moving to SW if our presence might
swamp the game.  If it's the nomic that only has 10-15 Players and
there are more playing the MUD as a whole, then I don't have any
qualms at all.

Havning briefly skimmed over recent contributions, protos etc
concerning an Agora-MOO connection here are a few of my ideas.

1. I'd very much like to preserve Agora as a functioning, email based
nomic to have a solid basis for the whole adventure. So I'm sceptical
about merging with other nomics, or performing Agora relevant actions
in some MOO (with the possible exception of actions that are either
not very important for Agora's gamestate, or only concern the state of
subunits of Agora, like contests, whose problems, crashes etc can be
isolated from Agora in general).

2. I don't think we should try to regulate the physics of such a MOO
with Agora rules (which put obligations on the MOO wizards that these
wizards may or may not be able/willing to meet). In this sense I agree
with Scott's criticism of Morendil's proto.

Part of the original challenge set by Michael (or whoever it was who
brought the whole idea up in the first place) was to confront Agora
with a physical world whose laws Agora can _not_ immediately
influence.

The fun would then be in 

- giving some Agora related meaning to actions performed in the MOO
(yes, I admit this is kind of a contradiction to what I said in 1. - I
guess I would just like to see a secure interface between Agora and
the MOO, e.g. such that a transfer of some economy items in the MOO
does not automatically imply a corresponding transfer of Agora
entities, but rather triggers the obligation on an Agora afficer to
issue a PO, a reward or order some other Agora activity which is then
performed according to Agora rules).

- regulating the behavior of Agora players within the MOO. But not via
"physical" limitations (i.e. write code that makes a particular action
impossible), but rather with legal limitations - make it illegal to do
things that are physically possible in the MOO (i.e. codable or
doable). This would allow us to get situations where we don't need to
nitpick about permissible vs possible, and some situations closer to
real lawyers' experience.

Just to give you a general feel for what I have in mind, some Agora
rules that coupe Agora entities to the MOO might be:

 Agorans may only build a new MOO location after transferring 10 Agora
 Ergs to the bank.

 At the end of each month, the Chancellor shall pay out 5 Agora VTs to
 the player who owns the largest amount of MOO dollars.

 When an Agora CFJ alledging that an Agoran stole a MOO item from
 another MOO player is judged true, the CotC shall bill the thief
 2 indulgences.

And so on.

This is an attempt at reworking the ideas of my original proto into
something closer to that suggested by, among others, Scott and Kolja.

Rather than try to institute a two-way correspondence between the
Rules and MOO 'physics', it merely gives legal recognition to the
MOO as Agora's 'virtual territory', gives the Ruleset jurisdiction
over it, and creates a category of non-voting members called
Citizens. It also makes for a much simpler Proto, and one we can
consider adopting as a Proposal much faster.

Proto-Proposal
---
The World of Agora

 I - Enabling legislation

 A Rule Category shall be created : "Agoran Physics", into which
 all Rules enacted by part I of this Proposal shall be placed.

 A Rule shall be created (titled "The Agoraverse") with text : 

   The Agoran community shall maintain an electronic virtual reality of
   a sort which allows  individuals participating in the virtual
   reality to interact with each other and with the virtual environment.
   The nature of this environment and the manner of its operation shall
   be at the discretion of the Gamemaster, within the boundaries
   established by the Rules. This virtual reality shall be known as the
   Agoraverse.

[Incorporates some of Scott's language, adopts Agoraverse as a sexier 
alternative to "EVR".]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Citizens, Players and Resident") with text : 

   Individuals who participate in the Agoraverse shall be known
   as Residents. Any requirements imposed by the Rules on Players
   applies equally to Residents, as if they were Players.

   This Rule shall not be construed so as require Residents to be
   Players or Players to be Residents, although any individual may
   elect to be both a Player and a Resident, at eir discretion. 
   Neither shall this Rule be construed so as to extend to Residents
   any prerogative of Players (such as the right to Vote); or to
   count Residents as Players for any purpose (such as determining
   Quorum).

   The term "Citizen" shall refer to all individuals who are Players,
   or Residents, or both.

[Adopts some of Scott's language and most of the ideas. Uses the
term 'Resident' for Agoraverse participants, so as to free 'Citizen'
for use as a generic term encompassing both kinds of Agorans.]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "Permissibility of the physically
 possible") with text :

   Any action which may be performed in the Agoraverse by a Resident 
   is legal and permitted, unless specifically prohibited by the Rules.

[The Agoraverse's equivalent of Rule 116. Yes, it is redundant with
116, but in this case I am of the opinion that redundancy doesn't
hurt, because we might want to amend that Rule later on, either by
adding exceptions of the sort 116 contains, or even by turning it
into a "Prohibition of the unpermitted" Rule.]

 A Rule shall be created (titled "The Gamemaster") with text : 

   There shall exist an Office of the Gamemaster, with the duty of
   overseeing the operation of the Agoraverse. The Gamemaster shall
   be authorized, Without Objection, to designate a specific virtual
   reality as being the Agoraverse.

[Scott's suggestion again. Please note : this makes it possible
either to use AgoraMOO as the Agoraverse, or implement Steve's
suggestion e.g. by designating Shattered Worlds as the AV.]

 II - A few basic Agoraverse Rules

 [These are mostly intended as examples.]

 A Rule Category shall be created : "The Agoraverse", into which
 all Rules enacted by part I of this Proposal shall be placed.

 Create a Rule with title "Psychotic Gamemaster" :

   If a CFJ alleging that the Gamemaster has made continued
   use of the Agoraverse impossible is found TRUE, e shall be
   removed from the Office immediately.

[A basic safety mechanism.]

 Create a Rule with title "Agoraverse immigration policy" :

   It shall be illegal for the Gamemaster to restrict the operation of
   the Agoraverse in such a manner that a Player of Agora shall be
   unable to create at least one character for eirself with no
   particular registration procedure being required. The Gamemaster
   may otherwise restrict character creation, within reason, as
   required to ensure that operating the Agoraverse does not become
   unpractical for em.

[A fairly open immigration policy.]

 Create a Rule with title "Respect the Agoraverse Rules" :

   The body of text displayed upon typing 'help rules' in the 
   Agoraverse shall be an SLC, having as its Jurisdiction all
   Residents and the Gamemaster as its Maintainer, known as
   the Agoraverse Constitution.

[One possible interface between Agora and Agoraverse. This makes
Resident Players liable for 3-Blot penalties for violation of the Rules.
We'll need to find a suitable system of penalties for non-Player 
Residents, of course.]

 Create a Rule with title "Restrict Resident's powers" :

   The Gamemaster shall only be empowered to grant 'programmer' powers to
   Residents who are Senators of Agora, or to other Residents Without
   Objection. Granting 'programmer' powers in any other fashion
   constitutes the Crime of Gamemaster Irresponsibility, a Class B Crime.

[What I have in mind if we initially use AgoraMOO as the Agoraverse
is an 'Anything goes' policy at the start, where any Players can add 
their own bits to the Agoraverse. However, it is probably not safe to
allow just anyone to be a programmer. Then again, it might be fun to
make *all* MOO users programmers by default.]

 Create a Rule with title "Restriction on real estate development" :

   If at any time the number of distinct locations (or "rooms") 
   within the Agoraverse exceeds 20, it shall be prohibited to
   build a new location without transferring either 1 Erg to the
   Bank, or 100 MOO dollars to the MOO bank. This shall
   constitute an Infraction with a penalty of 1 Blot, in addition
   to which the Gamemaster shall be empowered to remove
   the offending location and levy a fine of 100 MOO dollars
   on the offender.

[Expands on an idea of Kolja's.]

 Create a Rule with title "Capitalism" :

   At the end of each month, the Gamemaster shall order the Score of
   the Player other than the Gamemaster who owns the largest amount of
   MOO dollars to be raised by 5.

[Another idea of Kolja's, slightly reworked.]

Before I start, I'll just introduce myself briefly. I'm Tom Walmsley and I
subscribed to the mailing lists the other day as a watcher with a possible
intent to join at some point in the future. My email address is
t.walmsley@lineone.net if for some reason anyone wants to reach me.

As a former player of .Nomic I believe that this is finally something I am
qualified to talk about. There were several reasons for the death of .Nomic
which on there own would probably not have been insurmountable but together
killed us off entirely. One of these was the poor propogation on the
newsgroup, which made the tasks of the officers impossible as they had to
do things they didn't know they had to do. This was further compounded by
the fact that the majority of players kept voting more work on essentially
just two people with one other doing a little bit. We weren't in a good
position, but as was mentioned there was a proposal to move us over to a
mailing list and we probably would have survived if it passed. However,
most of our players were at Cambridge University and soall went away at the
same time causing said proposal to fail quorum. That was what finally
killed us.

I believe that a lot of the former players are now playing NomiCam (link
from the nomic ring I think) which has revived quite a few of the old ideas.

Tom.

While some of the introductory specific regulations you propose are
interesting, I don't think any of them are necessary in the initial
stages.  Frankly, I would like to merely start the MUD and react to
situations as they arise, rather than trying to guess what appropriate
legislation will be for an environment that we know practically
nothing about anyway.

I don't know if I like that.  Personally, I don't think the Gamemaster
should be able to change, merely W/O, the entire VR like that.  Once a
venue is selected, that venue should remain selected.  Any change
after that point is one which should be subject to debate and
discussion.

Hm.  I just had a really interesting idea for a completely different
game mechanic.  I'll have to think about it.  (It largely eliminates
Proposals, which is why it's completely different).

Hi and welcome! Nice to have you around.

Thanks for the info on .Nomic. I hope my short summary of the game
didn't sound as if I didn't care about that game. In fact, I did check
the web page regularly, followiong the civ-like developments with
great interest (and, to be hnest, a certain degree of scepticism
whether you'd ever be able to make this work). 

And the crash due to the bug in the reassignment of points after a win
by scoring [aside to Agorans: IIRC, the rule for automatic events
after a points win was flawed. After the first win it doubled the
points needed to win and reset players' points values in such a way
that the win condition was immediately fulfilled again, so it went
into an infniite loop of wins and doubling of the point threshold
needed for a win...] surely was a classic Nomic crash, and (in a
nomic-theretical sense, this is not Schadenfreude) fun to watch.

Your wishes are granted, then; AgoraMOO is running. ;) Feel free to

Well, the problem is that we don't have an intermediate mechanism
between WO and Proposals. But the Proto can certainly be tweaked
to allow the initial venue to be specified WO, and later changed by
the operation of a Proposal.

Another nit: I'd prefer "Resident" for "user of the MUD", "Citizen"
for "voting member of Agora", and "Player" to encompass both.  Doing
this, however, will require a rather icky global search and replace in
the Rules as they now stand.  

Anybody mind replacing "Player" with "Citizen"?

I suggest keeping Player as it is.    The new term Resident could
encompass both player and no-Player mud users.  A Citizen could to mean
Player using the mud , and  we could have Resident Aliens, for
non-Player residents.  

All clear?

Both 'Player' and 'Resident' seem to have the standard meaning of
'users of the MOO' to the MOO community itself. We should be
using one of the two for the MOOers.

I like this as a starting point for further developments.

One minor point:
>>
   The Gamemaster shall only be empowered to grant 'programmer' powers to
   Residents who are Senators of Agora, or to other Residents Without
   Objection. Granting 'programmer' powers in any other fashion
   constitutes the Crime of Gamemaster Irresponsibility, a Class B Crime.
<<

For rules like this the it matters where such things are
communicated. I guess that part of the Agora-Agoraverse interface
must be a requirement that things like granting citizenship, or
programmers' rights, must be published on the Agora PF to be legal.

Rules like this, BTW, imply that we have physical control of the
Agoraverse, something which is not true for Shattered Worlds, and
makes us very dependent on a particular Gamemaster (whose removal,
while legal, would effectively kill the Agoraverse maintained by em).

Probably we'll have to limit Agora rules even more. 

I like the open form of the rule "The Gamemaster" and "Psychotic
Gamemaster" because they allow a flexible response to difficult
situations. But the GameMaster should be limited to deciding what the
Agoraverse is. It should not be necessary for em to have controling
access to the Agoraverse. Similarly, we might find it difficult to
make rules that cover anything but the player (or maybe low-level
builder wizard) activities of Agorans. Otherwise we'll run into all
the trouble of coupling rules to a technical reality beyond our
control (technical on the level of MOOs, servers, wizards etc, not on
the virtual reality level created on this basis).

The first fwe sample rules also require technical control of the
Agoraverse to work, while the last few ones would also work if they
only govern Agora players who happen to participate in a M** on the
simplest possible user level.

The "Capitalism" rule already works like this; "Restriction on real
estate development" would probably have to be rephrased by removing
the technical level penalty (of removing the offending location) and
keeping penalties on a purely Agora level (blots, fees etc). 

Just my 2c.

Kolja

P.S. I've already begun some simple building work in AgoraMOO, so if
you'd like to drop by you can at least see some construction sites...

All (or nearly all) Rule Changes (and other changes as well) are
initiated Without Objection.  If an objection arises, then upon the
insistence of any one Player other than the proposer or the objecter,
the matter is taken to a vote.

There are, of course, a lot of details that would need to be worked
out. :)

I dunno.  It seems to me that if something like the first paragraph
above could be adopted as a rule with a sufficiently high MI, it would
have exactly the desired effect without much (any?) further work being
required.

Wow, go away for two days and we've turned into a MOO. :)

I must say, I do think this idea of "extending" Agora is an interesting
one, and certainly has some potential. However, I have a caveat.

A number of people have mentioned that Agora is "stale"; because of it's
self-referential, circular nature, there's very little real "purpose" to
our convoluted legal noodlings. Fair enough. But from my experience, I have
to question the amount of "purpose" in your average MUD-style "virtual
world" as well. Once the novelty of manipulating objects and moving between
rooms wears off, there has to be something interesting to do -- otherwise
we're just transplanting our existing problem from Agora to AgoraMOO. 

Among all these posts, I haven't heard anyone suggest anything for us to
*do* in the MOO other than wander around and talk to one another. IMHO, we
should determine this before we make any plans to actually implement it.

This is _not_ what I'm proposing we do with a MUD.  What I want to do
is open the MUD up to the public and let people engage in behaviors on
it that we can then regulate.  We can also erect an economy and do
other amusing things, using our "guests" as a part of the simulation
that is not entirely under our control.  Brave New World.  Fun stuff.

The exact nature of what we "build" is open.  In fact, under the proto
I've floated, the Engineer would have almost unbridled discretion to
do anything at all.  Let the Engineer establish a MUD that will
attract players.  That's all I care about.  The rest will happen on
its own.

Leftover Loophole Cleaning

Rule 1766 is amended to read as follows;

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by a Voting Entity.

Revamp New Player Incentives.

Rule 1677 is amended to read as follows;

     Upon commencement of a new Player's Grace period, the Registrar 
     shall pay out to that Player 3 VTs and 1 P-Note.

{Comment: Followed Oerjan's suggestion, giving newbies a Blot amnesty
          rather than an Indulgence.  Note, I lowered the award.}
          

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Blot Amnesty During the Grace Period)

     If a Player is subject to an Infraction during eir Grace period, e 
     shall not be billed any Indulgences due to that Infraction.  This 
     Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require or permit 
     that Player to be billed for those Indulgences.

     If the Rules specify a Player receive a specific number of Blots* 
     and those Blots are not the result of a Crime* and those Blots are 
     to be applied during that Player's Grace period, then those Blots 
     shall not be applied. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that 
     would require or permit that Player to receive those Blots.

{Comment: Instead of giving the new Player an Indulgence, this makes 
          them partially immune to Blots* with the exception of Crimes, 
          which are a rare and grave matter.}


Rule 1701 is amended by deleting the following phrase;

     "Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player."

{Comment: Moved it to 1677.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Grace Period Proposals)

     If a Proposal has been submitted by a Player during eir Grace 
     Period then that Proposal shall have an initial Priority of one.  
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify a different 
     initial Priority.

Rule 1442 is amended to read as follows;

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

      However, If the votes were cast by a Player during eir Grace 
      period, then the Assessor shall instead bill that Player a number 
      of Voting Tokens equal to half the votes cast by that Player.

{Comment: These are both intended to serve the same purpose as giving a
          newbie some starting currency, without flooding the market 
          with VTs and P-Notes.  Also, a shrewd newbie has the 
          opportunity to raise capital by selling eir cheaper actions at 
          a profit.}

Tweak the Taxation Rules

[Comment: two minor fixes to the taxation Rules. The first changes the
definition of 'in circulation' to exclude Currency already owed to the
Bank (this fixes the bug which would otherwise require the Accountor to
Levy Taxes, after e has just done so, but before any taxes have been paid).
The second lifts the requirement that the taxation POs actually be made
in the same message as the taxation announcement, and removes the silly
requirement that the Accountor tax the Bank. As a bonus, I include the
repeal of R1838 (Tabula Rasa), which should have been provided with an
auto-repeal mechanism, but wasn't due to an oversight on my part.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1852 (Circulation of Voting Tokens) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank. 

with text which reads:

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the 
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

Be it further resolved that R1853 (Levying Taxes) be amended by replacing
in it the text which currently reads:

      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after making the announcement, the
      Accountor is required to execute Payment Orders naming each
      entity other than the Bank in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.

{Comment: Does anyone believe that a Power one rule can effectively
restrict the Power of any Rule with Higher Precedence?}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title:Minimum Power of Rules}

     All Rules shall have a Power of one or greater.  No Rule shall have 
     a Power less than one.  This Rule takes precedence over all other

Rule 1753 is amended by deleting the following paragraph;

     "For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule."

{Comment: The ROM Rule has been amended to have the Promotor explicitly
          submit the ROM's Proposals to the PF, a much more natural time 
          of submission.}

>3775 Swann          1 Ratification and Reporting Tweaks F/Q     0-0
Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the 
past couple of years, some ambiguity and a few outright contradictions 
crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's 
Report/Official Document confusion.  There are now Officer's Reports, 
which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an
      Officer's Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Officer's Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Officer's Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.


Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the appropriate Officer posts the intent to Ratify 
     in the Public Forum, and the Ratification is Executed when the 
     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post 
     that the Ratification has been made.

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

I spoke to Geoff last night and followed up with him Blob's idea
of having our own area of Shattered World, rather than trying to
merge the two Rulesets. Geoff thought the idea had merit.

Shattered World is quite large, and programming changes are about to
make it a fair bit larger. There are a number of citites and towns,
but basically, only one, Sanom City, is really occupied at the moment.
There's a significant business/political side to Shattered World now,
and obviously all the citizens tend to congregate in one area to do
their business. So Sanom City is highly developed and busy.

But, as I say, there are other cities and towns that are not being used.
Geoff mentioned a city called Merenth, "a city in the trees" he called
it, which might make a suitable place for an Agoran colony. The idea
would be that we would declare Merenth and it surrounds the "Agoran
Autonomous Region" or somesuch (given the slightly medieval flavour of
Shattered World, probably "the Land of Agora" would be more
appropriate.) From there we'd have a measure of privacy to settle in,
while still being able to venture into the world outside. Citizens of SW
would be subject to our laws only while in the Region; Citizens of Agora
might be subject to Agoran law, or parts of it, even when in Sanom City.
But that would be a question of how Agoran law would develop in the new
environment. The advantage for SW would be having a whole new region
being developed which is currently lying fallow. The interactions
between the two political systems (the Monarchy in Sanom City and the
more democratic institutions in Agora) would generate a lot of interest
on both sides. I think.

It's quite an exciting idea, in my opinion, but there are also
difficulties to be overcome. The most fundamental, in my view, are the
problems arising from the change of paradigm from email-based play to
MUD-based play. In Agora as it has developed, basically all actions
consist of sending different types of email messages. In a MUD, most
actions consist of manipulating virtual objects directly via the MUD
program. Our Rules have been written for the former kind of play, not
the latter. We'd have to do quite a lot of work changing over. On the
other hand, SW has Notice Boards, and with a couple or three of them, we
could probably manage a transitional period during which actions could
still consist of sending messages, albeit to notice boards on SW. It may
also be possible to link the notice boards to the mailing lists.
Eventually, though, we'd probably want to take advantage of SW's easy
play with virtual objects, and reify things like Voting Tokens, P-Notes
and Indulgences into "real" virtual objects (that is to say, objects
recognized as existing by the MUD program and tracked by it, not by us.)

I guess that falls under my purview, as both Assessor and Archivist.
I will forward you the distributions containing those Proposals.

No need to include this in any collection of bug fixes you're planning
to propose; P3765 repealed R1766.

I just thought I'd let people know in a semi-official kind of way that
I'm going to delay the announcements of the results of Proposals
3778-3780 for 6 days, until after the self-amendemnt to R1764 has taken
effect. This will avoid any legal complications arising from having
two paragraphs in one Rule, both of which claim that they themselves are
the only effective paragraphs in the Rule, should P3780 happen to have
passed.

It is considerations like these that lead me to prefer the option of
colonizing Shattered World than starting our own MUD or MOO. An enormous
amount of work has already gone into Shattered World. It already has a
very complex environment with which players can interact, not to mention
it's players and political system, and it's own economic system, with
which ours could come to interact on many levels.

I am opposed to moving the primary medium of Agora to a MUD.  I have
friends who MUD, and I have lived through the agonized phone calls they
give me when their MUD crashes.  It isn't pretty.  We in Agora have
lived through listservers crashing and now have backup lists. Even if
we didn't, a regular report gives us the email addresses of the
Players, and other reports would allow us to recover should the current
listserver die.  Our currencies are kept track of by us, not by an
object in a MUD.  I think moving the public forum to a MUD would be a
dangerous radical step.  It is easy enough to rebuild Agora on a new
mail list; A good MUD isn't as easy to rebuild.

I am for adding a MUD as a dimension in Agora.  I think adding  on to a
new MUD could kick start the economy, if done right.  I am much less
interested in being a part of and established MUD.

I don't think we should shift from email-based play.  For a variety of
reasons, I think that the legislative and administrative business of
Agora should continue to be conducted in email.

The notion of cohabitating with Shattered World is interesting.
However, I don't think that either system is ready to resolve things
like conflict of laws which will arise when two legal systems come
into contact like that.  (Believe me, this is nasty enough in real
life.)

A number of people have expressed this desire, which is perfectly
understandable. If it were possible to link notice boards in SW to the
mailing lists, so that everything that appeared on the notice boards
would also appeal on the mailing lists, would some of your concerns be
met?

Of course, the requirement that all the administrative business of the
game be conducted by email does seriously limit the ways in which we can
integrate ourselves into any MUD. For example, we could not allow Voting
Tokens to be reified in the game while preserving this requirement. At
some point you have to decide whether a transfer of VTs is achieved by
sending an email message, or performing an action in the MUD. You can
have one or the other, but not both. 

There would remain areas for exploration though. SW already has its own
Coin economy, and this could interact with ours. The SW program would
keep track of Coins, while we would use our Recordkeeping system to keep
track of VTs.

Still, insisting on retaining the email-based nature of the game does
lessen the excitement of the proposal, at least for me. The more radical
idea of trying to convert Agora into a wholly MUD-based Nomic seems more
challenging, and to hold out more potential for future interest.

Perhaps we don't have to choose. If enough other Players were interested
in forming a colonizing party to settle the SW city of Merenth as I've
suggested, we could simply start the process on our own, and take our
own copy of the Ruleset with us, effectively forking the game state.
We wouldn't even have to quit playing Agora to do it.

For the benefit of those who have joined us in the last 10 months,
here is Zefram's updated version of an idea of favor's.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Fork (v1.1)

favor's old idea, updated to use Applications (which seem a particularly
appropriate mechanism for this).

v1.1: Added specifications of Parent Nomic and Incept Date.  Reworded more
gramatically.  Came up with a more flexible form of PF sharing.

###

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "The Fork",
reading

      The Fork Depth of Agora is 0.  The Parent Nomic of Agora is Nomic
      World.  The Incept Date of Agora is 29th June 1993, 12:04:30 UTC.

      There is a type of Application known as an Application to Fork,
      the purpose of which is to create a new nomic.  Such an Application
      is Executed by posting it to the Public Forum stating that one is
      doing so.  For an Application to Fork to take effect, when Executed:

      * it must state that it is an Application to Fork;

      * it must clearly identify a name for the nomic to be created,
        which cannot be "Agora";

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When an Application to Fork takes effect, a new nomic is created.
      The new nomic's game state, including all game history, is an
      exact duplicate of Agora's game state at that time, except that
      the following changes are applied in sequence:

      * Players whose signatures the Application does not bear cease to
        be Players.

      * All instances of the characters "Agora", including quoted
        instances, in the text of the Rules, are changed by replacing
        "Agora" with the name of the new nomic.

      * The first paragraph of this Rule is changed to read "The Fork
        Depth of <name> is <depth>.  The Parent Nomic of <name> is Agora.
        The Incept Date of <name> is <date>.", in which "<name>" is the
        name of the new nomic, "<depth>" is 1 greater than the Fork
        Depth of Agora, and "<date>" is the time of the Application
        taking effect, in the same form as the date at the end of the
        first paragraph of this Rule.

      * All Public Fora become Shared.

      * Any other changes clearly specified in the Application.

      * The effects of the Application, rather than to create a new nomic,
        were to make all the above changes to the game state.

Be it further resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Sharing the
Public Forum", reading

      Each medium designated as a Public Forum is either Shared or
      Unshared.  When the Registrar makes a medium a Public Forum,
      e may specify whether it is Shared or Unshared; if e does not,
      it is Unshared.  The Registrar is authorised to change a Public
      Forum between being Shared and Unshared, Without Objection.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, a message in a Shared
      Public Forum is thereby in the Public Forum only if it states
      clearly that it pertains to Agora.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, any message in a Public
      Forum is thereby in the Public Forum only if it does not state
      clearly that it does not pertain to Agora.

{The idea here is that any forked nomic could have its own dedicated
(Unshared) PF, and might itself have child nomics that share that PF
(it is for them Shared).  Messages to a PF by default pertain only to
the nomic for which that PF is Unshared.  With backup PFs, a nomic might
well have a mixture of Shared and Unshared PFs.}

Be it further resolved that all current Public Fora are Unshared.

I've forwarded a version of the proto-proposal to which I was referring.

By the way, lee, I'm getting messages from you twice, because you send
them to me directly and cc them to the list. That's not necessary;
messages sent to the lists alone will reach me.

I think we're all in agreement on that.
