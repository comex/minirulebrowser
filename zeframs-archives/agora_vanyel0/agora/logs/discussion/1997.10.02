I'd say they exist, like the Rules, as a product of the General Will. I
certainly think they can exist (or, more precisely, we can act as if they
existed) regardless of the Rules--in fact, we have. One might question
whether the VT's are the same in each case--but  I consider that
meaningless.

Depends on how old they are.  To me, a word is two bytes.  Four bytes
is a long.

Depends on the machine; I've used systems where a word was 1, 2, 4 or 8
bytes.  One of the more annoying legacies of the 8086 is people referring
to a two octet unit as a word, even on machines where it's not true.

Hm, for me it's the legacy of the PDP-11.  Two bytes is a word on a
VAX, even though the VAX had a 32 bit bus.

Interested in putting up a Concurring Opinion, Steve? I do agree with you that
3:2 is too generous towards the Officers, but se no reason to dispute
Oerjan's otherwise splendid Judgement.

No. If I waited long it's because I have about 300 unread agora-discussion

What's the point of multiple people appealing?  Does it prevent you from

No, we are just used to there being at least three calls for appeal required
for an appeal to be initiated, so people tend to jump on the bandwagon to

No.  It (normally) takes three calls for appeal, from different people,
in order to actually initiate an appeal.

Even the Registrar alone was not necessarily sufficint; there seems to
be some dispute about the number of Injunctions.

Sorry, I should have included the original (incorrect) information.  The last
two reports showed Blob with 11 Blots when it should have been 10.  Both those
reports were incorrect.  The above is how it should read and should have read
last week.

Dammit. I was utterly confused on this one until I looked back through 
the messages, and found one with a file attachment that I hadn't opened; 
in that attachment was my assignment as (pro-S) justice on the appeal. I 
suppose that's still the Public Forum, although I'm not sure it should 
be. So I admit the penalty.

BTW Andre, couldn't you issue a reminder or 1-day warning or something? 
Especially if you're going to bury assignments in file attachments.... :)

Aren't you required to report them not later than when you report the
Judgement or Default?

>I hereby request copies of CFJ 815 & 816, posted to the public forum, if
>available.

I hereby satisfy my own request :)  As per Andre's web page:

favor, 815:
If an amendment is made to the Rules governing the properties of any Game
Entity, then all such Game Entities stay in existence and have their 
properties changed to conform to the amendment.
Chuck, 816:
If an Entity, being redefined, retains the same name, then the Entity *is*
continuous if a continuity is at all possible.
The actions have to be specified in the Rules, but the specification may be
implicit.
If a new or amended Rule says that A is B, and A existed and was not B before 
the Rule or Amendment was adopted, then that Rule specifies that A becomes B.

Now, a question.

What applicability to CFJ 933 does CFJ 816 have?

A very good question, indeed.  I note that the "continuity" defined in
Rule 1586 was a direct response to CFJs 815 and 816.
