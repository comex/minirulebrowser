A couple of years ago I wrote an essay about Precedence and Mutability
(or Power, as it's now called), in which I argued that the stability
and smooth functioning of any legal system requires that there be a
close conceptual connection between precedence and resistance to
change. Actually, what 'stability and smooth functioning' amount to
are that precedence relations be stable and predictable enough to
enable smooth resolution of conflicts, and that rules be appropriately
resistant to change in proportion to their importance, ie their
precedence. So in fact there *are* good theoretical reasons why Power
could not be broken up into separate indices for precedence and
resistance to change. If these do not work together, they will not
work at all. So, actually I agree with Crito that it is commonsense
that a Rule of greater Power would win a conflict with a Rule of
lesser POwer, other things being equal. (If the lower Powered Rule
claimed precedence over the higher Powered Rule, matters might be
different.)

They might like to latch onto a broader community of possible
Players.  I dunno.  Perhaps it's too off-beat an idea.

What about starting off with a Proposal to force all member nomics to
enshrine Internomic law as supreme in their rulesets?  (If this
enshrinement wasn't done very effectively and the sub-game was able to
remove the requirement, then it would be seceding from IN.)

Thanks, Chuck, for encouraging us all in this important task. I did begin
to read it last week, but have only just now finished.  Too late for a
P-note award, but still it was altogether worth doing!

I'm not sure I want this.  Internomic Law is incredibly screwy at the
moment, and I don't think that we particularly want to step down to
their level, so to speak. 

I know I've put a lot of effort into "pragmatizing" our Rules.
Internomic is still very nearly pure Platonic (and pays the price for
it, too), and incorporating their law into our Rules might tend to
create schizophrenia.

Fair enough.  Perhaps we should first try and bring them into line
first.  You can always give a Pragmatic system a Platonic reading, as
it were, so a Pragmatic IN ruleset should be maximally compatible.

No, it is obviously necessary for someone to lift these primitive nomics
up into a civilized stable state, and who could better do this than the
oldest and most well-developed nomic?  It may seem like a lot of work, but
we must remember to follow our duty, regardless of how strenuous the Agora
Player's burden seems.

Fairly recently I read someone's post saying that they couldn't remeber seeing a
CFJ judgement that wasn't appealed. I've been witing for the appeal on this one and
it didn't come. Is this a first ?  Was the original poster wrong about appeals ?
Or is someone still going to appeal this judgement ?

All of these meanings are consistent with the natural meaning of "power".

True, but I am talking about the repeal as it stands with the current Ruleset.

Given the natural meaning of "power", it is a somewhat less arbitrary
determinant of precedence than numbers or titles.  Of course, if you
successfully argue that Power has absolutely nothing to do with "power" then
you would be correct that it is just as arbitrary.

>>
Kolja is just the man to do this of course, as he is Ambassador.  Does
he think there are any suitable victim nomics out there?  
<<

Well, maybe I can go through the list of IN members and say what I
remember about these nomics.

This is meant as a general information, but because the question was
asked, I'll also add short remarks about "takeover" potential.


Ackanomic

Besides Agora the only nomic that participates in IN regularly. They
play IN slowly and rather down to earth, no fancy stuff. Constructive
contributions to IN.

One of the old, well established nomics, with a good number of
players, maybe even more intense play than we have.

Probably much too stable, large and self-confident to be taken over by
us... 


Bluesmobile Nomic

Young nomic, not connected to any other IN members. Were enthusiastic
about IN at first, but have only cast one vote so far.

Connected to a regular, email based pbem "fanzine". I don't see why
they should be interested in joining Agora.


Micronomic II

I can't remember that they ever did anything in IN; IIRC, the website
shows no trace of internal activity for several months now.


New Rishonomic

Active, kind of veteran nomic ("New" because they crashed the original
Rishonomic). Participate in IN at a very low level (I can't remember
when they last did anything...)

Seem to enjoy ideas of conflict between nomics; would probably treat
a takeover offer as a kind of hostile act and try to play out a nomic
war (remember the talk about an Agora invasion of Rishonomic?).


Pumpkin Patch Nomic

Active and playing internally in a lighthearted, fun manner with all
kinds of weird concepts. Their IN participation is also governed by
funny rules that occasionally produce strange results, I think. Vote
very rarely (due to their voting rules, perhaps?), but delivered a
very carefully reasoned judgement recently.

Takeover potential: ??


Thring

Can't remember any IN activities of this nomic.


New Rishonnomic

Founded with the express goal of IN participation by yours truly and
Dan Knapp. Recently recruited several nomic newbies as players. Not
(yet?) a voting member. The name was an attempt to become voting
member using a typo in the IN rule that lists all voting members (the
attempt failed, though, which is why we have INP360 at the moment).

Has no dedicated mailing list at the moment; wouldn't reject an offer
to get a mailing list from someone, but I don't see what "joining"
Agora could gain us...


FDC Nomic

Run by another Agora player, Murphy. I can't remember any IN
activities besides registering as a nonvoting member, though.

Murphy, can you say more?


The Church of Odo on the Wormhole

This originally was an organization within Ackanomic. When its status
or even existence within Acka was in doubt due to Acka-internal
developments, it registered as a nonvoting IN member.

If they indeed don't exist anymore within Acka, they _might_ be
interested in finding a new home somewhere. However, their liaison to
IN is Uri Bruck, who, IIRC, is also involved with New Rishonomic, so
I'd expect a more conflict-oriented response if we approach them... I
think Uri is subscribed to our lists, so maybe Uri can say more about
this. BTW, Uri is also IN moderator at the moment. 

Just to make this clear: I'm not trying to say that Uri or New
Rishonomic resp. the Odo church would seriously ("out of character")
feel insulted if we approach them, or react in an immature or childish
way, just that I'd expect a conflict orientation of their "in
character" playing style.


.nomic

Not a voting member yet, but may soon be (INP316 or 362). Started to
make some good use of the newsgroup alt.games.nomic, conducts business
via email, discussion via the group.

Started less than two weeks ago, but is very active (ca 5 proposals a
day initially). Internally moving to a sort of Civilization-thing
(plots and much more...). Don't know how actively they'll play IN, but
I have the impression that many players there are also active in other
active IN member nomics.


So, this is a short rundown of the IN nomics. Any questions left?

I think the original poster exaggerated just a bit.  *I'm* not
going to appeal the Judgement, as I knew the maneuver was
somewhat questionable when I did it, and I'm willing
to accept the Judge's decision.

First of all, thanks for the summary of the nomics.  I really
appreciate it, and next time I have cause to deKudo someone, I will
send the Kudo your way. 

Secondly, the question.  What would our chances be in moving IN
towards a Pragmatic system (expressed Platonically if necessary) such
that we could then use it as an over-arching rule system to put our
current rules under? 

If Agora can't become an umbrella for multiple nomics and a large
player-ship, I'd be keen to pursue turning IN into the umbrella
instead.  But we'd have to be very involved in getting the umbrella
looking the way we want it. 

A first step might be the introduction of a pragmatic currency, which
all sub-nomics were forced to recognise and use.  This could be the
Coin, say, (standing for the Commerical Object of Inter-Nomic).

Michael.

Yes, but in the absence of a Rule, who's to say whether "power"
means one of those, two, or all three?  More importantly, if 1482
were repealed, Power would still retain its first and second functions,
and I see no reason to overload it with a third function not
specified in the Rules.

I disagree.  I would say that if all three functions of "Power"
were repealed, the most natural meaning of it would
be its first function, the ability to change other Rules.  (Of course, in
the light of 116, it couldn't do this merely on the strength of Game
Custom.)

I would argue that in the absence of a Rule telling us how
to determine precedence between conflicting Rules, the
precedence has to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
(this is currently the case with a Rule which conflicts
with itself--which, mercifully, does not happen very often.)

Micronomic II is dead, for all intents and purposes.

Thring is having problems with player retention, but plods on as best
they can.  One of the more Pragmatic Nomics out there, and IMO one of
the more interesting.  (Ackanomic, and especially Rishonomic, are too
tied up in trinket worship to be interesting.)

Hell, how else are we expected to test the law?  Agora's rules have
gotten complicated enough that the writing of case law is becoming an
important part of game play, and I, for one, welcome _REASONABLE_
attempts to push the boundaries.  (Unreasonable attempts will be
battered into submission with a Holy Stick of Smiting.)

This is how _I_ would adjudicate such matters.  I can't think of any
applicable precedent, however, so it would be very much up to the
Judge's discretion.

Here's where we differ.  I see the ability to resist changes and the ability to
win in a conflict both as part of the natural meaning of "power".  I don't see
one as an "overloading" of meaning.

Here we agree.  It's just that I suspect if the judges were to apply game
custom and common sense appropriately, the results would be the same in each
case as having the Rule.  Of course judges could ignore past custom and common
sense to establish new custom.

I, personally, consider that the explicit repeal of a Rule by adopted
Proposal which establishes a principle of law should be construed so
as to repudiate that principle's place in Game Custom as well.  The
Electorate has spoken, so to speak.  (I do not consider the same
principle to apply to nonproposed repeals, because such repeals may
not have the mandate of the Electorate.)  So in order to support
precedence by power in the absence of Rule 1482, I would have to argue
that such a relation is more obvious and natural than any other.  This
may be the case, but it need not necessarily be so.

As I said before, unless Agora offers something substantial to these
smaller nomics, they have no reason to join.  But let's take a real
hypothetical question here (as I have no idea of the possibility of
this): if Agora could offer NR a mailing list then would the latter
consider submitting itself (as an Organization or otherwise)?  Just an
improbable thought.

This batch came through just fine.  I think it was the non-7-bit

Could the Promotor please send P3688, P3689, and P3691 to me?

Yes.  This is where the most interesting question, to me, comes up (rather than
the issue of "common sense").  Usually the repeal of a Rule such as this would
be coupled with a new Rule or set of Rules that establishes a new principle to
supplant the old.  In that case there is no game custom consideration - the new
way is the new law.  But if, as is possible in this case, the electorate
repeals one principle without specifying a new one, the results are less clear.
I see three possible interpretations.

1.  In the absence of a new principle, the old one continues on as part of game
    custom - a kind of inertial game custom.

2.  The electorate has established what it does not want and so the original
    principle may *not* be used - a kind of inverse game custom.

3.  The electorate has decided to leave it up in the air, so to speak, leaving
    the door open for the courts (or other mechanisms) to decide the
    issue on whatever principle they want - opening the door for completely new
    game custom.

It sounds like Scott considers #2 to be the most natural interpretation.  At
the moment I have no reason to prefer any one of these over the other as the
most natural (and of course, others may think of more interpretations).  I am
curious as to which way this would be resolved in Agora.

Hm, vehement opposition to the Return of Points. What's your objection
to it?

Fairly recently I read someone's post saying that they couldn't
remeber seeing a CFJ judgement that wasn't appealed. I've been witing
for the appeal on this one and it didn't come. Is this a first ?  Was
the original poster wrong about appeals? Or is someone still going to
appeal this judgement ?

Well, Zefram said it, but I thought that was before you joined.
Someone, perhaps Andre, may have repeated it. In any case, there was
more than touch of hyperbole about the claim. Even when a lot of
CFJs are being Appealed, there are always plenty of CFJs that are not.

I agree with these remarks, but would go on to say that the precedence
relation defined in R1482 *is* more obvious and natural than any other,
because of the close conceptual connection between precedence and
resistance to change, the other function of the Power index. Note that
I wouldn't say the same about the precedence relation defined in R1030;
without that Rule, precedence might just as well go to the higher
Numbered Rule as the lower.

What method would you suggest for this--that InterNomic mints a
certain number of Coins and distributes them (equally? or by size?) to the
different members?  Otherwise, I'm not sure how you could control one
member from going mint-happy and spoiling it for the other members.
Also, I assume Coins could have different functions for each nomic;
would they be transferable then?

I'd be interested in working up a Proto for something like this,
unless someone else is already doing so.

However, it would be more work for Officers, who would have to maintain
individual mailing lists of their subscribers.

At the risk of appearing to issue an advisory opinion on the matter, I
tend to agree with these comments.  But I have not made up my mind on
it.

Curiously, the remaining presence of Rule 1030 would, in my opinion,
bolster this position.  If we have a Rule detailing the precedence
relation of Rules of equal Power, but none for those of unequal Power,
then obviously there is something about Power that obviates the need
to have a Rule specifically regulating the situation.

Or to any of a number of naturally applicable concepts, such as older
laws taking precedence over newer laws, and specific provisions take
precedence over more general provisions.  These two concepts basically
sum up American jurisprudence regarding conflict of laws of equal
standing.  The astute reader can probably think of any number of
arguably supportable alternatives.

Well, Officers who don't think it's worth the effort can just publish
their Reports in the Public Forum (for free, of course).
