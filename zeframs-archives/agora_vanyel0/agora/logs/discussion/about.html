<h1>Agora-discussion</h1>
After the traffic became too much for poor yoyo in August 1994,
nomic-discussion became the listserver where Agorans argued
interpretations, evaluated proposal ideas, and discussed Nomic
philosophy.  In the Big Move it became agora-discussion.  It is not a
requirement of Players to be subscribed to agora-discussion, so no
official business occurs there; it is, however, <em>highly</em>
recommended that all Players subscribe.
