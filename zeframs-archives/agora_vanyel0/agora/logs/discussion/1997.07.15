I would have thought _that_ as good a reason as any other - after all,
the point was rather forcefully made to me a while back that this is,
indeed, only a game.

I agree that I am somewhat disappointed not to have had a chance yet
to discuss this (obviously I spent some time thinking about it, and
my conclusions are not necessarily what you would expect...)

I couldn't agree more - and I'll add to that that the best interests
of the Game are not necessarily equivalent to the best interests of
any Player, or even a majority of Players, or even of all Players.

I'd be interested to know what y'all make of the effects on Blots of
the Pragmatic Currencies Proposal. This might help to shed new light
on the Mint Manipulation issue...

The new Rule 1435 would redefine a Blot thus : "A Payment Order for
1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the Bank, is called a Blot.".

First observation :

If it is indeed the case that Payment Orders are not Nomic Entities,
then we'd have to conclude that Rule 1586 would apply in this case,
and that any Blots held by Players prior to the adoption of P/C would
be destroyed upon adoption, always assuming that it _is_ adopted, of
course. If at this juncture Blots cease to be NEs, then there is no
longer any Nomic Entity that is a Blot defined by the Rules, and, by
Rule 1586, all previous such Entities are destroyed.

I do not think it matters much that Blots are 'aliased', so to speak,
with an amount of -1 Indulgences; they are nevertheless a Nomic Entity,
and Rule 1586 seems to apply, calling for the destruction of every
negative amount of Indulgences. Weirdness...

Second observation:

It makes little sense to think of a Blot, even in the new framework,
and the above notwithstanding, as _not_ being an Entity existing solely
by virtue of the Rules defining it to exist.

The previous (well, present) situation wrt Blots, IMHO, argues against
Steve's notion that we can gain better understanding of how Nomic
Entities are manipulated by equating them to poker chips. Say
Indulgences are blue chips; what are Blots ? I guess it would be
silly to argue that a Blot is minus one blue chip; for the poker chip
analogy to be useful, we'd have to imagine that a Blot is a red chip,
and that what actually happens when one receives a Blot is that one
is given a red chip, and that whenever someone has got a red chip and
at least one blue chip, e is supposed to return a red and a blue to
the pile. Players who have only red chips... well, as I said, Steve's
metaphor does not necessarily gain us much understanding - it requires
two distinct entities for positive and negative amounts of anything
that is a _single_ Nomic Entity. But it's perhaps interesting to
also apply it to Blots _after_ P/C.

There still is an Entity manipulated in this Game after the adoption
of P/C that is known as a Blot. Players receive them, amounts of them
are named as penalties. Rule 1435 states that when a Player gains Blots,
Payment Orders are executed; and that a Player "may be said to have"
a number of Blots equal to the amount of Indulgences assessed against
em. Going back to poker chips: in a face-to-face game, we'd probably go
on using reds to represent Blots. One could gain red chips, but the only
way one could get rid of one would be to satisfy a PO for one Indulgence.
The way to do that, of course, would be to give one blue chip to the
Bank...

Thus my next argument to support the notion that the M-Currencies can
be somehow - to what extent I don't know - conflated with POs and TOs
as defined by the Rules enacted by P/C : these very Rules come very
close themselves to equating POs and TOs to something that I doubt
very much is _not_ a Nomic Entity, the Blot.

I agree.  Blots are a Nomic Entity the way the rules define Nomic Entities.  I
hadn't thought of it before 8(, but I think it may be true, if the proposal
does not make any provision for Payment Orders to be issued for existing Blots,
then they won't be issued after the proposal passes.  It then becomes important
whether the phrase "a Payment Order for 1 Indulgence is called a Blot" makes a
Blot a Nomic Entity or not.  My initial take is that a Blot is still a Nomic
Entity.  Although a specific instance of a Payment Order is *not* a Nomic
Entity, Blots have no existence without the Rules.  The fact that the Rules say
you can represent a Blot with a kind of Payment Order does not change this. 
Interestingly, if this view holds and there are no Payment Orders issued for
existing Blots, it may require another proposal to allow Players to get rid of
their pre-PC Blots.  I'll have to think about this.

Agree (see above).

Actually, I don't think this equates POs and TOs to the Blot, it just forces us
to use POs and TOs to manipulate Blots (as we are forced to use POs and TOs to
manipulate Indulgences).

But that's not what the new 1435 says - it says that a Payment Order for
one Indulgence is _called_ a Blot. Thus it defines a Blot _as_ such a PO,
doesn't it ?

More bad news by the way - a Player's Blots are equal to the sum total
of Indulgence POs that have been executed minus those of that number
that have been disputed or vacated. What's missing is Indulgence POs
that have been _satisfied_, which is a serious bug; a Player who has
paid off eir Indulgence Debt is nevertheless Blotted. Also I think P/C
breaks Unity Vote, but those are the only problems I could find with
P/C other than the Big One, and for such a paradigm-upsetting reform
it's not so bad.

No, they're not.  Blots have been nothing more than a notational
convention since the adoption of Oerjan's Indulgences Proposal.  What
we call a Blot is merely a convenient name for a negative Indulgence,
just as a Mil was a convenient name for a collection of Marks.  All
P/C does is change the notational convention.

The ultimate provision of the Proposal accounts for that, by mandating
the creation of Payment Orders for negative quantities of currency
held.  Since a Blot is a negative quantity of Currency, a Player with
a negative quantity of Indulgences (e.g. Blots) will end up with a
Payment Order for Indulgences (e.g. Blots).

No, it means that, when a Rule says "Blot", it really means "a Payment

Quite possibly.  I don't care all that much. :)

But what is a notational convention, if not precisely a Nomic Entity ?
I fail to see any difference between the two, going by the definition
we seem to have of a Nomic Entity.

Hmm, next time I say I support a Proposal of yours you'll know exactly
what I mean, uh ? (Only joking - I do like P/C, and not only for all
the neat problems it raises.)

Now wait a minute - no one-liners, please. 1586 says that a NE is
"something that exists solely by virtue of the Rules". We are agreed
that a Blot exists solely by virtue of the Rules, right ? What we
disagree about is whether it is "something" at all, or whether there
are no such things as Blots, but rather a convention whereby ANY
language whatsoever in the Rules that assigns Blots to a Player
is to be taken as equivalent to "A Payment Order of N Indulgences
is to be submitted by the Player who detected the penalty with
the Bank as payee and the Player against whom the Penalty is
assessed as payor". This would have to hold whether the Rules in
question refer to "A Player gains N Blots", which your 1435/2 covers,
but also "A penalty of N Blots", which it does not, and any number
of other constructions referring to Blots.

Also your 1435/2 has a reference to "the Player responsible for
detecting the change in Blots". This would mean "the Player responsible
for detecting a change in the total amount of Indulgences named in
Payment Orders not disputed or vacated with a given Player as the
payor". There are no such Players; only Players responsible for
reporting Infractions.

That 1435/2 is - or will be - hey, did the Proposal pass or not, I'd
hate to have wasted so much energy if it in fact failed :) - seriously
broken is not the problem. The problem is that it is written, as are
the rest of the Rules, as if Blots were still Nomic Entities.

As for 1435/1, note that it says that Blots _are_ negative amounts
of Indulgences. Not that "'Blot' is short for '-1 Indulgences'".

Both of which are NEs.

Do you believe a VT is a Nomic Entity?  Do you believe 0.1 VT is
a Nomic Entity?  Why or why not?

I'm afraid I don't see the distinction between the two.  Could

That's the $64,000 question.  If there is nothing
else in the rules that can be taken as a
definition of a Blot, then the answer would have
to be yes.  If something else can define a Blot
(such as the Crime penalty rules - do they
implicitly define Blots?) then the answer would be
no - that statement would just define an alternate
way of talking about a kind of PO that just
happens to share the name Blot with a Nomic Entity
and to be related to that Nomic Entity in a
specific way.  I need to look at the Rules more
carefully before I can make up my mind which I
think is true.

I agree that a negative Indulgence is a Nomic Entity.  However,
disassociating the appelation of "Blot" from such Nomic Entities most
certainly does not cause these negative Indulgences to be destroyed;
they continue to exist as negative Indulgences.

Again, the same thing.  I doubt that even Morendil would have stated
that, had we repealed the Mil Rule separately from those creating
Marks, that doing so would destroy all exact multiples of the Mil.

Well, IMO Indulgences are a Nomic Entity, since they are a currency defined by
the Rules and having existence only via the rules.  So a negative Indulgence is
also a Nomic Entity, which makes a Blot a Nomic Entity (although admitedly just
an alternate name for "negative Indulgence").

Ah, good.  I really should re-read the proposal before opening my big mouth.

I take the present definition of a Blot as "an amount of -1
Indulgences" as a legislative synonym.  This, thus definition, and the
one that replaces it in P/C, are what are known as "rules of
construction" and thus do not create any entities in and of
themselves; they merely provide a shorthand for referring to entities
already existing.  There are a few other examples of such rules of
construction scattered throughout the Rules; for example, Rule 1023,
or the last paragraph of Rule 478.

I agree that this gets somewhat awkward.  But I am willing to let the
courts (and future proposals) sort out the details.

Probably true.  I was aiming for a minimum necessary change, and may
very well have come up short in that area.  I'm not too concerned
about that.

"X is Y" can have several meanings, including "X is a name for Y".
Common sense dictates that the most obvious interpretation be selected
over a less obvious one, even when the less obvious one is perhaps
more interesting.

I don't see what the relevance of the Nomic Entitiness of notational
conventions is.  Such conventions are basically unmanipulatable
anyway.

It's a reason, but it is not a sufficiently compelling reason, at

In both cases the Rules are quite clear that they do state what you term rules
of construction, or legal names for things that are outside the power of the
Rules to define or create. In the case of both amendments to 1435 under
discussion, however, the language involved is not one that supports your
theory; in particular, "A Blot is..." and "Player responsible for detecting
the change in Blots" in /1 and /2 respectively are extremely suggestive of,
and in fact IMHO actually implying, the Entityhood of Blots.

I disagree; I believe that the best interests or any Player, or set of Players,
are completely irrelevant, except accidentally, to the best interests of the
Game.

A Blot is no longer a distinct type of Entity. It is an instance of another
type of Entity -- a completely different thing. Um, in other words: an
instance of a Blot is an instance of a Nomic Entity, but the type "Blot" is
not a type of Nomic Entity, merely a name for a specific number of units of
a particular other type of Nomic Entity.

No Entity possesses a negative quantity of Irises, nor did any Entity do so
before the release of the results of Proposal 3531.

Nit: R1023 provides a shorthand way of specifying certain sorts of
timing requirements on actions, and this perhaps makes it a 'rule
of construction', but R1023 does not provide a shorthand way of
referring to entities already existing. Similar remarks apply to 
R478.

My point is different: if Morendil has good arguments, then it is my
view that the best interests of the majority would be served by respecting
those arguments, even if the consequences in the short term seem
unpalatable. Of course, I don't think his arguments are that good.

Well, let's hear your own counterarguments, then. Maybe you should start by 
picking a side in the Blots issue. :)

That is itself sufficient to make it a NE, IMHO. In fact, if "a Blot is an
instance of a type of Entity E", as you assert, we should be able to shorten
that to "a Blot is an E". We don't after all go around saying "I transfer one 
instance of the Entity type P-Note to Player X" do we ?

OK, let's go at this in a systematic fashion. We are debating whether a Blot
is an entity, in the generic sense, or not. An entity is, basically, something
that is. (The Latin root verb for the word is "to be".) So IMHO as long as
anything called X which in some way or another has any abstract or concrete
existence, we can point to that and say, "X is an entity". What matters as far 
as Rule 1586 is concerned is whether that entity owes its existence solely to 
the Rules, or not.

I think this assertion is mistaken, and I think the mistake arises
out of a confusion about abstraction. Basically, I believe that
because bits of information are in one sense more abstract than
plastic poker chips, some people have come to believe that the
entities they represent are abstract in a quite different - 
mathematical - sense. I believe this to be a mistake. Bits of
information are still physical and still governed by physical laws,
albeit by a different part of physical law than that which governs
the movements of poker chips.

I actually think that it is much *more* difficult to manipulate
virtual currencies in ways not provided for by the Rules. Plastic
poker chips are easy to steal: just wait until the Player is
distracted or goes to the bathroom or whatever and take one.
On the other hand, although it is possible to perform an analogous
feat for virtual currencies, it is quite difficult: you'd have to
hack a whole bunch of files containing the records of currency
holdings. I'm pretty certain that no-one has ever attempted this.
However, it's only R1011 that makes it illegal. Otherwise, R116 would
permit it.

The point is that what you can't do is steal virtual currencies
simply by posting to the Public Forum "I hereby steal 5 VTs from
Morendil." We used to explain this by saying that such an action
was permissible, but not possible. My recent thinking on the subject
leads me to qualify that explanation: actually, it *is* possible 
(because the records are encoded as physical bits of information
which it is perfectly possible to manipulate - illegally - according
to physical law), it's just not possible merely by posting to the
PF. Similarly, in a face-to-face game, you can't steal poker chips
by announcing to the room at large, "I hereby steal 5 VTs from
Morendil"; you actually have to take some physical action which
results in a change to the distribution of the physical tokens being
used to represent VTs. 

The fact that this maxim applies equally to face-to-face games as to
email-based games is my reason for claiming that, metaphysically,
there's no real difference between the two kinds of games. The
metaphysical question is: what is the relationship between the
entities defined or referred to by the rules of the game and the
physical tokens used to represent the distribution of those entities?
Answering that question gives essentially the same picture for
Monopoly as it does for Agora, or so I claim. In each case, the 
rules of the game define the ways in which the physical tokens may
be legally manipulated. In addition there will (almost certainly)
be further - illegal - ways in which it is physically possible to
manipulate those tokens. In each case, questions about the actual
state of the game will be answered by referring to the distribution
of the physical tokens. Where there is disagreement about the legality
of some change in the distribution of the physical tokens, players
will usually refer back to the most recent state of the game which 
they are prepared to accept as legal - regardless of how that state
was arrived at - and work from there. In neither case is it possible
to change the distribution of physical tokens by fiat: physical
action appropriate to the kind of physical token being used to
represent the game entity (stealing chips, hacking files) will have
to be taken to achieve that end. The legality of such manipulations
is, as ever, decided by the rules of the game.

Basically, my argument is that it makes no sense to regard the
references to 'Payment Orders', 'Transfer Orders' etc in the new
PC Rules as references to your newly minted Currencies. The new
PC Rules speak of the vacation, satisfaction, execution, and
cancellation of such orders. I can make no sense of what it might
mean to execute a unit of your newly minted Currency. This remains
true even in light of your interesting discoveries about Blots. To
the extent that we can make sense of 'executing a Blot', it is because
we have a Rule which defines a Blot to be a certain kind of Payment
Order. (The phrase still sounds awkward.) We have no Rules which
define your newly minted Currencies to be certain kinds of Payment
Order, however, and that seems to me to doom your scam.
