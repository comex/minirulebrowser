Well put--another example, which I just came up against, is that
I can quickly determine that Rule 376 (Proposals whose passage is
noted in a single message take effect in numerical order) takes
precedence over 1527 (Proposals whose passage is noted in a single
message take effect in the order their passage appears in the message).

I would also add that in the case of a single self-contradictory
Rule, a Rule is short enough that the last proposer to change it
probably looked over the entire Rule, and there is almost always one
"natural" interpretation to be preferred.  While some Rules may be
self-conflicting when read in an extremely literally way, hardly
any are when common sense is applied--we're very unlikely to
see a Rule which says, "Voting on a Proposal with a prime number
is a class C Crime.  Voting on a Proposal with a prime number
is not a Crime."  When different Rules conflict, however,
frequently neither interpretation is more natural than the other.

interpretation to be preferred

I note that the Chancellor is guilty of Persistent Indebtedness for this PO as
well.  I also note that, at this point, I have no idea who the Chancellor is. 
I think it may be Speaker Steve.  Is this true?

For now, I am only bringing this up on a-d, because I am not exactly
sure who is not doing eir job here, but someone is clearly failing to
fulfill ASAP requirements here, right? If the recordkeepors have
published the currency holdings of the above entities in probate (and
the above list seems to indicate that), and there are no open disputes
concerning any of the credits or debts of the entities in probate,
then the trustees have all commited the Infraction of Tardiness, a
Class D Crime which may be reported by any player (1023), because they
have not published and executed probate plans for quite some time now.

I am not sure whether my mentioning this on a-d already constitutes a
report of this Infraction in the sense of 1504; therefore I am also
not sure whether I am already obliged to issue the corresponding POs -
could someone let me know how such things were handled in the past?

Most people swim, ski or just hang out on vacation... I chose to write
an initial ruleset.  For those who are interested, you can see the
results of my spring break at:

   http://www.skidmore.edu/~jfry/astro.txt

I wrote it completely blind, having neither the original Suber set
nor the Agora rules before me.  Thus it has a nice home-brew flavor,
while maintaining some elements from Agora that I really like.

It also has about a million loopholes, but that's part of the fun.

The idea behind it was to try to form a Nomic that has a developing
storyline and setting (though only one rule, 020, actually defines
anything related to the world).  My concept was to have an environment
in which players regulate both their location (in this case, a space
station) but also eventually define the opposition, such as alien
invaders, hull breaches, civil wars, etc.  

I'm not sure if this will actually work, but I'd like to give it a try.
So, if you're in the mood for a low-traffic, fun sort of diversion,
let me know.  The Valkyrie will be officially setting sail, so to
speak, in a week or so.  I hope you can join the crew! :)

Correct, you have to transfer an Indulgence.  The thing you take care of
yesterday was the PO for a VT that needed to be satisfied.  It was the failure
to satisfy this on-time that caused the Blot reported in the Herald's report. 
Transfering that Indulgence will put this all to rest.

elJefe is currently Chancellor pro-tem. The Chancellorship has changed
hands a number of times of late: once on March 12 when G. Chaos delegated
it to elJefe, once on Mar 19 when the PoD concluded and I assumed the 
Office temporarily as Speaker, and again when I resigned the Office
appointing Jeff as my successor. Under the terms of R1585, each change
of Office resets the clock on all unfulfilled Official responsibilities
back to a week, so it's quite possible that no-one is guilty of PI.

Why haven't we fixed the bug which allows Players On Hold to be
guilty of Persistent Indebtedness? We need to tweak the definition
of PI so that it's defined in terms of failure to fulfil a certain
kind of responsibility (which being On Hold would obviously relieve
one of), instead of being defined as meeting a certain condition,
as it is at the moment.

I didn't propose any such thing. I completely agree that ordering is 
usually irrelevant. However, all the evidence I found in Game Custom 
deals with a later provision overruling an earlier provision, because 
that's how it's usually written. I'm sorry I mentioned ordering at 
all.

That's me, and that's not what I said. I say that when a rule 
conflicts with itself, and one of the conflicting provisions says 
that it modifies, limits, or clarifies the other provision or the 
entire rule, then that provision has precedence. For example, in "X 
is Y. The preceding shall have no effect on Z.", the second sentence 
takes precedence, but in "The following shall have no effect on Z. 
X is Y.", the first sentence takes precedence.
