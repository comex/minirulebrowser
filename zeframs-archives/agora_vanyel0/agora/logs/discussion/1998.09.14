I note that Proglet still has not appeared in your Reports. Also, the
figure of 7.9 VTs per Player in circulation is correct only if there are
15 Players, while there are currently 17 Players. Finally, it would
probably be a good idea to include in your report a quotation of the
current Voting Token Circulation Level, which I believe stands at the
moment at 9, but which of course is subject to change by your good self,
in accordance with R1852:

Rule 1852/0 (Power=1)
Circulation of Voting Tokens

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

Thank you for not dinging me.

Steve, a particularly astute and experienced Player if ever there was
one, has demonstrably been in a state of confusion about the number of
VTs he owns.  If an experienced Player can be so much in the dark, I
think it's a bit rich to expect me to have kept accurate track of all
the VTs the Bank owns.  In fact, there is an Officer who is supposed
to do this for us.  But that same Officer hasn't produced a report for
six weeks!

I had enough work on my plate without being simultaneously required to
track all the POs and TOs made involving the Bank as payor, a job
supposed to be done by the Accountor.

This is true.  However, given that very few payment orders were being
satisfied, it surely doesn't matter if they are all a little late.
They'll all eventually get discharged, and people will get what's
coming to them.

By failing as Accountor, you effectively required me to do the bulk of
your job for you.  (Most POs and TOs are to and from the Bank.)  It is
true that this is required by the ruleset, but that doesn't make it
any more palatable.  (You are not the only showing restraint
incidentally.  I could be removing you from Office now for Dereliction
of Duty, and issuing you with a PO for 10 Indulgences and 10 VTs.)

I'm sorely tempted to resign as Chancellor; people urging you to
"ding" me, and then being satisfied with a scolding but without
identifying themselves to me directly or publically seems a bit
underhand and nasty.  However, resigning as Chancellor would just drop
a pile of work onto Murphy's shoulders (now that the post is held
temporarily, resigning automatically removes me directly from Office).

Bemused by vitriol,
Michael.

Heh.  It actually _is_ mentioned in the Spring Cleaning Proto.

A PhD and a large increase in the real cost of passing Proposals... plus a
solid dose of procrastination.  My mailbox currently contains 1257
messages that I have not disposed of, since March...

I will try to go through it and remove those corrections that are not
applicable any longer.  I don't think I am going to look through all new
changes, that'll have to be a matter for next February.  Whether I will
have the time then I can't say.

Greetings,

Hi all,

I just submitted a proposal that would eliminate Thring from the list
of voting members of IN, becasue Thring's last liaison recently
reported tht Thring is defunct.

It has now been distributed officially, so you all have one week to
vote on it (and I hope that this time we make quorum and can vote for
this - I admit it's not a big deal, but at least getting it adopted
will give us two IN score points).

Here goes:

>>>>
INP 383

submitted by Agora:

>>
Amend Rule 215 by removing the string "Thring,".
<<

---------------------------------

The submitter added the following comments:

Let me add that this was suggested by the last Thring liaison emself
in a recent mail:
>>

as (former?) liaison for Thring I thought I would mention that it is
pretty much dead and there would be little objection from its removal from
the list of voting members. Also, if someone would enlighten me on how to
unsubscribe this list it would be much appreciated.

Note that some players kept their accounts in good order the entire
time, promptly paying all debts.  I really appreciate that.  Agorans
should take them as shining examples.

True, but Please! I have not been that officer for  6 weeks.   If you
had just stuck to basics you could have paid the PO's you issued with
the Bank as Payor with very little extra effort or worry.  You just
needed to take the last known figures keep track and make TO's for the
PO's you yourself have made that name the Bank as Payor.  That would
take care of the  bulk of them, as i point out below. Even disregarding
the TO's naming you as Payee, and  just keeping track of your outgoing
VT's would have kept the Bank at least from most trouble.

>I had enough work on my plate without being simultaneously required to

All Players should keep track of their own accounts. After all,
Accountors can make errors and your duties to pay PO's continue no
matter what the state of the Accountor's office.  I hate to drag real
life into Agora, but in effect what you, and apparently everyone else,
is doing is like taking the Bank's word about the status of your
account without keeping a checkbook ledger up to date.  As someone who
has worked in Banking (don't worry I was not in charge of any
accounting:) I know exactly how foolish that is.

It might have affected whether a Player voted or not.  That is a matter
at the heart of Agora!

Hardly, I am to  keep detailed records. For many reasons,  it is
important to have one independent, official tally of all VT accounts
kept by an officer, but I think that each Player should also keep track
of eir own accounts.  Why else do the rules penalize Players and
Executors for not paying their debts in a timely fashion based on PO
issuance and not the date of the last Accountor's Report? Expecting you
to keep track of the basic state of your and the Bank's account is not
asking you to do my job for me, it is asking you to do yours.  

>(You are not the only showing restraint

As was discussed before.  So whose penalties would be worse you think,
yours or mine?
<Deletia>
>I'm sorely tempted to resign as Chancellor;

>Bemused by vitriol,

You think i have not been tempted to resign as Accountor?  I have
gained no VT's by doing this Office, however badly.  But no one seems
to want the job, so I will continue.  I hope soon I will be able to
consistently produce prompt and ratifiable reports.  I hope that you
will be able to rely on the report as you have in the past, even if you
shouldn't.

I am just a wee bit confused by this line in the report still.  I want
to clear up all misunderstandings before they bite me.  Does this line
mean that I started being Accountor on August 30 1998 and my term of
service will end on January 12 1998?  If so  why? Can you tell me when
I actually became the Accountor?  My records show i accepted Blob's
appointment in the Public Forum on August 19, 1998.

Thank you !
I wish America would change once and for all to dates that make sense. 
I got used to the DD-MM-YY when I lived in Germany, but now I am out of
practice.

Just wait until the beginning of the next century!  Can you imagine trying
to guess what date 01-02-02 means?

Greetings,

 Indeed!  Part of the reason i had used long dates in my first report
was to avoid confusion and gain Y2K compliance.  Oh well.  I still
don't have the formatting automated.

You may have done it already and I haven't got down to it in my backlog of
messages yet, but some of us also already paid the Blots, which should be
returned to us, as well.

One of my long-standing projects has always been ruleset
restructuring; our current ruleset is a sordid mess in many ways.
Attached is a preliminary draft of a constitution, which would take
the place of the entire Ruleset and fill the legislative purpose of
the current Power=3 Rules.  The remainder of the Rules would be
enacted as "subordinate" ordinary legislation by the same Proposal
which enacted the constitution.  (The mechanics of actually enacting
the constitution will be complex, as well, but, I think, quite
doable.)

I would also like to bring back the equivalency between Rules and
Adopted Proposals, but that will come later. :)

======================================================================

PREAMBLE.

We, the Players of Agora Nomic, do hereby establish and ordain this
Constitution as the supreme law of this Nomic.

ARTICLE I.  THE LAW.

The law of this Nomic shall be:
  1) this Constitution, and all properly enacted amendments thereto;
  2) all Rules enacted by the Assembly of Players under this
     Constitution, to the extent that such Rules do not conflict with
     this Constitution; and
  3) any other regulations enacted under the authority of the Rules of
     the Assembly, to the extent that such regulations do not conflict
     with the Rules or the Constitution.

The law in force at a given time governs at that time.  The amendment 
or repeal of any part of the law does not extinguish or otherwise
affect any liability, duty, or proceeding which arose under a
preceding form of the law, unless the act which effected the amendment
or repeal explicity requires it.

The law of this Nomic shall have jurisdiction over each person who has
consented, either actually or constructively, to its jurisdiction, and
shall be binding upon such persons at all times during which such
consent is effective.  A person may withdraw such consent at any time
by communicating it to any officer designated by the Rules to receive
such communications, or in the absence of such a designation, by
publically announcing it in a way such that all Players are reasonably
likely to see it.

No act not explicitly prohibited by the law shall be subject to
penalty under the law.

ARTICLE II. THE ASSEMBLY OF PLAYERS.

(not yet written)

ARTICLE III. AMENDMENT; SAVINGS CLAUSE.

Any act which would seek to amend this Constitution must have the
express consent of three-quarters of the members of the Assembly of
Players.  No amendment to this Constitution shall occur except as
given above.

This Constitution, and all Rules established under it, may be set aside
entirely by the unanimous, express, and public consent of all members
of the Assembly of Players.  No rule or lesser regulation may act to
prohibit or interfere with this process.  Consent, for the purpose of
this section, is valid for fourteen (14) days after it is publically
expresssed.  The Speaker shall have the authority to adjudicate
disputes arising relative to this section.

What do you mean, "no longer fitting"? It's spring in Australia, the

As Ørjan points out, your Term of Service will end on Dec. 1. Likewise,
although you became Accountor when you accepted Blob's appointment, your
current Term of Service did not begin until you won the Accountor
Election, at (according to the Report), 30 Aug 1998 17:28:37 GMT. I do
think Michael could use a more readable date format.

Spring?  In Australia?  Nope, you only have summer there.  When I visited
Sydney in July 1988, the first thing we did was go to the beach.  It's not
every July we can do that at home...

But you do not need to know the exact state of VTs in order to do your
job. What you are being criticised for is failing to satisfy Salary POs
which you issued. All you needed to do in order to satisfy them was to
make sure the Bank had enough funds to cover any transfers you might
make. The simplest - although by no means the only - way to do this
would have been to mint enough VTs to cover those transactions. The
Chancellor has the power to do this.

My gut reaction to this is negative, perhaps other Players will have
more of a stomach for this though. This is not a criticism of how you
are proposing to do this, but of what you are proposing to do.  I like
the spirit--and most of the text so far--of the Spring cleaning protos
much better.

My heart dropped when you first mentioned your owning a negative number
problem with this report.   I have fixed that.  Fortunately it was
caused by improperly deleting failed TO's from my calculations page.  I
was able to quickly remedy it.

I appreciate the comments I have quoted above.  I will fix the problems
when i reissue the report.  

I am planning to increase the VTC level as soon as i issue my current
and revised reports

Further COEs on the Registrar's Report:

* As the leader of the recent Revolt, I should have the Patent Title
  "Robespierre".

* There are no Nominees for Promotor listed. I believe I have already
  Nominated for this Election. If not, then I do so. I also Nominate
  for the Election of Assessor.

My response upon seeing the onset of the situation was to counsel that
we change our attitude toward them to Friendly, since that would be
the response that made the least sense.

Personally, I wouldn't mind seeing it raised but I do object to it being

I'm very much interested to see more on this...  As you may know, I have
been an advocate of a constitutional system for quite some time.  As I see
it there is much to be gained from such a system if it's done well.
Besides, I have begun to think it might be time for a major rewrite of the
rules.  Right now it's very much a tangled mess in more than a few places.
It's like a small house that's expanded over the years by adding room after
room.  Pretty soon it becomes a maze.
