I sent the SLR out over 24 hours ago, but I haven't seen it come
back yet.  It's probably just stuck in the mail somewhere, but
I'm going to send it out again anyway.  Apologies if it
shows up twice.

I shall requote General Chaos:

 Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
  VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.

  The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank *DOES* satisfy VT1040 and VT1041, since both
are for the amount of 2 VTs.  (had 4 VTs actually been transferred, which
they weren't, since no VTs existed)

To say that "Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank *DOES* satisfy VT1040 and
VT104" is either too vague or simply false. 'Transferring 4 VTs to
the Bank' does not name a specific act, but rather a kind of act: to
get to a specific act, we have to know who's doing the transferring,
and when. If I were to post to the Public Forum stating that a
certain kind of act, in my opinion, would or would not be effective ,
and you disagreed with me, your correct course of action is not to
make a COE, but a CFJ. For my stating that a certain kind of act is
illegal does not represent the game state particularly as being one
way rather than another, in the sense that Official Reports represent
the game state as being one way rather than another.

But Claims of Error concern reportings on the actual game state, not
on hypothetical game states. See R1431. No one, with the possible
exception of General Chaos himself, doubts that his interpretation of
the Rules concerning Payment Orders was mistaken. But his interpretation 
of the Rules cound not the subject of a Claim of Error; only his
claim that this particular Transfer Order (or Orders) did not satisfy
these particular Payment Orders could be the subject of a COE.

Not true. Being deregistered is an event, not a state. Officers are
removed from Office if they are deregistered, ie if deregistration happens
to them. Deregistration has not happened to Morendil since he became
Speaker-Elect, so he remains Speaker-Elect despite not being a Player.

However, if a Revolt occurs before the end of October and Morendil
becomes Speaker, which is not impossible, then (i) he will once again
be a Player courtesy of R103, and (ii) he will immediately be hit
with a whole bunch of Blots courtesy of R1437, arising from the
Fugitive Blots which are being held for him until his return, and
these will have the effect of making him Lawless once again, and
hence deregisterable once again on the whim of any Player. Of course,
by that point, he won't be holding any Offices to be removed from anyway.

Finally, if a Revolt occurs *after* then end of October, the situation
is less clear. Fugitive Blots are halved at the beginning of each month,
so whether Morendil would be Lawless upon his resuming being a Player
would depend on precisely how many Blots he had when he deregistered,
and this is not clear. Furthermore, it's a close run thing, since many
of the proposed countings of the Blots are hovering just under or just
over the critical 60 Blot figure. On the other hand, it's pretty likely
that Morendil would be unable to meet his Indulgence obligations to
the Bank, and so would soon be receiving more Blots for Persistent
Indebtedness.  Unless of course he gets included in whatever amnesty
we decide to pass, if any.

As you can see, the situation is quite subtle and complicated.

I'm not at all sure that this is any more effective. To understand
the source of my doubts, we need to look at why your first proto at
AI=1 could not be effective in amending R1672. This is not - quite -
as simple as pointing out that R1672 forbids its own amendment. You
also have to notice that R594, the Rule which gives provisions in
Proposals their power to effect changes to the Rules, states that
provisions shall be implemented to the maximum extent permitted by
the Rules. Since R1672 does not permit itself to be amended, your
first proto cannot amend it.

But then, by precisely the same reasoning, neither can your second.
The AI and Power of your Proposal played no role in the argument given
above. If your Proposal were to be adopted at AI=1.1, R1672 would still
forbid its own amendment, and Rule 594 would still go along the ban,
making the amendment ineffective. The reason is that no Proposal can
be more effective than R594 says it is, no matter what its AI is, and
R594 goes along with R1672 every time in forbidding the amendment of
R1672 - by Proposal.

If you want to tinker with R1672, then you're going to have to create
a *Rule* with Power > 1, which has amongst its effects the amendment of
R1672. That will conflict with R1672, of course, but it'll win the conflict
in virtue of its higher Power.

R1672 doesn't forbid its own amendment, period - it only forbids
amendments that would change the restrictions it places on the Frankenstein
Rule.  My second proto first repeals the forbidding clause (which change is
not prohibited by the forbidding clause), then tinkers with the FG's
restrictions.

I agree that that would definitely work.

Not so trivial as you think. The beginning of the Nomic Week is the 
last moment of the preceding Sunday, as well as the first moment of 
the relevant Monday.

Neither.  Unix uses 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z as the epoch, and we are at
around 870 million seconds since then (yes, I am fairly aware of the
passing of seconds since 1970).  The number above is greater than that.

PROTO-PROPOSAL: The Fork (v1.1)

favor's old idea, updated to use Applications (which seem a particularly
appropriate mechanism for this).

v1.1: Added specifications of Parent Nomic and Incept Date.  Reworded more
gramatically.  Came up with a more flexible form of PF sharing.

###

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "The Fork",
reading

      The Fork Depth of Agora is 0.  The Parent Nomic of Agora is Nomic
      World.  The Incept Date of Agora is 29th June 1993, 12:04:30 UTC.

      There is a type of Application known as an Application to Fork,
      the purpose of which is to create a new nomic.  Such an Application
      is Executed by posting it to the Public Forum stating that one is
      doing so.  For an Application to Fork to take effect, when Executed:

      * it must state that it is an Application to Fork;

      * it must clearly identify a name for the nomic to be created,
        which cannot be "Agora";

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When an Application to Fork takes effect, a new nomic is created.
      The new nomic's game state, including all game history, is an
      exact duplicate of Agora's game state at that time, except that
      the following changes are applied in sequence:

      * Players whose signatures the Application does not bear cease to
        be Players.

      * All instances of the characters "Agora", including quoted
        instances, in the text of the Rules, are changed by replacing
        "Agora" with the name of the new nomic.

      * The first paragraph of this Rule is changed to read "The Fork
        Depth of <name> is <depth>.  The Parent Nomic of <name> is Agora.
        The Incept Date of <name> is <date>.", in which "<name>" is the
        name of the new nomic, "<depth>" is 1 greater than the Fork
        Depth of Agora, and "<date>" is the time of the Application
        taking effect, in the same form as the date at the end of the
        first paragraph of this Rule.

      * All Public Fora become Shared.

      * Any other changes clearly specified in the Application.

      * The effects of the Application, rather than to create a new nomic,
        were to make all the above changes to the game state.

Be it further resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Sharing the
Public Forum", reading

      Each medium designated as a Public Forum is either Shared or
      Unshared.  When the Registrar makes a medium a Public Forum,
      e may specify whether it is Shared or Unshared; if e does not,
      it is Unshared.  The Registrar is authorised to change a Public
      Forum between being Shared and Unshared, Without Objection.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, a message in a Shared
      Public Forum is thereby in the Public Forum only if it states
      clearly that it pertains to Agora.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, any message in a Public
      Forum is thereby in the Public Forum only if it does not state
      clearly that it does not pertain to Agora.

{The idea here is that any forked nomic could have its own dedicated
(Unshared) PF, and might itself have child nomics that share that PF
(it is for them Shared).  Messages to a PF by default pertain only to
the nomic for which that PF is Unshared.  With backup PFs, a nomic might
well have a mixture of Shared and Unshared PFs.}

Be it further resolved that all current Public Fora are Unshared.

Not quite.  Because R594 has the ridiculously low Power of 1 itself,
one need only override its provisions in one's proposal (by amending
it say), having one's way with the F. Rule and then reinstating R594
(or not).  One need not create a fresh rule..

I also think that R1322 should say 
  "A given Rule Change takes effect iff the Power of the
   instrument..."

where I have replaced "unless" with "iff".  This would achieve the
desired end because R1322 takes precedence over the Frankenstein Rule,
and would allow the change to take place.

No, there isn't. It's just a long message because it has four Judgements
and three pieces of Evidence, some of them rather long.

This is how it should be, and this is how I judged it. Don't make it
seem as if I regarded otherwise. In my opinion, General Chaos's message,
on which Morendil COE'ed, stated that transferring 4 VTs to the Bank
would not satisfy the Payment Orders. This was in Error, but General
Chaos, by denying Morendil's COE, denied that this was.

I thought I made that allegation...

I am of course more worried about the older parts. I understand that
despite using informal archives as sources, the Archivist has not been
able to reconstruct all of our CFJs, for example.

Well, the Frankenstein Monster has been known to be a Player.

"Whenever an entity without an Executor is the owner of Currency, that
Entity is placed into Probate if it is not already so."  Plus a few other

The creation of the Rule itself would be prohibited by Rule 1698, and by
your own argument a Proposal cannot take Precedence over a Rule. You would
need something that allowed the final Rule Change to be within a Rule,
like:

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule be created with Power 3.1, reading

      Immediately after this Rule is created, it shall be amended to read
      "Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no such thing as a
      Currency, a Payment Order, a Transfer Order, or a unit of Currency,
      exists."

No it isn't. (Come on, zefram. You're a programmer.)

All right, you asked for it.  A (possibly apocryphal) story related to
me by a graduate student who had come from a large midwest
(Wisconsin?) univ.  Seems that one of his classes was taught by the
department emeritus Prof who was very old (in his 80's) and sometimes
a bit vague, but at other times incredibly sharp.  One day in lecture
he was explaining something abstruse and paused to look at the board
for a moment.  Thereupon he wrote down a result and said, eyes
twinkling, "And this is intuitively obvious..".  Whereupon he smiled,
looked out over the class, saw the rows of blank stares, and turned
back to the board to contemplate the statement written there.  This
went on for about a minute, at the end of which time he started to
wander, rather deeply in thought, across the stage.  This went on for
a minute or two, after which the Prof. drifted out into the hall and
was heard walking back and forth.  People started to, well, look at
each other and smile.  A scout was sent out who reported the old boy
was pacing around and muttering to himself.  The class, incredibly,
remained reasonably calm.

About five minutes after the scout had returned, there was a happy
shout from the hallway, and the again bright-eyed Prof. scuttled back
in, pointed to the intuitively obvious result written on the
blackboard, turned to the class and said, all aglow,
        "Yes, yes, it IS intuitively obvious".

The Judge's opinion is that the events at the End of a Nomic Week occur
infinitesimally before the events at the Beginning of the following Week,
with the date changing in between.

Greetings,

I don't think that any part of the week Sep 8 - Sep 15 is temporally
located on Sep 7. The last moment of Sunday, Sep 7 is simply the end
of the preceding week.

Well, I'd kind of gotten the impression that there were some things
you weren't inclined to agree with me about, like whether the Registrar
should have to make an announcement if the deregistration does not occur,
and the 8 weeks/2 months issue. So it seemed simplest just to go ahead
and propose the version I wanted to see, and acknowledge your contribution,
which is substantial.

How do you like 'Silent'?

Why not express this date as 30th June, 1993 00:04:30 +1200, the same
way it appears in the Happy Birthday Rule?

I think this is a little too easy. I'm happy for it to be less than a
majority. How about a third of all Active Senators? That'd be four or
five (maybe six) at the moment.

Otherwise, as I've said, I like it. I can imagine it being used to
explore counterfactuals: what would have happened if Proposal 7777
had passed instead of failing? Let's find out! (Of course, it wouldn't
really be an accurate test).

I wasn't referring to the technical details. I meant: what would it 
mean for, say Rule 101 to be in Probate? How can we make sense of
that?

To the extent we can make sense of it, the effects are weird. R1601
staes that entities in Probate cannot be destroyed. Would that mean
that a Rule which possessed Currency couldn't be repealed? Or that
a Location which possessed Currency could not be destroyed by amending
the relevant Rules, unless they took precedence of R1601?

What does it mean to be able to submit Transfer orders on behalf of
a Location, a Rule or a Kudo? What does it mean to be able to act on
behalf of such entities as if you were that entity? How can I act as
if I were Rule 101? It's a category mistake, a conceptual error, like,
as Douglas Adams says, the Suez canal popping out for a bun.

Right. Good point. Note that I don't argue precisely that a Proposal
cannot take precedence over a Rule, although that's a tempting way of
putting it. I'd say rather that Proposals are not the kind of entities
that can partake in precedence relations. Proposals cannot conflict
with Rules, and can neither win nor lose such conflicts. Only Rules
can do that.

'would not' is hypothetical; COEs concern actual, not hypothetical,
states of affairs. The only assertion that General Chaos made that
could properly have been the subject of a Claim of Error was his
assertion that *these particular* Transfer Orders failed to satisfy
*these particular* Payment Orders - which assertion was correct. Any
further assertions that General Chaos made to the effect that similarly
worded Transfer Orders made in different circumstances, viz, ones in
which Harlequin had 4 VTs, would still not have satisfied the Payment
Orders are, while false, concerned with merely hypothetical states of
affairs and therefore not the proper subject of a COE. They are therefore
irrelevant.

I strongly disagree with this. I do not agree that "deregistered"
in the context of R1555 is a continuous state, but rather a 
specific event, and that, even if it is, it has no effect of
kicking Morendil out of the Office. Why? Well, R1555 mentions what 
happens if "A Player is Deregistered." Obviously, if deregistered 
is the state of not being registered, a Player cannot be 
deregistered, and since Morendil is not a Player anyway, it has
no effect on him. If it refers to an event, it has no relevance
here because Morendil was deregistered before the Election ended.
Therefore, either way Morendil is still Speaker-Elect.

The current version prevents amendments which were in the past in the
Rule but which no longer are. For example, the "There is an Office of
Frankenstein Monster" provision. The suggested amendment makes these
legal.

True, and nicely spotted. Because R594 is maximally co-operative with
other Rules and therefore never comes into conflict with them, it
does not require high Power to work properly. It might, however, be a
good idea to upmutate it a little (Power 2, I'd say; making it Power
3 would make me nervous, since I'm not convinced we'll never need to
make a controversial amendment to this Rule again), to protect it from
this kind of tampering.

And, crucially, 'shall not take' with 'takes'.

That it would, but it has other effects we need to think about
carefully, eg it brings R1322 into conflict with R594 over the
effectiveness of some Rule Changes. Your change would make having
high enough Power a sufficient condition for a Rule Change's
(Proposal's) being effective, any Rule with lower precedence than
R1322 to the contrary notwithstanding, whereas currently R594 adds
the further condition that no other Rule forbids the change. Thinking
about it a bit, though, that might not be such a bad thing.
