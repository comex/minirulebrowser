Agreed.

Also agreed.  Would you like to propose a fix?

Actually, I don't see anything in the InterNomic ruleset that actually
restricts the right to propose or submit SFJs to members of InterNomic,
so I am attempting to submit a proposal and SFJ in my own name to test
that theory.

What is a "charter nomic" that makes it different from other nomics?

A "charter nomic" is a nomic created by the power of another nomic,
rather than spontaneously arising from the writhing nomic masses.
The concept is interesting as an exercise of sovereign power, and for
the potential for the chartered nomic to eventually acquire its own
sovereignty.

Of course not.  However, please note that as a consequence, certain
Proposals we believed not to have been adopted back in July and August
were in fact adopted in July and August as originally reported.  The
error cascade may be quite large.

The affected Proposals are 3537 and 3538 (adopted July 24) and 3543
(adopted August 17).  They are reproduced below.  Since these
Proposals were originally reported by the Assessor as having been
adopted, they were adopted as of the date of those reports, even
though in the interim we had incorrectly ascertained that they had not
been adopted.  I do hope that Promotor and Herald Crito has not
discarded any of his records of P-Note and Indulgence transfers for
the past six months. :)

This report is, of course, not yet official, and is mainly provided to
give the Rulekeepor a chance to begin his investigations.  A full and
official report on all Proposals from 3534 on will be published soon.

======================================================================

Proposal 3537 (Steve)
Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1623 be amended by deleting from it
the text:

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3538 (Steve)
Restore Game Balance II

[Comment: with the Judgement of CFJ 928, and the reversal of the
transfers which occurred subsequent to the passage of P3482, we
have returned to the absurdly VT-abundant environment (there are
now over 7700 VTs in circulation) which that Proposal sought,
unsuccessfully as it turned out, to correct. This time, I'm taking
no chances; I'm making RGBII enact a self-repealing Rule.]

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Restore Game Balance II",
be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the following changes to Nomic
      Properties take place:

      (1) the number of Voting Tokens in the Bank is increased by
          the total number of Voting Tokens possessed by all Contests,
          and the number of Voting Tokens held by each Contest is
          adjusted to zero;

      (2) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Player who
          possesses more than 200 Voting Tokens is adjusted to be
          200, and to each decrease in the Voting Tokens possessed
          by these Players caused by this adjustment there corresponds 
          an equivalent increase in the number of Voting Tokens held
          by the Bank;

      (3) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Entity other
          than the Bank is adjusted to be one tenth of its previous
          value, and to each such decrease caused by this adjustment
          there corresponds an equivalent increase in the number of
          Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by any Player 
          after the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5,
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by that Player is
          adjusted to be 5, and to each such increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      All adjustments required by this Rule are detected and reported by
      the Assessor. This Rule shall repeal itself when the adjustments
      required by it are reported by the Assessor in the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3543 (Harlequin) (Disinterested) AI = 1
Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies

Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Amend Rule 1712  ("Distribution of Indulgences") to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players: for each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birthday."

Still, it would not be the first time this happened. The Fantasy Rules

I think it is also not enough if you are just any old FM of the SLc of

If I can pharse a good one, then yet. I think Thring's proposal is
overkill, and will exclude at least one nomic from the existing list.

R212 is somewhat ambigous about this. The first statement says that  any
nomic may submit a CFJ, the second refers explicitly to 'the member who
submitted it' but this is already a part of the judge selection process.
I've seen your post to Internomic already, and I thisnk that your proposal
is invalid, since it doesn't contain a rule change.

The Virus does not 'do damage', not at least in any permanent way. It
knocks roughly two Rules out every three weeks, for a period of two
weeks. It has demonstrated again and again its ability to produce
interesting and novel situations. If we repeal it we'll be depriving
ourselves of all the fun and interest it can yet provide us with.

I think it's completely specious to suggest any connection between
the Virus and the Plots proto. If the authors of the Plots proto
are 'waiting for things to settle down' before proposing it, what
has the Virus to do with that? By far most of the turbulence, such
as it is, that we've seen in the last few months has had nothing
whatever to do with Virus, but rather has been connected to problems
with Probate and Executors in Probate, the destruction of Currencies,
having a non-Player Speaker-Elect and then a non-Registered Speaker,
and so on. Admittedly the infection of R1598 has, indirectly, by
causing us to examine more closely than we had previously the wordings
of Rules 1442, 206, 683 and 955, thereby caused us to reappraise the
results of the last 90-odd Proposals, a serious situation with which
we haven't yet really begun to deal. But I'd say it's entirely to
the credit of the Virus that it has brought this situation to our
attention. As a result, we now have a much clearer understanding of
how the voting Rules are currently working. It would be wrong,
however, to blame the Virus for the serious situation it has caused
us to discover. Rather, we should take this as amply illustrating the
Virus' other useful function, that of spotlighting neglected corners
of the Ruleset.  

Don't Repeal the Virus. Vote AGAINST Proposal 3638!

H. Notary Murphy!

The final provision of Rule 1671 requires you to maintain a list
of the name, Class, Administrator and Executor of each Frankenstein
Monster. Since other provisions in R1671 appear to make it the case
the only Frankenstein Monsters can vote on Proposals, it would be
useful if you could post a list of all the current Frankenstein
Monsters, so we can tell who's eligible to vote.

Hm. Did that huge corrected Assessor's Report take these FM facts into
account? I don't think so. Uh oh.

Sorry. I see that such a list was included in the last Notary's Report.
Thanks, Murphy.

Most of that Report will be fine, actually. The restriction of voting
to Frankenstein Monsters only appeared in R1671 about two weeks ago,
just before the infection of R1598, IIRC.

If you need the text of any of the adopted Proposals in the rage 3555
through 3599, let me know.  I have them, just didn't include them
because there were no changes; however, it's possible (in fact,
likely) that there were conflicting amendments, since some of those
Proposals were reproposes, at least in part, of Proposals which were
previously thought to have failed.

That would only affect Proposal 1601 through current, and not even all
of them since most of the votes on the last batch were cast before the
FM provision regarding voting took effect.

What a pain in the ass. I owe a P-note to the bank (what the heck for, 
anyway?) and can't pay it off because I don't have any P-notes, and
can't expect to get any until I make a Proposal. 

Uh, no personal offense intended, Crito. :)

Nice try, Harlequin, but you neglected to notice that an Insane
proposal has to be Interested - ie you have to pay the petition fee.
Sadly, even if you tried to, you cannot do this, because a) you don't
have any P-Notes, and b) Transfer Orders don't work.

I thought of this one too. I haven't done it for the same reasons. 

Everyone else out there can amuse themselves by working out what the scam
we are referring to is. :)
