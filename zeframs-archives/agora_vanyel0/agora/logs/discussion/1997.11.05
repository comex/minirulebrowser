Somewhat to my surprise, Swann, I find that I like this! I've only
read about the first two-thirds of it, but so far it seems admirably
clear and an improvement on the current system. Can you offer an 
analysis of this will affect the ruleset in terms of total length in
lines and in number of Rules?

My general feeling is that we will probably end up having to to develop
some kind of tort law to allow Players to seek compensation for damages.

Aaah. The source of our disagreement is revealed. Your idea of a
requirement is something which, if it is not met, results in the
violation of a Rule. Whereas I've been using a broader notion of
a requirement as something which it is necessary to meet in order to
achieve some purpose.

Whose notion is more appropriate? I really can't say...

I think that is more properly called a "duty" (or "obligation").
"Requirement", IMO, is a much broader term, covering not only those
conditions which are necessary to avoid sanctions, but also those
conditions which are necessary to invoke public powers.

I tend to think yours is.

I must necessarily disagree with Chuck, as well; if a Rule required
that prospective Players deposit $20 in Agora's bank account before
registering, I would hold that any registration attempt by a
prospective Player who had not yet done so is without effect.

I don't think Chuck would have any disagreement with you on that
score. He would simply claim that, as he understands the word
'requirement', no requirement has been imposed on the non-Player
to make any deposit.

Chuck has, to the best of my understanding, argued that if the
hypothetical Rule was worded "A person who wishes to register must
first deposit $20 in Agora's bank account", it would nonetheless fail
to prevent a registration without deposit because, in Chuck's opinion
as I understand it, the Rules lack the power to impose any duty to
perform an action upon non-Players.  Since the prospective registree
is not bound by the Rules, eir failure to perform the duty required is
not a violation of the Rules.  I must necessarily dissent from this
opinion, on the grounds that the hypothetical Rule does not impose a
duty; rather, it establishes a rule for recognizing valid attempts to

I am of the opinion that there is an insufficient causal relationship
between your agency as the author of the described program and the
possible effects of the various statements that program would
generate for us to assume that, e.g., its printing at some point of
its execution the string "I hereby register as a Player" is a
manifestation of your intention to register as a Player.

In other words, I don't believe your message can be considered 
equivalent to a message containing every possible string made up of 
the letters of the alphabet plus some punctuation.

Also, I note that your program does not terminate. This is easily
provable. Thus the program produces no definite output. ;)

Lieber David,

leider spreche ich kein C, und kann daher nicht beurteilen, was Dein
Programm eigentlich macht.

Ich dachte bisher, die offizielle Sprache von Agora sei Englisch,
konnte aber keinen Hinweis darauf in den Regeln finden. Daher antworte
ich auf Deutsch und hoffe, Du kannst meine Nachfrage verstehen und
auch eine Art Uebersetzung Deines Programms (ins Englische oder
Deutsche) veroeffentlichen. Ansonsten werde ich, was meine Aufgaben
als Botschafter/Ambassador angeht, Deine Mail einfach ignorieren.

Sorry fuer meine Ignoranz - meine Monte-Carlo-Simulationen mache ich
alle in Fortran.

Herzlichen Gruss, Kolja A.

That is a similar problem to the one we had recently with an
assignment to the Apellate Court of a player who had not been
registered yet when the original CFJ had been made. There the
eligibility rules were not completely clear about the time at which
the eligibility condition had to be fulfilled. CFJ 1046 decided this
timing question.

Maybe a similar CFJ would be appropriate for the current situation.

My German is pretty patchy, but I think I should point point out that
we did have a CFJ in French a while ago, one that asserted in effect
that English is *not* Agora's official language and that Agora does
not have an official language as such. Although it certainly does have
a lingua franca, you should pardon the expression, and the pun.

As it happens, I don't speak much C either, but it was still pretty
clear to me what David's program was intended to do, although if it 
contains a minor bug (so that, say, its actual output is very different
from what KoJen intended it to be), I certainly won't be the first to
find it. I must say that I suspect that anyone who has written a
Monte Carlo simulation program, albeit in Fortran (do I gather
correctly from the above that this is what you have done?), knows
enough about computer languages to figure out what KoJen's program
does.

This is not to say that I think KoJen's post has any effect in
particular, say, that of registering him, or of making two Kudo
transfers, one from Andre to Calabresi, and one from Calabresi
to ChrisM (the first two legal Kudo transfers in lexical order
that KoJen can make, assuming he's registered, and note that
'register' is lexically prior to 'transfer'). But I don't think the
reason for this can be simply that his post was a C program.

Dear Swann,

What is your prediction for the continuing existence of VTs and other
items through the transition caused by the adoption of your objects
proto? How do we know there will not be another wholesale destruction
of items vital for playing, like there was after the PC reform?

This is not a criticism, but a real request for information and your
opinion. 

Kolja A.

Once you have determined all Currency holdings of the estate and determined
that no PO is in dispute, probate code allows you to simply vacate all POs that
cannot be satisfied.

I should like to point out that KoJen's post makes
no reference to where the output of the program
will be directed and the program makes no specific
reference either (other than to standard output). 
There is no reason to believe that such output
would be directed to the PF.

On the contrary. It is simply a mathematical way of stating what has been a
frequent concept in Agora: a number of actions, occurring simultaneously,
nevertheless in a particular order.

It doesn't matter how it's run. For any way of running it, it produces the
same output.

It is possible for it to run forever. We simply add memory as it fills up. As
the sun gets old, we move it to a new star. As the universe gets old, we
simply move it to another universe.

Besides, a program is an abstract mathematical entity. One doesn't need
physical hardware to know what a program's output is.

Surely. But in this case it can definitely be determined what X is, in a
reasonably short time after Y.

So what? Whyever would I want to use a Turing Machine? Talk about
obfuscation. That was not my intent. I chose C because it is understood by a
large fraction of Agorans.

Actually, David, it would have been much more interesting if you had
hooked up a compiled version of your program to the Unix sendmail
command, with a small script to cut it up into smaller chunks (say,
50 lines or so) and mail these chunks to a-b at regular intervals
(say, one every three days at most, to avoid the risk of being
summarily unsubscribed from the lists for massive spamming). You
would have made your point in a rather more convincing manner.

I'm not even sure that your hypothetical program-specified post
would have the desired effect, even if it were determined that you
can legally attempt to require every Player to mentally construct, 
then examine for possibly valid Game Moves, a text of infinite 
length.

After a very, very long time your program would spit out the
following line :

   I hereby CFJ on the following infinitely long statement :

or, say

  The rest of this message is a new Proposal.

Your 'one action per line' provision attemps to circumvent such
problems, but I do not think it is effective; for one thing, it is
blatantly untrue - most lines of your messages would not constitute
valid Game Moves. Therefore, the possible set of actions you 
attempted is not infinite; it is the set of actions that can be 
expressed in a string shorter than the shortest string in the English 
language with a meaning similar to the one above.

Of course, in between, the program will have output

   I register

and

   I deregister

With a vastly smaller set of strings in between that might be 
interpreted as valid Game Moves, and apart from CFJs there is no 
other message from a deregistered Player which may have a legal 
effect on the game before the beginning of the next month.

There might even be shorter pairs of reg/dereg strings than the 
above, if we allow for some latitude in intepretation; for instance,
   I join
and
   I quit
between which in alphabetical order lie, I am reasonably sure, no 
message which may have any significance to Agora whatsoever.

Dear David,

 Unfortunately I don't speak C, and so cannot determine what your 
program actually does.

 So far I thought that the official language in Agora was English,
although I find no indication of this in the Rules. Which is why I
answer in German and hope that you can understand my puzzlement (?)
as well as provide some kind of translation of your program, in
English or German. Otherwise I will, insofar as my duties as 
Ambassador are concerned, simply ignore your mail.

 Sorry about my ignorance - I do all my Monte Carlo simulations in 
Fortran.

 All the best, Kolja A.

'find' in the second line of the second paragraph would probably better
be 'found'. 'Nachfrage' means 'request', especially 'request for information'.
The rest of the translation seems to be as it should be. But then I'm just
a simple dutchman too...

I don't know how I'd feel about that; I don't think "wishes"
is a particluarly good word to use, subjective as it is, and I'm not
sure how to interpret that.  I'd need a more rigorous wording
before I could comment one way or the other.

I suppose, if I had to, the above might be interpreted to
mean this: Suppose I wish to register, but not so much that
I am willing to pay $20 to play.  Given the above wording,
I would say that the Rule *still* imposes a legal obligation
on me to pay $20!  But as far as an attempt to register
without paying, I really can't say based on the above.

I don't remember enough German to respond in kind, but I do remember
enough to get the general gist here, so let me respond.  Although
I feel that English is and should remain the _de facto_ languague
of Agora, I also strongly feel that it should not be made the _de
jure_ official language, lest we get into arguments about what exactly
is and is not English, and whether "Rulekeepor" is English, und
so weiter.

Read the Rule.  That clause applies not to the voting entity, but to the
votes themselves.  "...their Votes on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and
cannot change thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding..."
seems pretty definite to me.

Its not a question of whether the sentence applies to *you*.  It
applies to *your votes*, which "cannot change thereafter."

Are you saying that the limit is not zero?  That's not what my first year
calculus course taught me.  According to what I was taught, that part of
your message could be rewritten (without changing its meaning) as:
"Each subsequent action is separated from the previous by a time equal to 
zero."

And, if you do not dispute this, then you must be arguing against my
assertion that a list of actions separated by no time all occur
simultaneously (unless some Rule says otherwise).  Rule 1527 does not
apply to your message, as it seemed to contain only one communication -
that being a statement that you were (attempting to)  perform a lot of
actions.  And just what does "simultaneously" mean, then?  Or do you
assert that a set of actions can be performed both simultaneously and
sequentially?

Rule 1527 works (IMO).  It states that "... the communications in that
message shall be taken to have been sent sequentially, separated by
infinitesimal increments of time ...", and an infinitesimal increment is
_not_ zero (that being the whole point of infinitesimals).

A C program isn't an abstract entity - at least, not to me.  I work with
them daily.  I also work with abstract mathematical entities daily (I'm a 
uni student studying Maths and CompSci).  This is the root of our
disagreement in the following matters.

I don't believe you.

How?

The key point is probably just how determined things have to be.  If you
mean "within a reasonably short time, a Player should have determined that
my program tries to generate all strings over the symbols listed", then I
agree with you.  But determining which strings constitute CFJs (for
example) would take forever.

What I was tryiny to say was:

1) If you wished to be clear, there are clearer ways of stating your
intent.  For example:
"Consider the set of all strings over the characters
'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ .,"', ordered by (increasing) length, with
strings of equal length being ordered lexically (using the order the
symbols appear in the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ .,"').  This is
the set of all the actions I wish to perform, in the order in which I wish
to perform them."
(and then you state the time frame in whish you (attempt to) perform them)

Or, perhaps you could have used an EBNF (or similar) grammar - shorter,
and also more readily understood by non-programmers.

2) If you had chosen C because it wasn't the clearest way of stating
things, there are other ways even less clear.
(although I didn't believe that you were trying to be obscure.  However,
it did take me a minute or so to work out _just_ what your program did)

(Also, inherent in the definition of a Turing Machine is the fact that it
has infinite storage capacity - but that wasn't why I mentioned them here)

But it applies to your Votes.  Had you not previously cast a Vote on
3581, I would grant that you might Vote.  But you had, and Rule 1717
is quite clear on the matter of changing it again.

You can't delegate - but you can resign.

I don't think the issues are all that similar. CFJ 1046 turned on the
wording of R911, which is irrelevant here. In particular, CFJ 1046
had nothing particularly to do with knowledge of the future.

>Maybe a similar CFJ would be appropriate for the current situation.

Nevertheless, a CFJ is probably in order.

That's how I read it.

I believe it is executed as normal. The net result is that Vir spends
a VT to ABSTAIN, which is returned to him, which was probably the
intended effect, the tortured grammar notwithstanding.

My proposed Judgment follows. I invite comment before I submit it. 

Judgment: FALSE

Reasoning: Transfers must be from one entity to another. The only
definition of Entity I can find in the Rules is in Rule 1586, which
defines Nomic Entities as:

	"Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
	Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
   	  Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

The above does not apply to the philosopher Plato nor, as far as I can
tell, to any other Plato either.

Now, it is possible that the "entity" referred to in the Transfer Rules
does not refer to Nomic entity. In this case, the term is undefined
(although we can tell that any Nomic entity is also an entity). If we
take the definition in my dictionary, an entiry is "Anything that exists
or may be supposed to exist". Can Plato be "supposed to exist"?
I have my doubts, and I am not sure whether he would agree. Either way,
I am inclined to Judge FALSE. If someone can point to a precedent for
interpreting entity as above, I will probably dismiss, as I do not
feel the resulting philosophical puzzle is resolvable, nor is it   
relevant for the game (as the precedent would already have been set).
