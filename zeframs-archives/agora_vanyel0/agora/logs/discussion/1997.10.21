I thought the whole point of not making the Speakership an Office was
to keep the Speakership immune from anything that breaks the Office Rules.

Scott's position, which is also mine, I believe, is perfectly consistent:
we want neither all Elections happening at different times, nor all
Elections happening at the same time, but rather to keep the present
system, in which it seems to happens that Elections come in batches
of about 3 or 4 at a time.

I disagree that this sidesteps the argument. I think Chuck's version
still effectively imposes a requirement on non-Players who wish to
register. That is, if we had a Rule that said that no Rule shall 
impose requirements on non-Players, then I would Judge that Chuck's
Rule conflicted with it.

But R663 also says that Injunctions must be of a type defined in the
Rules and be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules. I believe
Jeff's argument is to the effect that the type of Injunction defined
by R1736 is defined in such a way that in order to be issued in a
manner consistent with it, such an Injunction could require the making
of no more than one Payment Order.

I'm not even that fond of the '1997-02-03' format. I prefer 'Mon, 03 Feb
1997'.

Very nicely put. The idea is, then, that the real meta-game principle
with which we're playing is: the Rules may impose obligations on
non-Players precisely to the extent that we who follow those Rules
are prepared to enforce them.

I agree we need to tighten up the Officer Rules to ensure that only
Players can hold Office. An easy way to do this is pass a Power = 2
(or 3, but 2 should be high enough) Rule saying that if, for any
reason, a non-Player is holding an Office, e is removed from that
Office. (Inspired by the way the Filth Power in Cosmic Encounter
is worded: if, for any reason, another Player is sharing a base with
the Filth, that Player must immediately vacate that base.)

I will resist any move to make the Speaker an Office. The Speaker
not being an Office has proved time and again an effective line of
defence against wholesale screwup of the Officer Rules.

Circular argument. That's only true if you're already antecedently 
committed to the view that the Rules cannot impose obligations on
non-Players. Unless you think 'continue to play' means something
broader than 'continue to be a Player'.

As I read R113, it guarantees your right to deregister rather than
continue to be a Player. If the Rules can impose obligations on
non-Players (and I seem by stages to be coming around to the view
that they can), it doesn't guarantee you exemption from any such
obligations.

Hmmm. Good point! I suppose I have to retract my remark above. Players
have successfully appealed to the meta-game principle of impracticality
to justify ignoring the Rule-mandated state of the game, when it cannot
be determined what that is.

Sure, Pragmatic Currencies are broken as all hell - but look at all the
*fun* we're having! They'll be fixed in due course. During the meanwhilst,
there's no need for extreme measures like this. (But hey, that doesn't

If you mean 'current Rules' I don't think there are any that are
relying on retroactivity to have their desired effects. If there
were, I think that the new R108 would be self-applicable and prevent
itself from stopping those Rules from having whatever effects they
are currently having in the past. ('Currently having in the past'?
Where is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner when I really need him?). To do that,
the new Rule 108 would itself have to act in the past, and that is
precisely what it forbids other Rules and itself from doing.

If you mean future Rules, retroactive effects seem to be needed
mostly for patching up emergency situations, like the PI Blots or the
Immunity Crisis. Proposals and Rules which seek to have such
retroactive effects can override R108 by having Adoption Indices
greater than 3. I think that's appropriate.

There are still some bugs in this, see below. I think we need to come
to some agreement on how to handle this. I agree, for instance, that
your amendment to R1016 is preferable to mine. But I can't take my
amendment out, because the two amendments should be bundled together.
If the amendment to R1042 passed and the amendment to R1016 failed,
it would be a little embarrassing.

Ignore my previous remark about priority; that was childish of me.
What I think we should do is make the Proposal jointly, by which I
mean that you can propose it, and we tack on a provision specifying
ourselves as joint Authors, a la my recent Proposal to amend R108,
which owed a lot to Chuck.

Here are the changes I want made to your proto before I'll support it:

1. 'Present' changed to 'Here' or some other word if you can find one
as good.  'Here' is not ideal, but since we can't use 'Present'
(as it's already in use), it's the best I've thought of so far. 

2. 'any particular' becomes 'another'; this avoids the paradox resulting
from posts of "I hereby cause myself to become Quiet.", after which the
Rule states that I am Present/Here (first para.), that I am Quiet (second 
para.), and that I am exactly one of these (first para.).

3. 'eight weeks' becomes 'two months'.

4. The requirement that Registrar announce the deregistration should
be worded more stringently, as follows:

      In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as possible,
      confirm or deny in the Public Forum that the deregistration has
      actually occurred.

which requires the registrar to make an announcement even if the
deregistration has *not* occurred for some reason.

5. Incorporate my proposed change to the Registrar's Report. (This
is probably the most negotiable point).

6. Bundle up your amendment to R1016 so that these are one Proposal.

7. Add the co-Authorship provision.

Do you agree? If not, I can always make the changes myself (including
the co-Authorship) and propose it myself.

I think the second paragraph probably *is* completely redundant.
It certainly says nothing that R1011 doesn't already say, and I half
suspect that R1011 doesn't say anything much.

Not correct.  1997-10-14 was the day that three Players deregistered;
the last of the three was Antimatter at 15:16:40.  At the time quoted
above, therefore, there were 18 Players, all Active.

I'm pretty sure the Judgement was simply that the message becomes
effective when it reaches the PF.  There's a note to that effect in
the FLR.  I do recall some Officers having a convention of using the
Date: header when it is approximately correct, but I think that was
just a convenience to avoid having to look at all the headers, and has
no legal basis.

It requires a majority of Senators.  The additional requirement for two
Senators is to avoid scams if there should ever be very few Players.

An Application seems better suited.  I suppose one could use an
Application to trigger an Election, wih the Application naming the Vote
Collector, but using the Application directly shortens the whole process
by a week or two.  I think requiring a majority to sign the Application
is sufficient safeguard.

There are high-Power Rules that ensure that there is always a Speaker.
If the low-Power Rules then govern Speaker changes in the same way as
the Offices, that's fine -- if the Officer Rules break, 103 et al. ensure
that there is still a Speaker.

Well, that is one way of looking at it. In which case, I would say
that elJefe's argument is an argument that the relevant Judgement
contained 4 definitely illegal, rather than a larger number of
possibly inappropriate, Injunctions. Rule 663 *defines* an Injunction
as an "order requiring one or more Players to perform, or refrain
form performing, one or more actions". It then goes on to state
additional requirements that an Injunction must satisfy, in 
particular that it must be 'consistent with the Rules'.

I suppose it is reasonable to claim that the Injunctions authorized
by Rule 1736 are subject to an additional requirement in that they
may not require the Player(s) to whom they apply to execute more than
one PO. But it is quite a step from that to asserting that a single
command requiring a Player to execute multiple Injunctions is,
because of that, more than one Injunction.

You can of course still maintain that the wording of the relevant 
Injunctions was such that it makes more sense to interpret them as 
many Injunctions, each requiring a Player or Players to execute 
exactly one Payment Order; but such a claim would be no more 
believable than the alternative; here is, again, one of the relevant 
Injunctions :

   I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
   applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
   Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
   Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
   Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
   have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

If we are to rely strictly on the wording of the command - and the
count of 40-some Injunction does precisely that - then you must also
grant that the above clearly requires of each Player involved to
execute more than one Payment Order - precisely as many as there were
Players at that time. IOW, as someone else as suggested, the precise
structure of the above is 'I hereby issue Injunctions, applying to
Player(s) <X>, requiring them to perform action <Y>'.

Judge Vir's opinion is that this should be parsed as 'I hereby issue
an Injunction applying to <X>, requiring them to perform <Y>'.
Whereas the position defended by Andre, elJefe and yourself is that
this should be parsed as 'I hereby issue an Injunction requiring <X>
to perform Y1, and an Injunction requiring <X> to perform Y2, etc.'.
Neither claim, it seems to me, has more merit than the other. (I'll 
readily admit, of course, that I am to blame for the confusion !)

Our approaches are both, I think, copied from the current Rule.  I didn't
read your proto in detail before producing mine -- just noting the
terminology, and your note that you'd abolished the Abandoning state.

If yours becomes functionally identical to mine (I think the last revision
left out an `Active' somewhere) then I'll support it.

There are still some bugs in this, see below. I think we need to come
to some agreement on how to handle this. I agree, for instance, that
your amendment to R1016 is preferable to mine. But I can't take my
amendment out, because the two amendments should be bundled together.
If the amendment to R1042 passed and the amendment to R1016 failed,
it would be a little embarrassing.

Ignore my previous remark about priority; that was childish of me.
What I think we should do is make the Proposal jointly, by which I
mean that you can propose it, and we tack on a provision specifying
ourselves as joint Authors, a la my recent Proposal to amend R108,
which owed a lot to Chuck.

Here are the changes I want made to your proto before I'll support it:

1. 'Present' changed to 'Here' or some other word if you can find one
as good.  'Here' is not ideal, but since we can't use 'Present'
(as it's already in use), it's the best I've thought of so far. 

2. 'any particular' becomes 'another'; this avoids the paradox resulting
from posts of "I hereby cause myself to become Quiet.", after which the
Rule states that I am Present/Here (first para.), that I am Quiet (second 
para.), and that I am exactly one of these (first para.).

3. 'eight weeks' becomes 'two months'.

4. The requirement that Registrar announce the deregistration should
be worded more stringently, as follows:

      In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as possible,
      confirm or deny in the Public Forum that the deregistration has
      actually occurred.

which requires the registrar to make an announcement even if the
deregistration has *not* occurred for some reason.

5. Incorporate my proposed change to the Registrar's Report. (This
is probably the most negotiable point).

6. Bundle up your amendment to R1016 so that these are one Proposal.

7. Add the co-Authorship provision.

Do you agree? If not, I can always make the changes myself (including
the co-Authorship) and propose it myself.

I think the second paragraph probably *is* completely redundant.
It certainly says nothing that R1011 doesn't already say, and I half
suspect that R1011 doesn't say anything much.

Not correct.  1997-10-14 was the day that three Players deregistered;
the last of the three was Antimatter at 15:16:40.  At the time quoted
above, therefore, there were 18 Players, all Active.

I'm pretty sure the Judgement was simply that the message becomes
effective when it reaches the PF.  There's a note to that effect in
the FLR.  I do recall some Officers having a convention of using the
Date: header when it is approximately correct, but I think that was
just a convenience to avoid having to look at all the headers, and has
no legal basis.

It requires a majority of Senators.  The additional requirement for two
Senators is to avoid scams if there should ever be very few Players.

An Application seems better suited.  I suppose one could use an
Application to trigger an Election, wih the Application naming the Vote
Collector, but using the Application directly shortens the whole process
by a week or two.  I think requiring a majority to sign the Application
is sufficient safeguard.

Can't really be done.  From the child nomic's point of view, nothing
that happens in Agora can affect it directly.  We'll just have to make
sure they terminate nicely.

Yes, I'll work on that in the next version.

There are high-Power Rules that ensure that there is always a Speaker.
If the low-Power Rules then govern Speaker changes in the same way as
the Offices, that's fine -- if the Officer Rules break, 103 et al. ensure
that there is still a Speaker.

Well, that is one way of looking at it. In which case, I would say
that elJefe's argument is an argument that the relevant Judgement
contained 4 definitely illegal, rather than a larger number of
possibly inappropriate, Injunctions. Rule 663 *defines* an Injunction
as an "order requiring one or more Players to perform, or refrain
form performing, one or more actions". It then goes on to state
additional requirements that an Injunction must satisfy, in 
particular that it must be 'consistent with the Rules'.

I suppose it is reasonable to claim that the Injunctions authorized
by Rule 1736 are subject to an additional requirement in that they
may not require the Player(s) to whom they apply to execute more than
one PO. But it is quite a step from that to asserting that a single
command requiring a Player to execute multiple Injunctions is,
because of that, more than one Injunction.

You can of course still maintain that the wording of the relevant 
Injunctions was such that it makes more sense to interpret them as 
many Injunctions, each requiring a Player or Players to execute 
exactly one Payment Order; but such a claim would be no more 
believable than the alternative; here is, again, one of the relevant 
Injunctions :

   I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
   applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
   Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
   Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
   Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
   have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

If we are to rely strictly on the wording of the command - and the
count of 40-some Injunction does precisely that - then you must also
grant that the above clearly requires of each Player involved to
execute more than one Payment Order - precisely as many as there were
Players at that time. IOW, as someone else as suggested, the precise
structure of the above is 'I hereby issue Injunctions, applying to
Player(s) <X>, requiring them to perform action <Y>'.

Judge Vir's opinion is that this should be parsed as 'I hereby issue
an Injunction applying to <X>, requiring them to perform <Y>'.
Whereas the position defended by Andre, elJefe and yourself is that
this should be parsed as 'I hereby issue an Injunction requiring <X>
to perform Y1, and an Injunction requiring <X> to perform Y2, etc.'.
Neither claim, it seems to me, has more merit than the other. (I'll 
readily admit, of course, that I am to blame for the confusion !)

Our approaches are both, I think, copied from the current Rule.  I didn't
read your proto in detail before producing mine -- just noting the
terminology, and your note that you'd abolished the Abandoning state.

If yours becomes functionally identical to mine (I think the last revision

`Present' is already used, but in a sufficiently different context that
I don't think the reuse is a problem.  `Here' sounds rathert awkward.
I'll try to think of something better.

I don't think it's a paradox.  I interpret such a message as the Player
posting to the PF (becoming Present) and then, infinitesemally later,
causing emself to become Quiet.  However, I don't have a problem with
this change, to avoid the debate.

The Rule currently has `sixty days' there.  I'm not going to make a
backward step.

This always seemed silly to me.  The Rule basically says "if ... the
Player is deregistered, and the Registrar shall confirm whether or not
e was deregistered".  If the Player wasn't deregistered, then the Rule
doesn't fire and the Registrar isn't bound to do anything.  It'll have
to be done in a different way, with the reporting requirement triggering
on an *attempt* to deregister, rather than the deregistration.

What was that?

The two changes are fairly independent of each other.  Why do you think

"Copying RL law"?  I did not (consciously) copy any real life law in

Already has connotations from R113, and looks as if it's linked to

It's not copying any actual law, but it's copying a RL legal *principle*.
Furthermore, it's copying a RL concept when we already have an equivalent
Agoran concept (Contests can do everying the old Contracts could, except
in that they are public).

Neither current Contests nor the previously existing Contracts most
emphatically cannot perform the same thing that the contract law I
propose can do.  And we need a contract law if we intend to establish
an economy.

As far as copying a real-life legal principle, so what?  Practically
all of our concents are copied from real life.  Do you think the idea
of voting was original to Agora?  Judging?  Currencies?  All I am
suggesting is that we make use of our CFJ mechanism to enforce
agreements between Players.  Yes, real life courts do this.  So what?
Are we obliged to reject an idea merely because other people do it
too?

Let's abolish Months AND Weeks. Let's use a calendar based on the number of
days since Agora's inception, counting from 0.

For larger periods, we could use dekadays, hectadays, and kilodays.

Crito's mailer appends "-Reply" to the end of the Subject: header of 
reply messages. It also seems to use the first line of the message as
the Subject: header, rather than having a separate field for it, which
is what leads to all of the messages with the attribution in the
Subject.

I don't see a great advantage in using a different calendar for Agora.
Still, if you Propose to make this the Official Agoran Calendar, you'll
have my vote.

I note that recently many blots came into circulation due to mistakes
that officers made (failure to report etc.). I don't mind that in
principle, but maybe this risk of being an officer deserves some
balancing? 

I'd suggest doubling the chance of officers to receive indulgences in
the indulgence lottery: this would balance the above risk and, at the
same time, introduce another incentive to run for office. 

This would make elections more like in real life (it's not only
idealism that drives people into politics...), and for those who don't
care about modelling real life it would still increase the politicking
aspect of the game. 

And it would increase the economic inequality that we will probably
need to get an economy going - just as VTs are very unevenly
distributed at the moment. (And although I'm one of the "poor"
players, I think this uneven distribution is a good thing - at least
for me it introduces new, economic factors into my decision making).

--> proto:

amend 1712 by adding: 

"The probability to select a player who holds one or more offices must
be twice that for other players. In this respect this rule takes
precedence over other rules defining 'randomness'."

Although zefram has just made a proposal that gets all the old
currencies running again, I wonder whether now might be a good time to
simplify things and abolish P-notes, at least for the time being.

In several recent discussions about the economic aspects of Agora it
was remarked that a currenca driven economy is getting underway quite
well at the moment: there was a lot of dealing for indulgences, and
even after a PI amnesty blots will keep flying for various
infractions. And VTs are scarce, too (at least for some of us...), at
least at the moment.

On the other hand, it was noted that P-notes are neither scarce nor
really necessary for participating in the game - the only drawback of
making disinterested proposals is that the proposer does not get
listed as coauthor of the created/amended rule(s). And even that
could, in principle, be overridden by explicit clauses in proposals
(like Steve's recent proposal that makes Chuck a coauthor). 

Pro making interested proposals: possibility to immortalize your name
as a listed author (well, at least until the rule is
repealed...). Contra: if you fail, you may run into P-note debt with
all the hassle involved. What's the point then?

Summa: I'm not sure we really need P-notes at the moment (even the
promotor will not become redundant without them), so why not abolish
them, and maybe reintroduce them when VTs and indulgences are stably
underway, the PC dust has settled and we need some new toys to break?

What ! Why should we have to bother with an old-fashioned decimal 
system ? I say Hexadecimal should be the official base for all Agora 
business.

Octal is, of course, better suited to human mental capabilites, and no
self-respecting nomic should consider using anything else.

If you're using "Quiet", then perhaps "Loud" or "Noisy"?

I think perhaps the only fair thing to do is to measure time in spins of 
the cesium atom. This has two main advantages: first, times can be 
specified with a great deal of accuracy, with an integral number of spins 
since Agora began; second, for those players not progressive enough to 
completely adopt this new system, only minor mathematical calculations 
are involved in conversion to standard time.

I was thinking instead of oscillations of an unionized hydrogen atom,
but cesium will do too.

I thought of that, too. But it's too close to 'Player'.

Indded! As Zefram has so incisively pointed out, we often need to
resolve the order of events separated by mere seconds. *Obviously*,
we should simply count the number of seconds since Agora's inception,
starting from 0. In octal, naturally.

Has a certain boisterous charm, I'll admit.

I think that's a can of worms we'd be better off not opening.

I just don't understand this defence. It seems obvious to me that
the latter reading has far more merit than the former, just because
it is consistent with what you actually wrote, in the way that the
former is not. You did not write "I hereby issue an Injunction...";
you wrote "I hereby issue Injunctions...".

I'm curious: on what basis do you interpret the Rule as causing the Player
to become Quiet after they become Present?

I think 'two months' is a *forward* step from 'sixty days', and from
'eight weeks'. I think the great majority of Players agree with me,
and I suspect that if you don't change it to 'two months', the Proposal
will not pass (even though the current wording is 'sixty days').

The Rule as currently worded, and your proto, have that conditional
construction which you rightly criticize. My proto does not, and it
is superior in to both in that respect. If the deregistration does
not occur for some reason, the Registrar should be required to make
an announcement to that effect.

The one that requires the Registrar to note transitions between
what we are now calling, I believe, Noisy, Quiet and Absent.

They aren't quite independent: the amendment to R1042 uses the word
'Active', which the amendment to R1016 properly defines. I agree that
'Active' already has this definition by default, so perhaps it's not
a big point.

I think on balance, I should produce a proto reflecting what I think
the changes should be, since there still seems to be some disagreement
on some points. You can then tell me whether you're prepared to support
it.

Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence v1.4

[Comment: in the end, the amendment to R1016 that actually puts the
definition of 'Active' and 'Inactive' back in R1016 can remain separate,
since we all agree that 'Active' already has this definition by game
custom. Zefram's proto to amend R1016 handles this handsomely. This
version differs from Zefram's only in minor details: I prefer 'two
months' to 'eight weeks'; I have the Registrar make an announcement
if the deregistration does not occur for some reason; I include a
requirement that the Registrar note transitions between being Noisy,
Quiet and Absent.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1042 be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Absent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Absent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Absent.

      Any Player can cause an Absent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Absent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Absent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Absent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 1042 are Steve and Zefram.

I think I see what you're getting at, although I'm not quite sure,
but I feel that things like that are probably more trouble than they're
worth.  I don't know if there's any easy way to distinguish between
"wanted" and "unwanted" retroactive effects.

Hm. But if we're going with 'Noisy' and 'Quiet', then surely
we must replace 'Absent' with 'Silent', yes?

Easter is difficult even if you're going by months. :/

Proto-Proposal
Straighten out Absence v1.5

[Comment: the last piece of the puzzle: 'Absence' itself must become
'Silence' (or, rather, 'Absent' must become 'Silent') to complete the
series suggested by 'Noisy' and 'Quiet'. I have kept the title of the
Proposal as 'Straighten out Absence' to reflect its origins, but changed
the Title of the Rule.]

[Comment: in the end, the amendment to R1016 that actually puts the
definition of 'Active' and 'Inactive' back in R1016 can remain separate,
since we all agree that 'Active' already has this definition by game
custom. Zefram's proto to amend R1016 handles this handsomely. This
version differs from Zefram's only in minor details: I prefer 'two
months' to 'eight weeks'; I have the Registrar make an announcement
if the deregistration does not occur for some reason; I include a
requirement that the Registrar note transitions between being Noisy,
Quiet and Silent.]

Be it hereby resolved that the Title of Rule 1042 be changed to
'Deregistration due to Silence', and that it be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause an Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 1042 are Steve and Zefram.

And almost unnoticeable if you go by spins of a cesium atom. You're
too busy counting them to notice anything else. :)

Erg.  There isn't any way to keep those to yourself, but allow
any message sent to the lists to go through without trapping?

Oddly, this reply of Chuck's bounced, thanks to my use of the words
's-bscription' and 'uns-bscription', only with the 'u's back in,
obviously. This time, I used the approve script to pass the message
on, so it appears without the ugly headers Zefram (I think it was
Zefram) was complaining about.

Concerning your question, it does appear to be that way. Although
the list owner info does say that most of the message trapping checks
can be turned off if they're found to be too restrictive, as far as I
can tell, this applies only to messages trapped because they match
the list of taboo strings given in the list config file. But that
list is empty for all three of the Agora lists. Our problem is
messages that get trapped because they appear to majordomo to be
malformed attempts at giving it instructions, and I don't know
of any way to turn that function off or modify its behaviour, short
of modifying the source code to majordomo, which you can imagine I'm
prepared to do, or even capable of doing. If anyone knows does know
how change this aspect of majordomo's operations, please speak up.

In the meantime, I'm going to switch the administrivia option off.
If there's a loud clamour against it, I can always switch it on again.

Well said.  I've become something of a fan in LiS just in
the last few months (now that the SciFi channel shows it
just about the time I'm getting up), and I'd be all for it if this had
been proposed early enough to declare the day prior to its
actual occurrence, but as it is I'll either vote against or not vote.
Just because we can declare days like this after they've occurred
doesn't mean we should.

Why?  What harm is there in having playerless, functionally
dead nomics floating out in Platonia?

How far in the future? Is Kolja's clock wrong? Gecko is running slow,
not fast.

Well, Officers already have a VT advantage. Do we want to give them
an Indulgence advantage as well? Or are they already sufficently
compensated for the risks of Office? Of course there's plenty of
room for disagreement about the answers to such questions, but my
own feeling, off the bat, is that they are already sufficiently 
compensated. YMMV.

Blob's Judgement is 5 days overdue (and Blob has now been deregistered).
Time for a reassignment.
