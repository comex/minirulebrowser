Actually, as far as the Rule limit goes, Suber's Initial Sets both
set a limit of 25 Mutable Rules (I think this is one of things
Suber added so Players would have obvious targets for their first
few Rule Changes).  And actually, the board isn't in the Bluesmobile
Initial Set, just in the current Rules, although BoardNomic *does*
have a game board in its Initial Set (a URL for BoardNomic was
recently posted on the Nomic BBS).

Accepting the truth of a message is not the same as accepting it as a
Judgement.  If the situation in question arises, and Morendil submits a
"Judgement" stating that e is not Speaker, then the message is either a
truthful non-Judgement or an incorrect Judgement.

Appelate decisions take precedence, so we just have acknowledge that
CFJ 1054 is either wrong, or we believe Andre's attempt to make it
conform with the decision in CFJ 1053.

I haven't been following the case at all, so don't really know the ins
and outs of the matter, but sometimes one just has to grin and bear
the Courts' decisions.

Count Quorum not for Proposals, but for batches. If a Player takes an
action on ANY Proposal of a batch, e counts as present for ALL Proposals
in that batch.
<<

That would completely eliminate the "no vote" as a "cheap" against
vote we have at the moment. That may be overdoing it a bit. elJefe's
use of this was to revert an already cast vote into such a no vote
later. If we only want to avoid this latter idea, we do not have to
abolish the possibility to intentionally cast non-votes altogether.

I don't see that. Lowering Quorum will not increase complexity or

Lowering quorum won't, of course. What I meant is that Public Voting
plus lowered quorum wouldn't be very different fromthe situation
before the public voting experiment, or at least that the very
interesting aspect of public voting discovered by elJefe would be
abolished completely before we've had a chance to play with it some
more.

How? Calabresi and Vanyel are no more likely to declare Absence than
they are to declare Presence.

Ah, now _this_ certainly is a strong argument to lower quorum. It has
nothing to do with elJefe's no vote idea, and not too much with public
voting, but it is certainly a good point.

That appears quite consistent with at least my own ruling, which was 
to the effect that one can be a Player's Executor in Probate without 
being that Player's Executor.

I disagree that it is being ignored. My ruling specifically rules out 
the possibility that a non-Player may be an Executor, and makes 
reference to at least one previous Judgement. I also don't see a 
reference to 1054 in elJefe's decision.

I invite you, Steve, to reread my ruling in 1053 and point out any
perceived flaws in my reasoning. I might add that until I sat down
to consider the Judgement I was, as you know, persuaded of the
interpretation opposite to that I ended up reaching, but which
nevertheless is the one I feel is mandated by a close reading of the
Rules.

Not really. As I intimated in an earlier, private mail to Steve,
finding *myself* in the position of a Zombie made me quite reluctant
to support the aims of the Voodoo conspiracy. Oerjan recognized that
and pointed out to me the opportunity to defeat the conspiracy by
this method, and in that he was, I think, brilliantly pursuing his
role as head of the opposition to the conspiracy.

I believe that the Rules themselves are contradictory in this
respect. Again, the reason that leads me to believe that is the
situation that obtains with respect to non-Player Officers, and the
implications of this situation as to our interpretation of 'clauses
of qualification' as opposed to 'clauses of instalment' in various
Rules. Rule 1478's provision that a Player's Executor is a person
who is empowered to act on behalf of that Player is a clause of
qualification, i.e. it states that none but a Player may be granted
this authority; Rule 1738's provision that a person who is granted
such status by the Notary becomes an Executor in Probate is a clause
of instalment, and as such only requires that that person be a Player 
at the time this status is granted.

I should think it obvious what 'abstract' means.  VTs have no physical
existence.

And this is precisely what our Rules do *not* do.  They make no specification
of which entities are capable of "possessing" Currencies.  This is completely
unspecified.  Currency holdings are really just an "account" of information
recorded by the various Recordkeepors.  If the rules do not specify which
entities may or may not have accounts, then nothing, commonsense
notwithstanding, physically prevents the Recordkeepor from keeping an account
for *any* entity.  Letting "commonsense" determine who or what can "possess"
VTs is vague, potentially contentious, and seems particularly un-Agoran to me. 
But that's just my opinion.

>Both Vlad and Michael in recent Judgements have elucidated principles

Use of commonsense seems to be rather selective at times around here.  However,
I do not think that commonsense helps much here.  This possession of VTs
involved Plato, someone whom everyone knows is dead.  But what if one of the
current Players should unexpectedly die and other Players are made aware of
this?  There is work to be done to adjust the game state to remove all
Currencies from the dead Player.  To me, commonsense would seem to come down on
the side of the dead Player "possessing" the Currencies until that work is
completed.  After all, when I die, my bank accounts will still contain whatever
meager funds I have at that time, until my relatives or some lawyers complete
the process of closing them.  To say that commonsense dictates we can't
transfer VTs to Plato (it is really transferring it to Plato's account, not to
Plato himself), is as fallacious as saying you can't put money into the pocket
of a corpse, IMNSHO.

>I therefore call for the Appeal of CFJ 1062.

Good.  This does require a close look by the board.  I'm curious to see what
kind of "commonsense" is prevalent around here.  I promise I won't leave In a
Huff, though.  8)

I disagree completely.  It is only legal statutes and bank policies that
prevent me from opening up an account somewhere in the name of the ancient
Greek philosopher, or any other dead person.  Our Rules establish no such
statutory or policy limitations.  I do not think my judgement of 1062 conflicts
in any way with the above judgement.  Your version of commonsense seems to me
to be insisting on interpreting "possession" in a physical sense, which I think
unwarranted for VTs (or money in RL bank accounts).

And curiously, one that I as a Platonist am sympathetic to, although not
for both reasons Crito give - I don't accept that Currency Holdings are
merely what the Recordkeepors record, but I do accept that they are
sufficiently abstract that it is not immediately reasonable that physical
possession should be a perfect analogy.

If a Rule makes an easily performed requirement on the recording of
abstract entities it is not IMHO reasonable to use Common Sense to declare
this impossible and void.

To be precise, I don't believe that Currency Holdings are merely what the
Recordkeepors record, but what they are *required* (supposed) to record, a view
that is not incompatible with the Platonic view.  (And note that this is the
wording I used in my judgement.)

Presumably the above is OK since you explained your notation, but the

Swann,

I noticed that you did not request a specific AI
for your proposal, making it default to 1.  I
haven't had a chance to check yet, is this

I think you're oversimplifying Michael's Judgement.  My understanding
is that the point is not just that Plato is dead, but that Plato is
*long* dead, in fact long before Agora was founded.  I would 
agree with you that if I died unexpectdly, I would continue
to own Currencies after my death.  But this does not mean that
years after my death, well after my Estate was settled, I could
still own Currencies.

If we wanted people to vote on every proposal, we'd eliminate the cost

Considering that in the United States less than 50% vote in off-year
Congressional elections, and sometimes less than 10% vote in local
elections, I don't see your point.  Many deliberative assemblies
operate on very low quorums (20% is common in fraternal assemblies, and
I think quorum in my old church's Council of Voters was 5%).

Michael's Judgement has to do with a VT owning another VT, not with the length
of time Plato has been dead.  In any case, there is nothing in the Rules that
distinguishes how long one must be dead before one becomes incapable of owning
Currencies.  If logically one is capable of possessing Currencies while dead
for a short time, then there is no *logical* argument to prevent someone from
owning Curencies after being dead for millenia.  These are not the kind of
"common sense" arguments I expect to see in Agora being applied as such a broad
principle.  I'm especially surprised to see it coming from people who's powers
of logic and whose opinions I respect so highly.  It makes me wonder if these
arguments are being driven to some extent by a desire to see a little of the
wind taken out of Zefram's Huff.

IIRC, the final outcome of CFJs on this issues determined that such messages
should be considered valid POs.  Though, I too, would be more comfortable if
Michael would be more explicit.

I really oppose granting any legal significance to "batches".  Also,
as Assessor I am worried that the modification you suggest will
considerably complicate my duties.

Simply lowering quorum should suffice.

I withheld my votes in the hopes of confusing the Zombiemasters into
thinking that I might be on their side.  Also, the Assessorship (which
is blissfully unburdened by Rule 452 by the PVE) privileges me
somewhat in that it is not an extra burden to record Votes: I have to
do so anyway.  I therefore know exactly how each Proposal is doing all
the time, and, because of the PVE, I am free to act upon that
knowledge.  Take that, Rule 452! :)

Was that not in response to a Viral infection of Rule 1579 (since
disinfected)?  Rule 1579's self-disinfection would have wreaked the
destruction of any Currency which, at that time, was Minted by a
Player.

That's the whole point of Probate.  

The skeleton I have in mind for revising Probate is:

              1.  Entity enters Probate
ASAP after 1: 2.  Notary announces EIP
ASAP after 2: 3.  All RKs must provide currency records to EIP
ASAP after 3: 4.  EIP formulates Probate Plan according to Probate
		  Code, posts plan to PF, awaits objection
7d after 4:   5a. If no objections to Plan within seven days, EIP
                  implements plan and terminates Probate.
              5b. If objection to Plan, EIP either reformulates plan
                  (return to 4) or CFJs on foundedness of objection
		  (if CFJ grants foundation, return to 4; if CFJ
		  denies foundation, proceed to 5a; probate deferred
		  during pendency of CFJ)

As an aside, it might be an idea to provide a general mechanism for
staying or tolling things during the pendency of COEs, CFJs, and
Appeals.  There are a number of such specific mechanisms in the Rules,
all quite similar; generalizing them might be a good idea.

Considering that in the United States less than 50% vote in off-year

I'd rather not get drawn into too longwinded political discussions
here... but: of course I am aware of such examples, too. In many
German universities leftis political groups control yearly budgets of
the order of millions of marks, being reelected again and again in
elections with a turnout way below 10%.

I'd just say that such systems are not very "democratic", and while
formally correct I still do not think it is quite proper to call
people elected by such a small proportion of potential voters
"representatives" of these voters. It doesn't sound very good in
English, but I like to call such systems "activocracies" - get
involved, be a candidate, and bingo, you're elected and working.

I don't see what the problem is.  First, recall that commonsense [sic]
is one of the preferred standards for Judgmenet in R217.  Now, I
would submit to you that it is common sense that 1) a dead person
may own things, if e has been dead only a short time, or if people
are unaware of eir death or have been aware of eir death only a short time;
and 2) a long-dead person (when it is generally known for a long time that
e is dead) may not own things.

IMO, it is a perversion of common sense for you to deny #2.

You seem to be saying that since we cannot identify clearly
the point at which a dead person can no longer own things, this
is not a "logical" position.  I disagree.  Logic does not require
that all distinctions be crystal clear and easily definable.

As for a logical argument to support this, try this on for size:
In general, *only* the living are allowed to own things.  However, an
exception is made for those who have only been known to have been dead a
short time, or those who are not known to be dead, on pragmatic grounds.

Consider the following: if I die without leaving a will, my possessions
may be disposed of according to law--something which would be outright
theft if I were alive.  So we see that even when the dead can own things,
the nature of such ownership is radically different than
ownership by a living person.

I believe this still needs serious review and examination before we

The exact point at which a deceased person ceases to be able to own
Currencies is not clear, but I am reasonably convinced that Plato is
far past it.  He's been dead for over two thousand years.

It might however become important if it is shown that Morendil was not
Speaker anyhow, such that some of the Zombie Votes were counted (possibly
not all, since EiP's were wrong for some of them.)

Although then Vir's Votes would count too, unless for some reason the
cancellations and On Hold problems conspired against his attempts to
change his Votes so that they ended up as cancelled...

A delightful mess. :-)

True, with respect to *physical* ownership.  But my point is we are not talking
about physical ownership.  Does not Plato "own" or "possess" certain
properties?  He is generally know to have been dead for a long time, yet he
still possesses the property of having been a Greek philosopher.  I will be
convinced if you and the others can show me why physical ownership is a
requirement for owning VTs, which have no physical existence.  I'm afraid I'm
not convinced by the argument that, well, we want to *pretend* that they have
physical existence.

It may not require it, but in this case it seems to me to be clear.  Either a
dead person can own Currencies or e cannot, logically.  Any restrictions put on
this wrt to time of death are legislative, not logical.

Again, this is true for physical ownership.  In general we allow both the
living and the dead to possess properties.

Again, physical ownership is what you are talking about.  Things being disposed
of according to law is a legislative issue built around a person having the
property of being dead.  I stick by my point that there is no such legislation
in Agora.

It comes down to this:

1.  Convince me that a capacity for physical ownership is required to possess
    things with no physical existence.
or
2.  Convince me that a dead person is not an "entity" for the purposes of
    the Currency transfer Rules.
or
3.  Convince me that there are other proprties of entities that the Rules
    allow us to use in preventing them from being the target of a Currency
    transfer.

Last, in recalling that commonsense [sic] is one of the preferred standards for
Judgmenet in R217, this makes sense when applied on a case by case basis.  IMO,
it does not work to try to generalize the common sense used by one judge in one
case into a broad principle for determining the judgements of other judges in
other cases.  Whose common sense is to be used?  Only yours, mine, Steve's, the
original judge's?  It is not really possible to insist that my judgement is in
conflict with Michael's because e used common sense and I did not.  As a matter
of fact, I may agree with Michael's judgement, although probably for different
reasons than Michael.  It is just that my common sense tells me that Plato is
capable of having a Currency account in Agora.  Others may disagree and the
Apellate court may overrule me, but IMO, R217 does not force me to use
Michael's or anyone's version of common sense but my own. If I am overruled it
will be because the Appellate court will be applying a different standard of
"common sense" in CFJ1062 than I used, not because I was supposed to use
Michael's common sense (although their's may be more in line with Michael's
then).

On what do you base the fact that there is any such point?

Although Distributor is not an Office, R1670 does require you to pay out
1 VT to the Distributor at the beginning of the week. Could you check
to make sure you did this last week, too?

Nolo contondere. Oerjan played superbly. However, consider that had
you joined the conspiracy, we would have arranged for the speedy
termination of your Probate, you would likely have shared in a Win,
and Oerjan's Proposal would eventually have been passed anyway. That
outcome is clearly better for you than the one that eventuated,
and it was in your power to bring it about - yet you chose not to,
possibly because you acted hastily at Oerjan's prompting, rather than
stopping to see if you really had considered all the alternatives. 
So I don't think your own play in this case was optimal. Oh well,
it happens. I've let wins slip thourgh my fingers before with hasty
play.

Is this going to turn into a debate about Sorites paradoxes? Goody!

I would say that there is no *exact* point at which a deceased person
ceases to be able to own Currencies. There is, however, a kind of
vague, blurry and smeared 'point'. And Plato is far past it.

On the obvious fact that it is far from common sense to allow

I point out that this game is called Nomic, not Logic.  There is a
difference in quality between logical reasoning and legal reasoning.

If it is found that Morendil was not in fact Speaker, I would, of
course, recompute the report entirely.  I have amended my internal
records, and note that no changes of significance arise to explain why
I am not posting a revised copy of the Voting Report.

Perhaps.  Of course, it is arguable that democracy is not a
particularly good form of government, especially when the majority of
the voters are sufficiently disinterested on most issues such that the
cost of voting exceeds the benefits.

Fine.  Now point out for me what *legal* reasoning within Agora prevents dead
people from owning Currency.

I don't know from Sorites paradoxes, but my question was, what is the basis for
believing there is *any* such point, even a vague, blurry, smeared one?

Why is that far from common sense?  The kind of common sense I've come to
expect from Agorans is one that has a rational basis that can be explained. 
"It is common sense because [some reasonable explanation]."  Not, "it's common
sense because it's common sense."

I have a feeling I've stumbled onto one of those "Thou shalt not make waves too
high" issues.  What's puzzling to me is why such an inconsequential wave should
be considered too high.

Agora is not a representative democracy to begin with, but a
participatory democracy. So your points about Quorum in
representative democracies are probably not applicable here.

More's the pity. We're missing out on lots of interesting politics that
way. Imagine a Nomic with a hundred or more players, and a real elected

Now _that_ would be fun.  But finding a hundred or more people who
want to play Nomic over the net has proven challenging in the
extreme.

With all our recent departures and the disappearance of the zombies, our 
player list is suddenly looking shrunken. What I'm suddenly realizing is
that five of our current players registered after me. Eeek, I suddenly feel
so *old*... :)

But that's easy. For myself, when thinking about Currencies, I keep
it always before me that Nomic originated as a face to face game, and
that it is useful to think about Currencies in terms of how such
things are treated in face to face games such as Poker and Monopoly.
This is what I mean by 'commonsense'. Now, a Monopoly note cannot
possess another Monopoly note, so I don't think a VT can possess
another VT.  Plato cannot possess poker chips, so I don't think he
can possess VTs either.

There is judicial precedent for this, by the way, apart from Michael's
Judgement in CFJ 1063. I have elucidated these principles before, in
my Appeal Judgement in CFJ 911. I wrote there:

      However, my own preference (and it seems in this case that I
      have little else to guide me), is for the Poker Chip view,
      which understands a Mark, or any unit of Currency, on the
      metaphor of a poker chip.  This seem to me to be appropriate,
      especially considering Agora's origins as a face-to-face game,
      to be played around a table, just like Monopoly. In all such
      games where money is used, physical tokens are used to
      represent it. 

It's easy to see how this thinking continues to guide me in my 
understanding of the concept of 'posession' in Agora.
