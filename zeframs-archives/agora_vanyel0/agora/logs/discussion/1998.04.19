Few players would be reluctant to spend votes that you promise to give
them, unless you are so untrustworthy. It doesn't take much to suggest to
another player that you would give em a VT if e votes for your prop. If
the proposal is uncontraversial, few players would be so ungenerous as to
knock you back. If no-one else will, ask me. I will happily spend your 
VTs to vote for your proposals, at no extra charge.

Talking about which... I believe someone owes me some VTs. Steve?
