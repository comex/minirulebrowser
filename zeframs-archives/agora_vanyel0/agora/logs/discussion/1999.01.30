But there's nothing to stop it being used to make major changes to the
Ruleset, as long as no-one Objects to them. As such it has radical
implications.

Alright, so it's there. That only means there are two ways to interpret
the Rule. Who's to say that yours isn't the right one? No doubt Scott is
right about how the phrase would be interpreted in any American court.
But Agora's courts are not American, and weirdness and mischief may have
just as much a role to play here as justice...

Unless you (for some reason) wanted to use the ROM to repeal rules that, 
you yourself didn't want to repeal in your own proposals.  I don't know 
why any body would want to do this with the rules as they are.  However 
it is still possible.  (Not that I think you did.)

What if the bar height is raised so high only 1 or 2 people could get 
proposals distributed?  (Not likely but possible).

This might not be needed and it isn't exciting but, I thought I would 
post it anyhow.

Protoposal  How to announce presence

The paragraph in rule 1715 which reads

A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election or 
Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote Collector of 
this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

Is now amended to read.

A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election or 
Referendum.  To do this e sends a message to that effect to a public 
forum, such that the Vote Collector of this Proposal, Election or 
Referendum recieves the message.

There's a general rule in most criminal systems that volitional acts

But in conceding that the ambiguity is there, I concede that either
interpretation is reasonable.  As I don't have any strong preference
for one or the other, I'm not going to CFJ.

Probably just as well.  As I explained earlier, there appear to be no
compelling arguments on one side or the other; the decision comes down
to a policy question, and policy questions are better decided by
Proposal, not by Judgement.

We can forward all sorts of outlandish theories, but I think it would
be your burden to produce some credible evidence in support of that
theory before we allowed it to enter into the scope of judicial
review. :)

I never claimed that I am not occasionally radical.  I merely
disclaimed having any concrete long-term goals.

But you might not know it was insulting?  As whether or not the spoken

Oh well.....

I would suggest that Rule 1630 is not entirely in the correct
category.

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

When a Judge Orders that an action be Rescinded, that action is
considered to have never taken place, and all legal consequences of

A Judge shall Order an action Rescinded only when specifically
authorized to do so by the Rules.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1528 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization is a fictitious person created by or

      (b) Only those fictitious persons which these rules have created
          or recognized are Organizations.

      (c) Each Organization must have:
        (1) a Name, unique from that of every other Organization;
        (2) an Agent; and
        (3) a Charter.
          Any Organization which ceases to have each of the items
          listed above is subject to administrative dissolution, as
          defined elsewhere.  No Organization shall be created or
          recognized which does not have each of the items listed
          above.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) In a conflict between the Bylaws and the Charter of an
          Organization, the Charter takes precedence.

      (b) In a conflict between the Bylaws or the Charter of an
          Organization and the Rules, the Rules take precedence.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1614 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the
          Notary, which must set forth the Organization's old and new
          names.  The new name must be distinct from that of every
          other existing Organization.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Name may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1612 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization's name shall only be changed when its Agent
          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Charter to the
          Notary.

      (b) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter shall set forth
          its current name and its new Charter.

      (c) A Notice of Change of Organizational Charter may be
          rescinded by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue
          when the Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and
          Bylaws of the Organization in question.

      (d) In any CFJ alleging that the Charter of an Organization has
          been changed improperly, the Judge shall consider the
          Charter as it existed prior to the Change.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1531 be amended to read:

      (a) The Agent of an Organization must be a natural person.

      (b) The Agent of an Organization is required to abide by the
          Charter and Bylaws (if any) of that Organization.

      (c) An Organization's Executor is its Agent, if its Agent is a
          Player; otherwise, it has no Executor.

      (d) An Organization's Agent shall only be changed by
        (1) the delivery, by its current Agent, of a Notice of Change
            of Organizational Agent to the Notary, setting forth the
            current name of the Organization and its new Agent;
        (2) by the Notary, Without Objection; or
        (3) by Judicial Order, when the Rules permit such an Order to
            issue.

      (e) No person shall be made the Agent of an Organization without
          eir consent.  Any person who submits a Notice of Change of
          Organizational Agent certifies under penalty of
          Falsification that the new Agent consents.

      (f) A Notice of Change of Organizational Agent may be rescinded
          by Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question, or when the new Agent does not
          in fact consent.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1759 be amended to read:

      The Executor of an Organization may execute Payment Orders, as
      permitted by its Charter and Bylaws, but only those Payment
      Orders which name either the Organization itself or any Member
      thereof as payor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1533 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization may be created by the Execution of an
          Application to Create an Organization.

      (b) An Application to Create an Organization must, in order to

        (2) the identity of its initial Agent; and
        (3) the text of the Organization's initial Charter.

      (c) An Application to Create an Organization is Executed by
          submitting it to the Notary, and such Execution creates the
          Organization so described if the Application is valid.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1397 be amended to read:

      (a) An Organization shall be subject to dissolution when:
        (1) it ceases to have any of the items required of an
            Organization by the Rules; or
        (2) its Agent is not a Player and is not in close
            communication with anyone who is a Player.

          dissolution, as long as e has, not less than seven nor more
          than fourteen days prior, announced eir intent to dissolve
          the Organization as set forth in subdivision (b) of this
          Rule.

      (d) An Organization is dissolved when:

            Organizational Dissolution, setting forth the current name
            of the Organization to be dissolved; or

          created by these Rules; in any case, a dissolved
          Organization ceases to be recognized by these Rules as a
          legal person.

      (f) A Notice of Organizational Dissolution may be rescinded by
          Judicial Order; such Order shall properly issue when the
          Notice was delivered contrary to the Charter and Bylaws of
          the Organization in question. The Judge shall consider the
          last Charter and Bylaws of the Organization in making this

            a Group.

      (b) The above notwithstanding, an Organization shall be a Group

            Members who are Players.

      (b) A Group casts its Votes by its Agent.

          them.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 718 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1446 and 1539 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1500, 1588, 1595, 1591, 1594, 1457,

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1643 be amended to read:

      (a) A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
          the following requirements:
        (1) it has been posted to the Public Forum;
        (2) it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of
            Policy";
        (3) it specifies, by name, an Office to which it pertains; and
        (4) that Office is held by its author.

      (b) Once posted in accordance with subdivision (a) of this Rule,
          a Statement of Policy is binding upon the Player who issued
          it for as long as it remains in force.

      (c) An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
          Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.
          Further, any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever
          the Office it pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it
          constrains.

      (d) Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of
          Policy, a Class 2 Crime.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      (a) A Will is a document.

      (b) A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
          belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
          its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when
          that entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
          executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
          submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will
          (excepting those which e cannot execute or cannot execute
          successfully, for whatever reason), and will then divide the
          remaining residual assets as provided by the Will.

      (c) A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an
          Application to Create a Will.  Such an Application must
          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule are deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule are deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.
| 
|     (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
|         it conflicts.

          belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
          its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when
          that entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is

          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
|         Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be
          those Players who were within the Jurisdiction of its former
          SLC.

      (b) This Rule in no way prevents the change of any of the
          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

Unlimited Voting

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.
