Note that you should then be prepared to annotate all further VT Reports
with the above conditional Rule so that you or a successor can perform
the required bookkeeping at a later time when Goldbach's Conjecture is 
finally proven, if it ever is. ;)

Actually, I just intend to keep a copy of the message, which will be passed
along to future Accountors as part of the relevant information they need, along
with a reminder that they have to keep an eye out for someone providing them
with the proof.  8)

Someone correct me if I am wrong, but I think the point is that if the
conjecture is false, then it is provably false - one simply has to provide the
counter-example, which can be done in a finite, if incredibly large, amount of
time, and which can be shown in a finite amount of time that it is *not* the
sum of two odd primes.  So, if the conjecture is unprovably false, then there
is no such counter-example, which means the conjecture must be true.

I also think that this has generally been considered part of the perview
of 116.  In a completl pragmatic ruleset, you'd probably be right-- but
we are far from a completly paragmatic ruleset.  Also, I am beginning to
doubt that a completly pragmatic ruleset is a good ting.

Well, mathematically I am a many-worlds platonist.  Which means that
constructionism and intuitionism are just fine, as long as they stay
within their (platonically existent, of course) Kripke models where they
belong.

Well, due to my limited means I am not fond of the idea of increasing VT
expenditure, so if that's the only reason to get rid of Presence, I'll not
be voting on P3756.

Secret Voting seems interesting.  I'd be willing to vote for it if someone
will  pay the VT otherwise, I'll just declare Presence.

Electioneering.... I'd be interested in see this in action.

You could, however, argue that conditional votes in which the truth
value of the condition is not known to the Assessor do not inform em
in that way. If I say "I for for proposal P, iff Goldbach's Conjecture
is true", then Steve has not really been informed as to whether I vote
or not. My vote would not be made until I inform Steve whether or not
GC is true.
