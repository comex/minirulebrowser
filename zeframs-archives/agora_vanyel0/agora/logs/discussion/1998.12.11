Actually, that was mainly Scott's objection.  The D/E model, which
I'm supporting, gives a _de facto_ VP of 7.1 days just like Andre's
model.  It differs from Andre's model only on the academic question
of when the _de jure_ VP is.

Then it's the Rule set that is wacky, because R693 makes no distinction
between Proposals that are pending and those whose results have
already been published.

Notice that you have to use the past tense here, which is precisely my point.
Of course, the only answer you want is the historical one that had legal
significance at the time.  But that shouldn't blind you to the fact that there
may be a different answer to the question depending on which historical
dates you are talking about.

Well, we'll have to agree to disagree about what is sensible here, then.
I just don't see the beginning and end of a VP as events.  They are only
dates designated by the Rules to have certain legal significance.  IMO,
if you take the view that they are events, then you are forced to take the
position that the end of the VPs for P3810-3812 is an event which never
occurred, since R108 prevents Rules changes from causing retroactive
events, allowing us indefinite time to vote on them.  This, to me, is a much
less sensible view.

Well, it's clear that this proposal was legally submitted.  I would say that
Blob has done everything required of em by R1753 except send the
required message to the PF.  I note that R1753 puts time constraints
on when the selections must be made, but not on when the message
must be sent.  IMO, all Blob needs to do now is send the message
and all requirements will be legally fulfilled.

This is not in the format specified by Rule 1753.  Now what happens?
