True, but why should anyone have to go through such machinations?  Make a
trivial proposal, spend one of your own votes, and be done with it.

That's a shame. I personally thought Spring Cleaning was a worthy Proposal,
and would happily have supported it with a VT of my own. If just one other
person feels similarly, would you consider resuming your work on it?

Why not declaring Presence?

I don't quite see the peculiarity. I would interpret these provisions
taken together to imply that a Player does not have a Score while e
is deregistered, but that e resumes with eir old Score upon reregistering.
(R1432 is relevant here.)

Because the machinations are interesting! And because they encourage VT
expenditure.
