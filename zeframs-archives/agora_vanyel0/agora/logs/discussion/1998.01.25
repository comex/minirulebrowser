  Honorable Wizard,
   Shouldn't the three new players be listed here?  After all:

Rule 1543/7 (Power=1)
The Wizard

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
