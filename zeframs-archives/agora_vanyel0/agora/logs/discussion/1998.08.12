This is really my only objection to AgoraMOO. I think it would be 
a relatively long time before it produces any interesting results. 
We can short-cut this, by going directly to an exising MUD, like SW,
at the cost of having to put up with their design.

I won't be very interested in participating until it is reasonably
complex.

I would prefer to participate in Economic & Political affairs only,
but to attract members of the public, RPG is probably warranted.

I'd rather the physics be pre-determined, and not likely to change
often. Definitely not under the proviso of the rules.

Any or all of these things might be influenced, directly or 
indirectly, by actions on the MUD. Not that I think that they 
should necessarily be "reified" - I just mean that we could
possibly have rules which say "If a player does X on the MUD,
the Accountor shall pay out N VTs to em." Or whatever.

> Who should have to play in the MUD...
> Only those who want to?

Only those who want to. We might have certain Officers whose
responsibilities require them to take part. That's part of
the job of taking on the Office.

> Should the MUD attract non-Agorans? If so, how?

Yes. By whatever means would attract players to the MUD. Probably
RPG.

How so, since we have huge amounts of game custom to the effect that
sending a message to the PF is *equivalent* to sending it to all
Players, or indeed to any particular Player ? In a very real sense
agora-business@etc. is (from the Agoran point of view, of course) a
valid address for Steve or Morendil, to the same extent that our
normal email addresses are.

I am only appealing to the technical notion of relays because it is
only in such a technical sense that the mailing lists that constitute
the PF are an intermediary step. But then, if we consider technical
meaning at all, "directly" becomes impossible to interpret
consistently, because of the nature of Internet email.

There are a number of addresses to which any message sent eventually
reaches me. These include :
 - morendil@micronet.fr
 - agora-discussion@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
 - agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
 - frc@troll.no
 - laurent@netdive.com
 - cto@netdive.com
 - etc...

I could legally ask the Registrar to change my email address to any
of these, since all satisfy the essential criterion that any email
sent there will reach me. Without a priori knowledge of which
of the above is my 'actual' address, how can you determine which
is the most "direct" way of sending a message to me ?

Probably not.

I've thought about it. We should have physics that are essentially
RPG-oriented, and above all 'sensible'. If you want to go somewhere,
you have to walk; no teleportation, unless some device is involved.
(The question of what kind of device - magic orb, teleport booth,
whatever - is more an issue of what setting we'll want to adopt,
medieval, futuristic, or something else.) No 'shouting' from room
to room unless you have a means of communication, etc.

Right now, I sell dice, magic 8 balls ( lots of fun at Moo parties) and
I also do custom objects.  What would you like?

You mean you've heard that the Gods always follow the letter of the
rules, no matter what?  Are Gods punished for breaking the rules and
bounties put on their heads?

What I've heard is that some of the gods and wizzes are registered
citizens. They are therefore subject to the laws of the land, whether
they choose to obey them or not. I haven't been there long enough
to know whether any have been punished for breaking a law.

That's exactly what I have in mind. It ismuch easier than to set up
reified currencies within the MOO. If we couple any MOO currencies to
the Agora ones, we have the problem of enfording consistency between
currency holdings here and there. If we create new currencies in the
MOO, it will take ages to make them scarce and valuable enough - it
took ages in Agora, too.

Why not just let someone's currency holding in the MOO be convertible
to the equivalent currency in Agora?  This makes it harder to know
what holdings are, but is plausible (in the way that in the real
world, people have both cash and bank accounts).

Right.  But from what Steve has been saying, it's clear that the Gods
are allowed (by force of having the requisite power) to ignore any
rules that they like.  I personally can't see the point in being a God
and taking part in democratic politics, but hey, whatever cooks their
goose.  

In any case, it's clear simply from the way the world is, that the
Gods have to be above the law.  The Gods made the world in the first
place, and are in some sense outside it.  What they created, and still
have ultimate power over can hardly compel them, even if they do go
through the motions of signing up to be registered citizens as some
sort of inscrutable game.  (I suspect some sort of Lovecraftian plot
to blow the Mortals' minds :-)

Contrast this with the situation wrt to AgoraMOO where our ruleset
here and now has effective power over the "Gods" because a Player is
the Engineer, and the AgoraMOO was set up subsidiary to Agora.  Our
ruleset is outside AgoraMOO, so it can quite readily seek to control
its Gods.  The Sanom City ruleset is within SW, so it can hardly seek
to control those that are outside the world.

I'm not sure I see the point of this discussion anyway.  Even if one
can somehow see the SW and AgoraMOO Muds as logically equivalent in
their relationship to Agora (and I still think they are different),
this does not mean they are pragmatically equivalent.  For all that's
been said and done, SW has players, an economy and a physics.
AgoraMOO has none of these things, and will require an enormous amount
of work to get them. 

If we really do want to get our ruleset embodied in a real world, I am
not keen to have to wait ages for a real world to be slowly built in
AgoraMOO.  Why not just grab the SW opportunity? 

(Given that Morendil, lee and I seem to be the only people debating
this at the moment, perhaps the whole issue is a dead duck anyway..)

Michael.

Because a) it makes it much, much harder - among other things it means
that recordkeepors must participate in the MOO and be notified of all

Sure, we have to modify our system to allow for cash inputs.  I don't
see that recordkeepors need to be in the Mud at all though.
Presumably the Mud implementation could be set up to e-mail them when
deposits and withdrawals were made.  They certainly wouldn't need to
track cash transactions.

Yes possibly.  But it's precisely this sort of thing that makes the
exercise interesting, right?   Maybe I'm being too enthusiastic and we
should be more restrained...

Hmm, we could enact a Rule : when a Player transfers 5 VT to the Bank
for the purpose of buying MOObucks, the MOOaccountor shall, ASAP, 
give 5 MOObucks to the MOO character specified by that Player.

In fact, we don't even need a rule for that. Any player could set up a
MOO trust (on the basis of a closed contest, e.g.) that accepts Agora
currencies and keeps them, giving the corresponding amount of some MOO
tokens to the player who made the deposit. Anyone giving tokens back
to the trust manager in the MOO would then be reimbursed within Agora.

Doing this on the basis of private enterprises might trigger
interesting competition between different ways to code/reify
correncies in the MOO and make them safe against forgery, etc.

Consider also the case of Harlequin, whose official address is a
forwarding (and somewhat unreliably, as we have seen) one.

Maybe the rest of us are sleeping?  

I strongly agree with Michael; if we are to venture forth in this
nature, I think it should be done on Shattered World.  AgoraMOO just
isn't there yet and won't be for many years, despite the dedicated
efforts of those presently working on it.

I remind Players that after a brief hiatus of about 6 hours, Secret
Voting is back in force for another 2 months, until Monday, October 12.

The ban on Presence has, however, been lifted, at least for the moment.

I spent some time today on Shattered World talking to some of the local
deities and other citizens. My particular interest was in getting
information about who owns what in Merenth, so that we'd know who to
speak to.

We already knew that Delgath owns property in Merenth. It turns out that
4 other characters also own property there. I spoke to one of the
owners, Nikki (actually, the property in question is actually owned by a
secondary character of hers, adriana.) Geoff/Dredd was also present.

The upshot of the conversation was that Nikki is happy that we are
coming and is prepared to vacate her property in Merenth if she is
suitably compensated. I think the compensation will probably take the
form of property in Sanom City of equal or superior value to that being
traded away. Geoff is willing to arrange this.

My feeling so far from talking to residents of SW is that they're
curious about us and enthusiastic about the possibilities. Nikki was
worried that we're all such master Machiavellian manipulators that we'll
be running the place in no time! :) I wish that were true!

Assuming that we can get the details sorted out in the next few days,
how many of us are there who are prepared to give this a go and form
part of the SW colony? I think Scott, Blob, Michael and I are all
committed to the SW experiment. Is that right? Morendil seems to be
spending a lot of time on SW, doing quests and buildling up his stats
and personal wealth (watch out!). But since Morendil is the also the
creator of AgoraMOO, not to mention a charming yet enigmatic francais, I
am not sure what this says about his intentions. (Morendil?) Lee and
Macross seem to be committed exclusively to AgoraMOO. What about the
others?

Like to know what I'm up against. Now I feel that I'm more qualified

Not quite optimal. When I'm on a 'binge' I sleep one long night every 
three days.

If you lost something in the dark, you would probably be searching
for it where there is light, on the principle that there at least you
can see better. :)

Shattered is very nice for determining what would be nice to have
in AMoo, and what mistakes (a lot) made in SW should be avoided
there. And I'm making sure I build up a character so that when some
Agorans come there I can lord it over them. :)

Does this means that you're *not* interested in being a colonist?
That would be a shame. What a fine Agoran ambassador (small 'a') you
would make!

After all, since you don't sleep (much), surely you have time to hold
down a full-time job, read all your Agora and other mail, conduct
labyrinthine arguments with me on obscure points of law, start your own
MOO and complexify it *and* play Shattered World? 

You're not married, are you, Morendil?

Re: DIS: The World Of Agora

It really seems like its time to stop arguing over whether to use SW or build
AgoraMOO.  There seem to be enough Players in both camps who are interested
enough so that we can venture forth on both fronts.  It may be a while before I
can participate in either MUD, but I'd enjoy participating in Agora legislation
regarding them now.  Let's get started.

I should point out that my take on "directly" in the rule in question
is to distinguish Private Orders from Judicial and Appelate Orders,
which are executed indirectly by submission to the Clerk of the
Courts.  It may be enlightening to keep this in mind.

Not before law or church, but I enjoy the company of a significant 
person of the opposite sex and a child of two, to become an older
brother in a handful of months. But they've been away on vacation
these recent days. :)

I don't think it makes sense to interpret "directly" as "privately",
for the simple reason that they are quite different terms. Let's
amend the Rule to say "privately", or remove the word altogether,
rather than try to fit square pegs into round holes.

As it happens, cto is an alias, not a list. But it illustrates my 
point perfectly - how would you, or anyone, be expected to
know that ? What basis is there in the Rules for distinguishing
between an ISP-provided email address and a mailing list ? As
long as both are a way of reaching me, as far as I can tell, the
Rules are satisfied.

> If you took the unusual step of informing the Registrar that your

So ? Again, the Rules make no such requirement. They only insist on
my providing a preferred email address to the Registrar. They do not
even formulate that as a requirement to have an email account or
address, they merely state that the Registrar shall not be
responsible for messages sent to an outdated email address.

Suppose a friend of mine wanted to play Agora. He doesn't have an
email address, an Internet connection, a PC of his own, doesn't
speak english... I maintain that e would still be able to play, if he
went to the trouble of phoning me to keep up on recent news, and
sending any messages required of em via temporary, write-only email
addresses created on the fly in some cybercaf. E would still be 
abiding by all the requirements of the Rules.

> and in the second place, the Registrar, and anyone who might want
> to send you a message directly, would be entitled to ask which
> address you had informed majordomo@gecko was your email address. 

What business would that be of theirs ? More to the point, where do
the Rules require that I provide such an address upon request ?

I'm well aware that I'm exaggerating more than a little in the above,
but it is in the nature of a reductio ad absurdum.

To sum up - the Rules do not regulate email addresses, but transfer
of information. (We could transplant the Ruleset to a non-Internet
based LAN or WAN and not have to change one word of it.) In that
context, any argument for the interpretation of "directly" which 
relies on some properties of Internet email is IMHO vacuuous.

As in, 'submitted to the person to which the Order is directed' vs.
'submitted to an entity other than that to which the Order is
directed'. Unsurprisingly, I find this more convincing. :)

Alright, I think that's enough for me to concede the argument. The
situation as it now appears to me following the tuition on the subject I
have received from Michael, Morendil and Scott, is that there were in
fact other possible interpretations of "direct" than that which lee
considered, with good claims to be reasonable interpretations of that
word in R1808. Hence lee should not have have found that the meaning of
the word was clear, and hence he should have considered game custom.

If the Board's decision is to overturn, I'll be supporting re-assignment
so that a new Judge can consider in full the arguments that have been
put forward during this debate.
