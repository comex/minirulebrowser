Tangentially, in case anyone is wondering why I've been so inactive, I
have a business venture in progress which is taking nearly all of my
time.  I don't guarantee that I'll have any more time in the fall,
either, since then begins my first year in Applied Nomic Studies, also
known as law school. :)

I bid 1 P-Note for 1 of those Indulgences if I'm in time to do so,
although I think I'm about a half-hour too late.

You're OK actually.  I did specify +0000 as the time-zone so you're
half an hour early.  With three bids at the same value, I think the
best thing to do (assuming you still want to buy) is to sell a 3rd
Indulgence. 

So, if you, Kolja and Blob each transfer a P-Note to me, then I will
transfer an Indulgence back in return. 

Michael.

Actually, I'm going to welch on the deal. Thanx to the lottery, I
have more than enough Indulgences to pay off my debt, and I don't want
to part with more P-Notes than I need to. So thankyou Michael, but
no sale.

I've offered to trade them for Indulgences, but have not yet had
any takers.  Surely you don't mean to suggest that all I can do
with my VTs is vote?  We did want an economy, with trade and
everything, right?

It is a natural and wise decision to save as much as possible in a VT scarce
environment, especially when there is a push to limit VT sources even more.

In my opinion, reluctance to part with VTs will always increase in the face
of increased scarcity.  In real life economies this reluctance to spend
tends to be limited by the fact that people must spend some minimal amount
just to survive.  In Agora, however one can hoard VTs forever if one is so
inclined.

(Sub-)PROTO: Exercise your Rights, or Lose Them.

Create a rule with title "Use it or lose it" and text:

      At the beginning of each month, the Assessor may deny voting privileges
      to any Player who did not vote on any proposals during the previous
      month, for a period of time, up to 3 weeks.

Amend rule 879 to read:

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players who have not been 
      denied Voting Privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, 
      whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, their Hold statuses (On or Off), and their
      Voting Privileges at the beginning of the prescribed Voting
      Period for that Proposal.

[Comments: Okay, so the first part isn't that serious, but the 
 amendment to 879 might be worthwhile.]

Too soon.  The Bank has not paid out its obligations yet, so you don't have a
P-Note to transfer yet.

ProtoProposal Chuck119.1
Some Omnibus-Reform Related Fixes

[General comment: This Proto combines Protos Chuck115-Chuck118.]

I request that this Proposal have AI=1.


Rule 789 ("Orders to Annotate Rules") is amended by changing the
text which currently reads:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed, or when required to do so by a valid Order.

to read:

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that
      Rule is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order;
      or if the original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or
      vacated.  The Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate
      a Rule Without Objection.

Rule 1500 ("Orders to Annotate SLCs") is amended by changing the
text which currently reads:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      when the SLC ceases to exist, or when required to do so by a
      valid Order.

to read:

      The Maintainer of that SLC may remove such an annotation only
      if the SLC ceases to exist; if required to do so by a valid
      Order; or if the original Order to Annotate is amended, stayed,
      or vacated.  The Maintainer of an SLC may vacate an Order to
      annotate that SLC Without Objection.

[Comments: The OR amendment got rid of the list of Relevant Rules,
which means that if an interpretation is critically dependent on
a Rule other than the one being annotated, it may persist after
that Rule is amended, even if it should not.  Allowing the
annotation to be removed Without Objection will allow such
annotations to be removed without a court order.

Also clarifies that if an order to annotation is amended, stayed,
or vacated, the Rulekeepor/Maintainer need not continue to
supply the original annotation.]


Rule 1829 ("Refusal of Duty by the Speaker") is amended to read:

      If the Speaker is convicted of the Crime of Contempt by
      Inaction, relating to a validly issued Order to Compel which was
      directed at the position of Speaker, the Speaker becomes
      Tainted.

[Comments: Despite what R1829 currently says, an Impossible
Speaker is *not* defined elsewhere.  This corrects that.  Also,
it limits the relevant orders to compel to those incurred *as
Speaker*--the current version of 1829 would allow penalties
against the Speaker for orders to compel which applied to
the Speaker, but were not directed to the position of Speaker.]


Rule 1795 ("Timing Requirements of Orders") is amended by
changing the text which currently reads:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or if the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, the Order shall be taken to require the performance of
      the action as soon as possible after the Order takes effect.

to read:

      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

[Comments: Sets a minimum of 3 days to perform any action required
by Order.  Also allows a reasonble time for new Office-holders
to satisfy requirements of Orders.]


Rule 1814 ("Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions")
is amended by appending a sentence which reads:

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which specifies
      a different penalty for a Crime or Infraction.

[Comments: Rule 1814 tries to specify that the penalty for
a Crime or Infraction is the one that applied at the time
the Crime or Infraction was committed, but lacks the necessary
precedence clause to make it work as intended.]


Rule 1798 ("I Was Only Obeying Orders") is amended to read:

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid shall not be convicted of a Crime, nor
      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause
      the Player to be convicted of a Crime or penalized, as
      described, for said action.

[Comments: Clarifies what 1798 currently means by "is not liable
for".  Adds a necessary precedence clause.]

Good luck!

Come to think of it, perhaps I should be wishing *them* good luck! :)

Of course. And I certainly wasn't suggesting that *all* you can do
with your VTs is vote. But your answer is a little disingenuous,
Chuck - you've only voted on 3 Proposals in the last 3 months.

OK, here goes. I have already sketched in a number of posts last
week the political problems I think the Cartographor will be faced
with once e is given control over the productivity of Plots (and
when are we going to see a Proposal to achieve this?) I think 
actually being the Cartographor will be the most interesting 
position to be in once the pressures start to build, so that's
why I've nominated for Cartographor.

If elected, and assuming I have control of Plot productivity, my
policy will be to set the level of that productivity so that (1)
Officers are at a significant relative advantage to Plotholders,
(2) the VT part of the economy remains in balance, and (3) Plots
are still attractive to non-Officers as an alternative to the
unemployment benefit.

If I recall correctly, you recently (and successfully) lobbied
the Chancellor to lower the BOS.  One of the arguments you gave
was that you would consider it dereliction of duty on the part
of the Chancellor if the Accountor had to levy a VT tax.  From
this I infer that you prefer regulating the BOS rather than
levying a tax as a method of regulating VTs.

If you dislike VT hoarding, shouldn't the opposite be the case?

But as to the question at hand, I am currently seeking to buy
up to 9 Indulgences, at 1VT each.  But at the moment, I only
have 8.8 VTs!  Voting at this point will only make it that much
harder to pay off my Indulgence debt.

Chuck
