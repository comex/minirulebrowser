Ah, sod it. I can't afford the time to continue to be Accountor. 
Promotor is not too much trouble, as the number of transacations is
fairly small, but Accountor is just beyond my abilities.

I make an offer: I'll delegate the Office of Accountor to anyone who
is willing, and I will donate two weeks of salary to cover for the
backlog of transactions that need to be done.

If no-one takes me up on this, I'm afraid I'll have to resign and 
let the Speaker handle the job. Sorry Steve.

If you resign just before the end of the week without having produced
a report, the person taking over the job will have to do it in the
time remaining.  I recommend either producing the report, or waiting
until next week as I think it pretty dishonorable to suddenly dump
work on the Speaker (or someone else, if they are foolish enough to
take it on) in this way.  Steve has already paid for Failure to
Produce a Report in this way due to being dropped into the
Scorekeepor's job when Swann quit. 

Michael.

Re: DIS: Re: OFF: election results

Sigh.  I was really looking forward to spending less time bookeeping and I
would really appreciate it if someone else were to volunteer for the Accountor
position.  However, if no one is willing, I hate to see Steve get stuck with it
by default - especially when I already have my own software that works (sort
of).  Anyway, if no one else is willing, I will take Blob up on the offer
below.

If I am to be Accountor, please send Accountor related stuff to
