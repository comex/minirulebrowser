A similar idea: allow Locations to own Currencies (should be
Commodities, but we're not there yet).  Structures dump their output
into and draw inputs from their Location.  No inputs, no production.
You pay for a Structure's "Upkeep" by depositing sufficient Ergs in
its Location.

>  3.1: How do I vote?

As of Jan. 1998, all voting on Proposals, Elections and Referenda
must be done in public, ie by sending a message to the Public Forum
during the Voting Period. The message should specify what you're voting
on, and how you are voting.
[cf. 1764]

>   +3.1.2: Voting Token, what's that?

Voting Tokens are a Currency, the primary use of which is to vote on
Proposals. Each vote you cast on a Proposal costs you one Voting
Token, which you will be billed by the Assessor after the end of the
Voting Period. [This assumes that P3693 will pass.]
[cf. 1442]

>   +3.1.3: This is a democracy, but voting isn't free?

The best things in life may be free, but the best things in Agora
are not. Or at least, they aren't any more. For about the first
two years of the game, until March 1995, voting was completely
free. For about two years after that, Players' first votes were
free, and Players had the option to cast a second vote, at the
expense of a Voting Token, which at the time were called Extra
Votes. A desire to make Extra Votes more valuable led to the
removal of the right to cast a free first vote, in April 1997,
at which time Extra Votes were renamed Voting Tokens.
[cf. 1442, especially the History]

>   +3.1.4: Then what's Presence?  Isn't that a vote?

Technically, no, Presence is not a vote. It doesn't cost you
a Voting Token to declare your Presence on a Proposal. 
Declaring Presence is just like abstaining on a Proposal,
while counting towards Quorum. Since the cheapest way to get
a Proposal to fail is to get it to fail Quorum, declaring
Presence has the effect of expressing very mild support for
a Proposal; mild opposition would be expressed by not voting
or declaring Presence on it at all.
[cf. 1715]

>   +3.1.5: How do I get a Voting Token then?

This is always a major focus of legislative activity, so any answer
given here is unlikely to remain up to date for long. At time of
writing, the most common way of earning VTs is to hold one of the
Offices which pays a weekly Salary [cf. 1007]. Making a Proposal
which gets adopted will earn you 2 VTs [cf. 833]. Judges also earn
a salary for delivering Judgement [cf. 591].

>   +3.1.6: I can't vote on anything without a Voting Token?

[Once again, assuming P3693 passes.]
It's not quite that simple. First of all, voting on Referenda and
in Elections remains completely free. Secondly, it is possible to
vote on Proposals without Voting Tokens. However, you will then
have to find a way to pay the Voting Token bills that voting on
Proposals will cause you to incur. If you cannot do so, the 
penalties may be severe.
[cf. 1442, 1713]

What do people think about this?  In an election like the forthcoming
one for Justiciar there are five candidates, and assuming that all of
them attract some support, there will be a large number of wasted
votes.

A standard fix for this sort of problem is to use a preferential
voting system where Voters rank the Candidates in order of preference,
and then if after the all the first choice votes have been tallied
no-one has a majority, the candidate with the least number of votes is
dropped and all of their votes are redistributed to second choice
candidates.  &c &c.  I understand that this is how Australian
elections to their lower hourse work.

However, for all that this might give us a more rational system (and
beware: what do you do if A gets five votes and B and C both get 3?),
it will also make voting in Elections less strategically interesting.
At a national level, where these things are (perhaps :-) more
important, I'd be the first to campaign for a more rational system
(having to vote strategically (i.e. counter-intuitively) to get a
desired result seems a pretty good indication that a system needs
reform), but perhaps this sort of thing makes Agora more interesting. 

Michael.

PS: preference voting as practised in Australia does not produce
proportional results on a party basis in the legislature, which is
probably why the big parties in the UK are so keen on it as a possible
reform of the existing system.  For proportionality you need
multi-member constituencies and the Single Transferable Vote system
(as in the Republic of Ireland), or you need a system that allows
people to vote for parties directly and which then adjusts the
legislature appropriately, as happens (with variations) in Germany,
Israel and New Zealand.

If I'd been really on the ball, I would have just retracted my
nomination, but my thoughts about voting systems etc came too late and
I'm in the Election for Justiciar.

However, in the interests of narrowing the field, I "retract" my
nomination, and urge everyone that was going to vote for me (anyone?
:-) to vote for Morendil instead.

Morendil was Speaker until the recent revolt, and is well-qualified to
serve on the Board of Appeals, being a Player of long-standing etc,
etc.  As Speaker in his last term he served at least once on the BoA,
and I'd like to see him continue in that position.

Michael.

I think that the election of Justitiar might become most interesting
just because we have the simple voting system we have. In fact, I
believe that the current elections are the first time I've really seen
the group structure used for something like party politics. For
example, if the Threat (four votes) all vote for Scott, and maybe buy
a few more votes, the only way for Scott to lose would be a
considerable degree of planning by all the other players, so they
don't split their votes and let Scott win.

This can be fun, and while I'd rather not see an all-Threat
government, I'd rather have some fun with these elections than a more
complicated election system that avoids these "problems".

I was thinking the French system (at least that's what we call it
here) of two ballots might be more interesting, not to mention a lot
less complicated.  If one candidate wins a majority on the first
ballot, e is elected.  Otherwise, a second vote is taken with just the
top two candidates from the first ballot, in a runoff election.  Only
problem is ties, but those can be dealt with.

As is it now, an Officer can be elected by a plurality, which makes
for odd dynamics when there are four or more candidates up for a
single Office.

Hi all,

Just an attempt to spice up the upcoming elections: here are some data
on Offices held, and incomes connected to these offices, sorted by
groups. 

Before the current elections, the situation looked like this (I'm
leaving out the paper tiger office of CinC, because it doesn't really
play any role at the moment and doesn't draw a salary, either).

Group      no of offices     sum of salaries

Threat      7 of 15 (47%)      9 VTs of 21 (43%)

Order       3 of 15 (20%)    4.5 VTs of 21 (21%)

X group     2 of 15 (13%)    2.5 VTs of 21 (12%)

none        3 of 15 (20%)      5 VTs of 21 (24%)


In the current elections most players have already cast their votes;
the only votes I have not seen yet are by three unaffiliated players
and one member of the Threat (elJefe). At the moment the elections for
CotC, Notary, Promotor and Wizard are close contests between members
of the Threat and the Order - exactly split votes at the moment, and I
guess elJefe's vote will help the Threat win them all... For
Scorekeepor Harlequin might win, because Swann attracted some votes,
including one from a member of the Threat. Morale: If the Threat votes
unanimously, they can win elections.

The same goes for the Justiciar election, which just began (the
non-Threat votes will be split among many other candidates), while the
elections for Archivist and Chancellor are between Threat members and
unaffiliated candidates. So the Threat can win these, too. Then we
have: 


Group      no of offices     sum of salaries

Threat      9 of 15 (60%)   11.5 VTs of 21 (55%)

Order       3 of 15 (20%)      5 VTs of 21 (24%)

X group     2 of 15 (13%)    2.5 VTs of 21 (12%)

none        1 of 15 (20%)      2 VTs of 21 ( 9%)


Bad times for independent candidates, good times for the
Threat... I wonder whether the last revolution really was but a lame
attempt to use the delegation loophole in the revolution
rules. Especially as offices are gaining more and more real political
power, and at the moment salaries are the only serious form of income.

Happy voting, Kolja A.

Before anyone else has to find this, here is a correction (I knew I'd
make some mistake counting all these offices, and of course it did
make things look eben worse for us non-Threat-people): even in my
all-for-Threat scenario there will be two offices held by unaffiliated
players, Chuck as rulekeepor and the Notary (Chuck or
Murphy). Probably I've assigned the Threat one office too many. Sorry!

Given that I'm the only member of the X group, you probably should
count me among the unaffiliated.  The picture you get then of the
situation becomes a little less extreme.

Why limit this to a single person? I think it would be better to try
to revive the thesis idea (as someone else remarked before). The
historian would then not be responsible for _writing_ Agora history,
but for collecting contributions from all players, archiving them,
maybe even reviewing/editing the material, and for handing out rewards
to those who contribute.

If only. Now that I've received the 10 VTs, I can promptly use them to pay
off the vacation PO from when my Win was appealed.

Seeing as you don't ever specify your name, and your e-mail address is
not the usual "Chaos Harlequin" but instead "linda hall", is it
possible to argue that you didn't cast those votes?

Wait, I didn't mean e-mail address.  I meant identity.  Sorry.

No.  All actions are taken by the person.  What name e uses is irrelevant.

To this I would add:

N.B.: Casting a Vote Against a Proposal may, paradoxically,
cause it to pass, by causing that Proposal to meet Quorum.
Keep a close eye on the voting to see if this is likely.

Proto: Meaningful Zeitgeist

Now that votes are scarce and Interest is free, the Zeitgeist title and awards
are not very meaningful - who wants to waste a vote to vote against a proposal
just to prevent a Zeitgeist award and only one vote FOR by the proposer and the
rest declarations of presence does not seem to me to be worthy of Zeitgeist.  I
suggest the following fix:

Amend Rule 1047 by replacing the text:

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

with the text:

      When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some Player is adopted
      with no votes cast AGAINST it and at least two Players other than
      the proposer voting FOR it, that Player is awarded the Patent
      Title of Zeitgeist.

I picked "two Players other than the proposer" to get back some of the original
meaning of Zeitgeist, overwhelming support by the Agoran community.  I'm open
to suggestion on this.  Anyone think it should be even harder?

I think it's less likely with Public Voting.

Consider the following: last year, the School of Library and
Information Studies (SLIS) here at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison decided to produce a T-shirt to sell to students in the
school.  There were about ten candidate slogans for the
T-shirt, and students were asked to vote for one.  However,
voting was essentially public: a sheet was posted with the
possible slogans, and students were asked to place a check
mark by the one preferred (we were on our honor to vote
only once).

Only two of the slogans got any votes at all.

I don't think it's because everyone wanted only one of these
two slogans.  Rather, it was obvious early in the voting
that one of these two would win, and so people chose
to cast their votes in a meaningful manner, for one of
those two.  (I don't remember what the slogans were, so
don't ask.)

I think such a system would be further enhanced if we
allowed people to change their votes during voting.
(Why isn't changing votes allowed during Referenda/Elections,
anyway?  This never made sense to me.)

You are of course free to transfer Kudos in any manner you see
fit, but I hardly think it's appropriate to blame me for
problems which lie in the handling of possibly-incorrect
POs/TOs.  I legitimately believed you had not won the

For the benefit of anyone who hasn't voted yet, if I am
elected Notary, Notary's Reports will be sent out as
regular text, and not as MIME-type messages.  (I suppose
this could be either good or bad, depending on your

Amend Rule 1712 by replacing the following text:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, if the total number of

      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in the

This will gradually bring Indulgence holdings back down to where they were
intended, with the possibility of that "hot-potato" Blot.  It is also
automatically self-adjusting when Players deregister while holding Blots or
Indulgences.

Because of time zone disadvantages? In potentially tricky situations

of the voting period would havee a considerable impact (and make

I'm not going to get involved in a Kudowar, but that does seem a little
unfair to Chuck. All he did was to pursue a matter of Rule interpretation
through the Courts, and I can see no dishonour in that. It is true and
unfortunate that this resulted in you getting shafted, but such things
will happen in a game designed by committee.

I can see your point; I'm annoyed enough at what's happened with my Win so
far; now that I've at least managed to escape further PI penalties, I found
it unneccesary and irritating for Chuck to once again appeal the judgement.
Perhaps this is a bit harsh, but I'm not going to change my mind.

That may be a good reason to keep indelible voting, but I'm pretty sure
that's not why we happen to have it for Referenda and Elections. I
doubt that the author of R1434 (Blob?) had any clear intentions in
using this system. I think it's just luck.

That's an interesting anecdote, Chuck. To me it demonstrates that
the current system magnifies random effects due to early voting.
If it had happened that supporters of some of the other slogans had
voted earlier, it may well have been two completely different
slogans that ended up getting all the votes.

In that light, it's interesting to think about the effect that
indelible voting has. It certainly makes an enormous difference to
the political process, just as public voting does. Once you've voted,
you've thrown all your negotiating power out the window. On the other
hand, early voting can be strategically crucial in persuading other
undecided voters that the candidate you support has a chance of
winning and that therefore their votes will not be wasted if they
also support your preferred candidate. Of course, the thing to do in
that case is announce your support for a certain candidate early on,
but withhold your vote until you have a clearer picture of what
others are going to do.

Moving to a system like the Proposal system where votes can be
changed would certainly be quite different. Negotiating about votes
would go on until the last minute, since someone might renege on
a deal they made with you if the price is right. Indelible voting
provides a public way of keeping one's promises.

Now, as between these two system, I don't have a strong preference.
They're both interesting in their own ways. But I do think it's
kind of neat that we're using one system for Proposals and the
other for Elections and Referenda (with the additional difference
of course that voting in Elections and Referenda is free). This
way, we get to explore both kinds of voting system at once!

There are two inaccuracies in the above: It is Swann and not I who is
involved in two 3-way races (for Scorekeepor and Wizard). But he does
does not have 3 votes in each: you have misrepresented General
Chaos' vote in the Wizard Election. The General voted for me and
not for Swann for Wizard. This means that the vote for Wizard is
tied 5-5.

Given that Jester, Time Agent and Oerjan have yet to vote and are
unaffiliated, surely it's more than possible that Threat candidates
could lose all these Elections. It's too early to be calling the
results just yet. Contra your moral, it's not enough for Threat
candidates, or the candidates of any Group for that matter, to
support themselves; they need to form alliances with other Players,
as the Order appears to have done with Murphy, for example.

I'd like to say how thrilled I am with how these Elections are
being conducted, no matter what the results. These are the most
intriguing and closely contested set of Elections I can ever recall
in the game, and I think that's reflected in the public interest in
them. 12 of 16 Players have already voted, and there's a good chance
that by the end of the Voting Periods, we will have seen every single
Player cast a vote, something which I do not believe has ever
happened before in the nearly three years we've been conducting
Elections for Offices. At least three Players have been keeping
personal tallies of the votes cast so far, and that information
is being disseminated and discussed by the Players. Pretty clearly,
Players are pursuing private strategies and negotiations. These are
very healthy signs that the game is really alive and holding the
interest of the Players. It's a good time to be playing Agora, and
I think we all know why: VT scarcity has made holding Office more
desirable than it ever has been before, and public voting has enabled
everyone to see how an Election is progressing while it is occurring,
which make the contests more interesting. It's nice to see that,
at least once in a while, policy can work out the way you hoped.

This seem fine to me. I'd be in favour of converting the award
back to VTs, though, say 2 of them.

Given that Morendil has supported non-Threat candidates in two
Elections (Promotor and Wizard), Threat candidates in three Elections
(Scorekeepor, CotC and CinC), but voted against the Threat-supported
candidate for Notary, I'd say he qualifies as an independent voter.

In the message in which you de-Kudoed me, you said nothing about
my latest call for appeal.  If *that* was the reason you transferred
a Kudo away from me, you should have said so.  Perhaps this is
a bit harsh, but I'm not going to change my mind.

I'm not sure I'm even going to propose this, but the times seem right
to at least be asking the question: is it time for...

####
Proto-Proposal
No Free Voting

[Comment: the logical conclusion of legislative trends which have
been operating for a number of years is the end of free voting
on Elections and Referenda.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1434 (Default Procedure for Referendum
Voting) be amneded by inserting in it, immediately after the
paragraph which begins "* Voting:", a new paragraph which reads:

      * Cost of Voting: as soon as possible after the end of the
      Voting Period, the Vote Collector shall bill each Player
      who cast a vote in the Referendum one Voting Token. In the
      case where a Player has voted in more than one Referendum,
      the results of which the Vote Collector has published at
      the same time, the Vote Collector is permitted to execute
      a single Payment Order for all the votes cast by that 
      Player in the Referenda, instead of billing em separately
      for each vote.

I would think that since holding Office is the primary means of gaining VT's
that charging for voting in Elections would give Office holders an undue
advantage.

I'm not really keen on moving to a preferential ballot, since the
present system is pretty interesting as it is, and preferential
ballots will be a lot more complicated to legislate. But are you
sure that voting in a preferential ballot would not be strategic?

Consider an example where A has 4 votes, and B and C each have
3 votes. Of B's supporters, 2 have A as their second preference,
while 1 has C; all of C's supporters have B as their second 
preference. Your have the last vote, and your own preferences are, in
order: A, B, C. How should you actually vote? Your strategic aim
has got to be to eliminate B so as to redistribute B's preferences.
So pretty clearly, you shouldn't put A first, despite preferring A,
because that would leave B and C tied, and the tie-breaking procedure
might well not be under your control. Obviously voting for B is a
disaster, since that will eliminate C and put B over the line. So,
despite C being your least preferred candidate, you should vote C,
A, B. This eliminates B, giving A two votes and putting A over the
line.

All very interesting, but we don't really have a fully fledged party 
political system in Agora yet, despite the Group activity in the current
Elections, (which I'm pleased to see, mind you). We could, of course,
legislate a party political system by allowing only parties to stand
for Office, which would force Players to join a party if they wanted
to hold Office. But somehow I don't think we're quite ready for that
yet...
