Modification, clarification, limitation: these are all perfectly
sensible things for one provision of a Rule to do to another. But
contradiction? "X is Y. X is not Y."? That's another thing entirely.

This is no longer true, now that Risky Rebellion has passed. If a 
revolt were called at the moment, there would be a 5/17 chance of
it succeeding.

BTW: I would still like to see those other Rebellion-related protos
proposed. I believe both Swann and Sherlock had interesting ideas.

Kolja,

It took me a while to get around to it, but I have read your thesis
submission, and I quite like it. I recommend that you include as an
appendix Steve's response (if he doesn't mind) in order to give a 
balanced perspective, and submit it for formal acceptance.

Ah thanks for reminding me of this.  I'd forgotten that Risky
Rebellion was passing through the system.

I know what I could do, if I were feeling nasty. I could rebel
and call for a revolt. It would probably fail, and all those other
Rebels would gain 2 Blots each. Wouldn't that be fun? Of course,
I'd get 4 Blots myself, so I'm not very likely to do that, am I?

Then again, I do have plenty of spare Indulgences lying around...
Hmmm... ;)

This is a little bit tricky, since we don't want to allow going On Hold to be
an easy way of avoiding debt penalties.  It can be done, but it will require a
bit more (error-prone) recordkeeping for the Currency Officers, to keep track
of periods of time when the obligation is tolled.

Why haven't we fixed the bug which allows Players On Hold to be
guilty of Persistent Indebtedness? We need to tweak the definition
of PI so that it's defined in terms of failure to fulfil a certain
kind of responsibility (which being On Hold would obviously relieve
one of), instead of being defined as meeting a certain condition,
as it is at the moment.

BUS: Proto: Reward for trustees

This is a good idea.  But I have an idea I have been kicking around to rewrite
the probate code and eliminate Trustees entirely - if I can just get the time
to work up a formal proto.  8)

What about rewarding trustees for their work? For example,

 amend Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans) by appending to the
 last paragraph the sentence 

As soon as possible after an entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate
the Notary shall pay out three VTs to the last trustee of that entity.

One could also argue that it's a feature - paying your debts before
you go on hold is only one of several things you have to clean up
before going on hold. You also need to delegate offices you don't want
to lose and judge CFJs (or reject them) in order to avoid unwanted
consequences of going on hold.

My feeling is that players who go On Hold should be liable for
infractions for orders issued prior to going On Hold, but not for
those issued while e was On Hold.

That seems like a reasonable principle.  In fact, I would
say it falls under the "commonsense" of R217.

I am unclear whether I have satisfied the requirements of R1738:

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

I announced a Plan to the Public Form, someone objected and so I
announced a second Plan, to which there was no objection.  By the
faulty wording of the rule, I believe my obligation is done: note that
after someone objects, the last sentence only requires them to
"formulate and announce a new plan as above...until there is no
objection."  Nothing in that sentence requires me to enact the Plan at
all.  ("The process" clearly indicates the process of announcing and
formulating a Plan, not the enactment of a Plan, in that it is said to
happen until there is no objection.)

I think you may be right, but the Infraction has been reported under the belief
that is was a correct report and therefore the obligation has been placed on
you.  A Claim of Error or a CFJ will be required to remove these Blots from
your record.  I'm not sure how Kolja feels about this, but other Players have
expressed, um, distaste for being forced to render legal decisions through
COEs.  It might be best to issue a CFJ alleging that no such Crime was
committed.

As a matter of fact, after a quick scan of the Rules, I think a CFJ may
actually be the *only* way to overturn an Infraction report.

I wouldn't mind vacating the penalty orders just based on a COE. In
the present case, while I am not sure that I accept Sherlocks
interpretation of the rule, the more important question is one of
facts which I missed (that Sherlock did publish plans and do
everything required of em, at least in eir opinion), not a
legal/judicial one.

I haven't seen a post-omnibus ruleset yet, but under the new omnibus
rules there is one that states that Orders can always be vacated by
the player who issued them. Unless this possibility is cancelled by
another provision that takes precedence over this explicit possibility
to vacate orders, I think there is no reason why I can't just vacate
the orders.

In fact, if Crito doesn't point out in more detail why e thinks I
can't vacate the POs for Sherlock, and as soon as Sherlock makes a
formal COE, I'll be happy to vacate the POs for Sherlock - I am not
trying to make players' lives harder or annoy people just for the heck
of it, I would just like to see the Probate Code regulations enforced
(instead of ignored, as we did so far). If these regulations are
broken and players use the holes in the Probate Code to avoid doing
their job, that's fine with me.

Ah, yes.  My quick scan was on a pre-Omnibus Ruleset too.  Looks like a COE is
fine.

Then I submit a formal COE, alleging that I have fulfilled the
requirements specified by the Probate Code and that I should not be
punished for them.  Thanks!

Modification, clarification, and limitation can all result in 
situations which appear to be contradictory: "X is three. This rule 
does not make X three." Aside from that, I agree that contradiction 
is different from those three. Fortunately, it almost never comes up.

Your example is not one of modification, clarification or limitation,
but one of contradiction, since the Rule manifestly *does* make X three,
or try to.

You might want to talk to elJefe. I seem to remember he had a proto
floating around to eliminate the Probate Code.

I don't think this final paragraph will be effective, as the original
Rebellion rule should take precedence. You probably need to explicitly
claim precedence.

The same goes for the rule for Churches in the Plots proto.

I suppose that's one way of looking at it. But, like Scott, I think we
should distinguish failure to pay debts incurred before going On Hold
from failure to pay debts incurred after going On Hold (such as debts
due to commission of PI Infractions), and punish On Hold Players only
for the former. In Scott's current case, that would mean he would be
required to pay the 1 Indulgence for the PI Infraction, but his
failure to do so while On Hold would not result in further commissions 
of the Infraction of PI.

[...]

The Rule "Threat Trombones", however, makes it clear that
Threat Trombones are created by the Threat Vizier--*not*
by the Rule "Threat Trombones" itself.  Thus, Threat Trombones
*are* subject to the provisions of the first paragraph of the
second Rule quoted above.

[I am assuming here, for the sake of argument, that P3710 did
take effect--this message should not be taken as an indication
that I accept that assumption.]

It has long been a game custom that if an adopted Proposal
specifies that in a given Rule, text A is to be replaced
with text B, and text A does not exist in the Rule, a null-amendment
is applied to that Rule.

However, I was looking at Rule 594 recently, and I believe that
that practice has been in error, at least since R594 took
it current form:

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

It seems to me that replacing A with B, when A does not exist,
constitutes an inapplicable provision, and thus it is
ignored, meaning that no amendment, not even a null one, occurs.

Comments?

I think this is a reasonable interpretation of the Rules.

What do you see is the difference between these two cases?

Mainly that a Null Amendment increases a Rule's amendment number,
and must be recorded in the Rule's history, while no amendment
at all does neither.
