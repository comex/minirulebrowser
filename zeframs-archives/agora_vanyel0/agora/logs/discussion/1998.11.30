Just a reminder that Harlequin has been deregistered.

Rereading the Zeitgeist rule I see that there is no Zeitgeist reward
for P3807 because it was not proposed by a player. But I think there
should be a reward according to R947, anyway, becasue this rule
doesn't care whether the proposer is a player or not:

>>
Rule 947/11 (Power=1)
Bonus for Repeal

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 1 P-Note to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.
<<

I'm not sure whether this reward goes to the R-O-M or to the Promotor,
but I seem to remember that the R-O-M received repeal rewards before,
so I guess the R-O-M gets the P-note.

Although I do not own any P-Notes, as far as I know, I would like to be

As there are people out there who are suffering from a lack of P-Notes,
and since I have this nice Promotor's Privilege which I haven't really
been putting to much use, I offer the following deal.

For 1 P-Note I will use my Privilege over two consecutive weeks to raise
the Priority of any Proposal by two, or any two proposals by one. First
come, first served. Two for the price of one. It's a win-win situation.
Any takers?

Impeachment, anyone? ;)

Why not write up everything you learnt connected to your promotor's

Having been Quiet since the 7th of this month, I hereby allege that
Harlequin has abandoned the game.  

As Registrar, I hereby confirm that this is indeed the case, and that
Harlequin is deregistered as of this message.

PS: according to my records, the last thing Harlequin sent to an Agora
    list was a voice sample on 16 October (to agora-discussion).  Did
    anyone listen to the .wav file included in that message?  Even if
    it was a deregistration message, it wouldn't have taken effect

No, no, no, this is *all wrong*. You have to give this Proposal a colour
name! What colour was the last round of repeals? Tourmaline?

I don't think that Rebellion or Zeitgeist fall into any of these
categories, and I certainly won't vote to repeal them. And there are
other Rules in this list, such as Read the Ruleset Week, or Cantus
Cygneus, or even perhaps my own April Fool's Day, which, while they
certainly are little used and unnecessary, I should be sorry to see
repealed.

The Ruleset is a work of art; efficiency criteria don't strictly apply.

As a policy, I keep publishing a Player's holdings until eir Probate

How is that corruption? Am I not free to do as I please with my Promotor's
Privilege? Isn't it just one of the perks of the Job? Would you call it
corruption if I used the VTs I earnt as an Officer to Vote on some else's
proposal? I am offering to make life easier for people with few P-Notes
in the current atmosphere of strong competition. Is that immoral?

> Impeachment, anyone? ;)

Go ahead and impeach. You'd be doing me a favour. I spend far too much
time on this game already. But remember that you'll need to find a 
replacement, and as I remember, nobody was particularly keen last time
I took over the office.

The colo[u]red repeals have traditionally been a set of proposals
that between them proposed to repeal every rule in the ruleset.  I
don't think this qualifies. :)

I prefer "chromatic" -  at least its a word we can all agree on how to spell.

Now if Moredil had've proposed them one by one, a week or more apart,
he would be required to serve for a year or so!

Yes.  However, I think that chromatic repeal naming is reserved for a
series of Proposals, each of which proposes to repeal only one Rule.

Protoproposal Chaos70 [rev. 1]

More Sensible Amendment Numbers

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1069 be amended to read:

      (a) Each Rule shall have an Amendment Number.
        (1) The Amendment Number of a new Rule, when that Rule is
            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;
            if a Rule had no Amendment Number on that version of this
            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.
