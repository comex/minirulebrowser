Blob, I know it's not strictly required, but would you mind terribly
much inserting the Proposal Numbers into the texts of the Proposals, in
line with the practice of previous Promotors?

I'm sorry, I take it all back. Reading R1862 more closely, I realise
that the voting cost on a Proposal is the Voting Tariff at the time it
was distributed. Since Proposals 3787-3788 were distributed last week,
the voting cost for them is still 1 VT. Only Proposals distributed this
week will have a voting cost of 0.5 VTs.

I have serious doubts as to whether the Speaker can justify a belief
that Voting on a Proposal e authored can be considered an act "of
benefit to the Agora community". (It clearly doesn't constitute an
act that "exceed[s] the call of duty", or one of "extreme sacrifice
for the good of the game".) With Voting mechanisms being what they
are, it can be argued that not voting on a Proposal can indicate
opposition to that Proposal as well as indifference; and if part of
the community is opposed to a given Proposal, it is likely that
voting FOR is of benefit only to a particular subset of that
community.

This isn't to say I am opposed to using Patronage in this way,
because one of the things I like about the Patronage Rule is that it
leaves a lot to the Speaker's discretion, but I'd like to caution
the Speaker that 'wasting' Patronage on rewarding routine acts such
as Voting, and compounding the offence by making it look like a bribe
to vote on eir own Proposals, is likely to lose em my Vote in future
S-E Elections.

Is that really so clear? I'll grant that it isn't an act of extreme
sacrifice for the good of the game, but I do believe that Blob's vote is
both beyond the call of duty and an act of benefit to the game. Since I
deplore the attitude that many Players seem to have of saving their
pennies for some non-existent rainy day to come, anyone who votes is, in
my view, setting a fine example. Furthermore, since P3788 failed, it
clearly remains the view of the Agoran community, at least for the
moment, that there is no duty to vote. Until such time as a Proposal
like 3788 is passed, voting will therefore remain an act which is beyond
the call of duty.

I suspect that this will be my last term as Speaker. If the looming
Revolt succeeds, I shall not be standing in any of the Elections.
