It's called Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  Answering what it's for is a
political question and I don't want to get involved.

E goes out of Probate after you announce that the plan has been 
implemented, IIRC.

I seem to remember that some of the POs from the bank to the
Repeal-O-Matic were "satisfied" by TOs naming a so-called Rule-O-Matic
as payee. Now it does sound hairsplitting, but just referreing to the
assessor's assumed intention (Repeal-O-Matic as recipient) does not
seem to be enough to make these TOs valid TOs to the Repeal-O-Matic.

I don't want to COE on this (yet), but I'd like to know what the
assessor and promotor think about this.

I took it as falling under R754 - a spelling error.  Since there was only one
"-O-Matic" entity in existence at the time, I took this to be unambiguous.  Of
course, if you really want to split hairs, "Rule" and "Repeal" are not just
differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, and they certainly aren't
synonyms.

However, I would prefer that you do *not* COE this.  If you think R754 should
be interpreted in a way that would prevent this TO from being valid, please
issue a CFJ to that effect.

I think it's not so much game custom as that it has to be decided
on a case-by-case basis for each rule, depending on how the rule
is worded.  "As soon as possible after the start of each Nomic Week,
the Glorblepiffor must..." requires the Glorblepiffor to catch up
past weeks, due to the nature of ASAP, for example.

It makes discrimination on the grounds of sex illegal.
<<

But why is this necessary? No rules lend themselves to such abuse
explicitly, apart from 1700 they don't refer to sex anyway (What proof
do I have - or need - whether you a male or female?), and illegal
treatment of any player can be prosecuted anyway.

To me this rule looks like a reminder of some scam or other event that
happened before I joined the game - is there such a thing? Otherwise,
I think the rule is quite superfluous.

My mistake.  For some reason I was thinking that the ASAP rule
explicitly stated that if an ASAP duty was not fulfilled within the
specified time limit, the obligation still remained.  But reading R1023,
I see I was wrong.

Yes, but he will immediately reenter it because he will once again be

1) It's funny.
2) It's a oblique comment on American politics.
3) It hurts nothing by being there.
4) There is no fourth reason.
5) It clearly expresses the Agoran committment to the equality of the
   sexes (or lack thereof).
6) Favor wrote it.

I object to this plan on the grounds that it would fail to fully
dispose of Calabresi's estate.  (You should note that Morendil did not
actually object to your plan, since his objection was not posted to
the Public Forum.  I believe his oversight in this regard was
intentional.)

Actually, the Repeal-O-Matic can't do anything with them.  However, the
Promotor, as executor of the R-O-M, can do anything e wants with them.  It's a
nice perk.  8)

Yup.  Basically a Blot is just a Payment Order to pay one Indulgence to the
Bank (this is a (relatively) recent definition of a Blot).

Rule 1023 is silent on whether such obligations remain.  I would hold
that the obligations remain.  To quote Rule 1023: "Rather, this Rule
defines the latest time at which actions to be performed `as soon as
possible' may be performed without incurring a Penalty."  This, to me,
indicates that Rule 1023 does not act to discharge a duty if that duty
is not performed in accordance with its requirements, but merely
imposes a penalty for having failed to do so.

Pretty much.  Actually, it's more along the lines that Blots are
anti-Indulgences.  In fact, that's exactly what they were, at one

DIS: COE on Harlequin's win

I'm not sure when it was issued, but if Chuck's interpretation of R1431 is
correct, then it only matters that you were a Player when the alloted time to
respond to the COE expired.  Which you were.

I haven't decided yet whether I agree with Chuck's interpretation.  One thing I
will note, however, is that there seems to be no specification of an alloted
time for Players other than the one required by the Rules to maintain the
information to which the COE pertains.  Based on this, I think Chuck's Payment
Orders are improperly made (except for the Player to whom it really pertained).
What do others think?

Once upon a time there were only Blots.  At some time I noticed that
having Blots was not unlike having a negative amount of a Currency (Points
could be used to buy off Blots at the time, I think.)  But I didn't do
anything about the idea for (I think) at least a year.

The autumn 1996 there was (again) talk of whether we could create
something resembling an actual trade economy in Agora.  At the time,
almost everything in the game worth buying could be bought automatically
using Voting Tokens - either you had the only valuable Currency or not,
and there was little point in trading. The cure, it was felt, was to
create new Currencies that could _not_ be automatically converted to each
other, so that Players had to trade for them.

So I picked up the idea of the anti-Blot (at the same time as others
worked on Proposal Notes), someone suggested the name of Indulgences, I
included in the Proposal something to beef Blots up a bit with Debt and
Lawlessness (as well as a slight scarcity of Blots), and thus the Currency
was born last spring.

In fact, there has been some trade with Indulgences, but after we
discovered the initial bugs in Scott's Pragmatic Currencies system (which
changed Blots into Payment Orders) things more or less broke down.  Plans
are under way to make Currencies scarcer again.

Greetings,
rjan.

Actually, if they were improperly made on thiese grounds, then the
one for Harlequin was improperly made as well.  As Harlequin was not
*required* to post the announcment of his win, he is also not
required to respond to the COE.

Good point.  8)  That should probably be fixed too.

This is because (1) there is a tradition of small correction Proposals
being passed by only the Proposer Voting FOR and everyone else declaring
Presence, and (2) they would get a Zeitgeist award anyhow.


More general comments related to Agoran Custom:

1) Capitalize "proposal", "rules", "vote", "quorum" and "proposer".  In
general, most nouns and adjectives that are defined by the Rules are
capitalized.  Verbs seem to be random, with a tendency toward not
capitalizing - it probably depends on who made the Rule text.

2) Indentation should be by 6 spaces not 5.

rjan.

     I thought I should have done this, but then I remembered Steve
asking someone to not capitalize the phrase "as soon as possible".  I
guess I became confused because I had been thinking that any
term/phrase that is defined in the rules should be capitalized. "As
soon as possible" does have a definition, so it would seem right to
me to capitalize it.

Thanks for your input, Orjan.

That is not exactly what I suggested. My suggestion was for a 2 VT
reward for a Player if e gets a Proposal passed in a given week (but
no extra reward for if e gets two Proposals passed).

Personally, I'm not keen to turn Agora into a Stock Market game.

I don't love these RGB manouevres either, but they are necessary.
Basically they are a way of saying: the Rules we've been experimenting
with are poorly designed (largely by me, I must confess), time to
start again. Economic solutions sound nice in principle, but they
will take enormous amounts of time to produce scarcity. I would like
to emphasize that I am not simply proposing to wipe out most VTs,
leaving the mechanisms which produced VT inflation untouched. I am
also proposing to repeal R1684.

This is not the amendment to R833 I suggested, nor would I support it.
It's too generous with VTs, which is precisely the thing I'm trying to
avoid. Here's my original suggested amendment:

####
Proto-Proposal
End P-Note Inflation

[Comment: here's a form of R833 I'd be happy with. Blob, if you like
it and think it would be appropriate, feel free to incorporate it
into your proto.]

Be it hereby resolved that the Title of Rule 833 be changed to "Rewards
for Passing Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted a Proposal which was adopted during the previous
      Week.

I agree that an ASAP action would work this way, but not all our rules
are phrase that way. For example, Rule 1007 states that the Registrar
should pay salaries "At the beginning of each Nomic Week", ie at 
midnight GMT each Monday. I'm not even sure that e is legally permitted
to make the appropriate POs at any other time.

This aspect of the ruleset needs to be revamped. I'm meant to be working
on a paper at the moment, but maybe sometime or other I'll get around to
doing it.

This is a terrible Statement, and I don't envy the Judge who will
have to judge it. To be thorough, the Judge will have to check
every instance in the Rules where a Player is required to perform
an action, a terrifying prospect. If you were interested in the
particular case of Officers and their Reports, then why didn't you
say so?

See Rule 1599.  "Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment
Order, e is required to do so within seven days."  I think this
sufficiently resolves this problem.

>> Steve:  Welcome, Time Agent! Greetings from the present. <<

     I'm an Agora Player from the year 2011.  I didn't like where the
Ruleset was headed (you can't even imagine), so I decided to tinker
with it in 1998.  I guess it's cheating in a way, but there aren't
any Rules against it... yet. ;-)

And, I would add, we have a long tradition of reading R1023 in this way.

Or at least, it would be if P-Notes were useful for anything. Hopefully,
that will soon be true.

Okay, but if e doesn't do it within that time, then is there any room
for em to "catch-up" on such payments in later weeks?

If Chuck's interpretation is upheld, then yes, we do. However, I doubt
that Chuck's interpretation will be upheld. He is reading the fourth
prargraph of R1431 out of context; in particular, out of the context of
the third paragraph, which states:

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made...

The fourth pragraph then goes on to say:

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response

I think we are justified in taking the Player of the fourth paragraph
as being the same as the Player in the third paragraph, ie in reading
the fourth paragraph as saying, implicitly, "A Player (who, as above,
is required to provide a response and) who fails to post a Response..."

Question: is it a Crime or Infraction or even just a violation of the
Rules to wrongfully allege that another Player has committed an
Infraction?

Because I'm not just interested in Official Reports. I'm interested 
in the general principle. If the rules say that a player must do
something at time X (or between X and Y), and the player does not do
so, apart from the Player having broken the rules, does the obligation
to act linger?

I don't see that the statement is so bad. My interpretation is that it
is asking whether the requirement to act remains, without any further
indications by the Rules. Ie, it is a matter of how we interpret a
certain category of rules, not a quesiton of whether there are any rules
that satisfy the condition.

Oh well, I guess it is up to the Judge to work it out now.

I like the idea, I'm not so keen on the 3 VT award, since I'm trying
to keep VTs inputs into the economy down. Still, it's probably uncommon
enough to do no harm.

I think perhaps that the convention is approximately the German one
of capitalizing nouns. 'As soon as possible' is an adverbial phrase.

As a prospective (retrospective?) time traveller, it seems likely to
me that you would have read up on the history of the time you intended
to visit. So tell me: how did your attempted intervention work out?
I guess it must have been a failure...

     Maybe he wants to have a higher chance of the R-O-M Proposals
actually passing.  If he were to try to repeal 'useful' Rules, he
would more than likely fail.
     Maybe David has some Master Plan that has to do with having tons

R1599 continues:

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order by the
      Rules fails to do so in the time required by this and other
      Rules, and a CFJ determines that this has in fact happened, the
      Judge of that CFJ shall make an Injunction requiring emself to
      execute the Order required in the stead of the nonperforming Player.

Notes:

1. R1599 is silent concerning the case where a Player fails to execute
a PO as required, but no CFJ is made. So G. Chaos spoke to hastily when
he claimed that R1599 'resolves this problem'.

2. R1599 concerns only POs. Your CFJ is much, much broader.

Right, and my point is that a moment's reflection on this question
should have revealed to you that there is no reason to think that
there is a single, over-arching answer to this question, but quite
possibly a whole bunch of answers differing on a case by case basis.
The Judge will therefore have little choice but to look at every possible
case in which the Rules require a Player to act, and then ask and answer
the question the Statement poses for that case. That is a frightening
amount of work. I say 'little choice' because if I were the Judge I'd
be tempted to invoke R1565(vi) and dismiss the CFJ on the grounds
that determination of its truth or falsity would require an
unreasonable effort.

     How about instead of a 3 VT award, the Proposer gets to make a
one-time 3FOR or 3AGAINST vote on a Proposal for the cost of only 1

I meant that to mean that it resolves the problem of a Payment Order

I must say I'm perplexed at this policy you apparently have of not
proposing to repeal 'useful' Rules. If I were Promotor, I'd be looking
at making ROM Proposals with an eye to their scam potential, trying
to get people to think about courses of action which might be to their
advantage if only they just get such-and-such a Rule repealed. I know
I did this once, when the repeal of 'No Coercive Proposals' was proposed
as part of the Tourmaline Repeals.

I wondered whether you would know about that. Of course, I didn't
want to say anything before I knew whether it had re-onturned out
wentingsoon to be a success. But apparently, it wioll haven be a
success, which is great news for me. Thanks! With that knowledge, I
am suddenly filled with the confidence I need to actually go ahead
and execute the plan.

Really? I'm rather at a loss to see how. Isn't our method of inter-
pretation something we bring to the rules, rather than something we
gain from them?

Anyway, what I am looking for is not so much a judgement on any 
particular existing rule, but a reassurance that if I write a rule
"Player X should do Y every week." that it will be interpreted in
a predictable way.

Not if the person reporting the Infraction believes it to be
correct.

It's times like this that I wish we had an "actual controversy" rule.

Malcolm> Huh?

An "actual controversy" rule prohibits the invocation of judicial
process without an actual controversy.  Broad, vague questions (such
as your recent CFJ) are not justiciable in such a system because there
is no actual controversy.
