R1567 does not have any form of "explicitly" in it.

Example:  On August 10, 1998, I send a message to the CotC saying "I make
myself ineligible to judge any CFJs called during 1999". On April 1, 1999,
CFJ 1234 is called.  My message of August 10 specifies (implicitly) that I
have made myself ineligible to judge CFJ 1234.

Here's another potential monkey wrench:  If a message of the class "I make
myself ineligible to judge any CFJs called during <time period>" is sent to
the CotC, and then during <time period> the Office of CotC becomes held by
a player who didn't receive the message, then is the message still
effective?  If yes, then we do have a Crisis.  If no, then the player whom
Macross quoted has made themselves *permanently* ineligible to judge CFJs,
since their message included no "until further notice" type wording.

I'm afraid I'm a little slow this morning.  Why would this mean there is a

I point out that Swann currently holds the Patent Title of Miscreant,
which is not included in the Registrar's Report. I have been meaning to 
propose a fix to the Miscreant rule for a while, to have the Herald 
report it, like with the Samurai, and to add a precedence clause to
fix the interaction with Rebellion.

Which reminds me, we haven't had a Rebellion since the new system was
imposed, three months ago. Anyone interested?

It seems to me that since R1047 has had its current form (last
amended by P3717), if not before, the Patent Title of Zeitgeist
is not revoked when it is awarded to a new player.

Okay, how's this for a more interesting proposal:

Proposal: Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

In my case this is not entirely true.  In this era of VT scarceness I am
very reluctant to spend my VTs on votes, but I have done so.  I am also
willing to allow someone to pay for my voting on a Proposal for which I wish
to demonstrate minor support (since I can't declare Presence).  At the risk
of repeating what I have said on more than one occasion, I simply feel that
with my current income, most Proposals simply are not worth 1 VT to me.

I am actually considering the possibility of running for Office so I can get
some VTs to spend.  However, I feel that it would have to be one of the less
demanding Offices as I am not really up to speed on several aspects of the
Rules.  Any recommendations on which Offices would make a good entry-level
position for an aspiring public servant?
