Indeed.  In fact, I think this might be a very useful thing to do.
However, I would allow also for the possibility of some object being
owned by one Player and in the possession of another.  Detached
ownership is not unreasonable, after all.

Not conceptually unreasonable, no. But what use would it be? Imagine
a more simple situation first: I leave some VTs of mine sitting on
Area 25. Perhaps I cannot use them while they are there (eg, Area 25 
is a Bank where investments can be left to mature at a later date).
This is an example of detached ownership: my VTs are not where I am.
But why would anyone else want to pick them up, assuming it was legal
for them to do so? Not being the oowners, they won't be able to derive
any benefit from them. Unless you're thinking of quite complex kinds
of transactions, eg: "Jeff, could you move to Area 25 and pick up
my investments for me while I go to Area 87 and secure ownership of
that Area?" Recordkeeping for such cases is probably more trouble
than it's worth.

Well, if el Jefe hadn't thought of the possibility to retract Against

ago, and with a solid majority. I'm planning to try again, but haven't

We seem to have problems to distribute VTs such that we avoid
inflation. But why not take care of this explicitly? For example:

leave the VT stipend as it is, but reduce the amount paid out as
follows: 

- no reduction (i.e. pay out as we do now) if the total number of VTs
in circulation (i.e. in existence, but not owned by the bank) is
smaller or equal to 5 times the number of players

- halve this amount if the number of VTs in circulation is between 5
and 10 times the number of players

- only pay out 1 VT if the number of VTs in circulation is larger than
10 times the number of players


This will always tend to modify the number of VTs in circulation to
something like 5 or 10 per player (on average - including VTs held by
organizations): if there are too many VTs around, the stipend is
reduced; if there are too few, well, the current system provides
enough inflation to get more into circulation.

I think this is much simpler than regular RGB's, or the intricate
plots economy (which has no provisions against inflation now, it
seems). 

Would you vote for something like this?

A few days ago I suggested something along these lines but even simpler.
The idea was not well received. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not
the person you have to convince.

Proto-Proposal
Repeal P-Notes

[Comment: even if Proposal Notes worked, only that small group of
Players who actually make Proposals with any regularity would care
about them. Better, I think, to give up on them altogether as an
interesting idea that didn't quite work.]

[Comment: I've added a provision to deal with Disinterest. If the
Proposal passes, Rule 833 will be repealed and the major motivation
for having Disinterestedness as a concept in the Ruleset will have
disappeared.  Nevertheless, excising Disinterestedness from the
Ruleset is a separate issue I don't want to deal with here. Likewise,
I've added provisions remiving all references to Petition Fees.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1701 ('Proposal Notes') be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1702 ('Petition Fee for Proposals') be
repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1727 ('Happy Birthday') be amended by
replacing the text "and shall pay out to each such Contest 5 VTs, and
to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;" with the text "and shall pay
out to each such Contest 5 VTs;".

[Be it further resolved that R1451 ('Disowning Proposals') be repealed.]

Be it further resolved that R1760 ('Quorum Buyback') be amended by
replacing the text "one P-Note" with the text "three Voting Tokens".

Be it further resolved that R833 ('Awards & Penalties for Proposals')
be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R947 ('Bonus for Repeal') be amended by
replacing the text "3 P-Notes" with the text "one Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1047 ('Patent Title of Zeitgeist') be
amended by replacing the text "one P-Note" with the text "one Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1542 ('Style Points') be amended by
replacing every occurrence of the string "P-Note" with the string
"Indulgence".

Be it further resolved that R1748 ('Awards for Internomic Proposals')
be amended by replacing the text "In the case where the InterNomic
Proposal passes, the award shall be five Voting Tokens and two
Proposal Notes." with the text "In the case where the InterNomic
Proposal passes, the award shall be five Voting Tokens."

Be it further resolved that R1623 ('Disinterested Proposals') be
amended to read:

      A Proposal is Disinterested if its Proposer informs the
      Promotor that the Proposal is a Disinterested Proposal, before
      the Proposal is distributed by the Promotor. If a Proposal is
      not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Be it further resolved that R1723 ('Sanity') be amended by deleting
from it the sentence: "The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is
increased by three."

Be it further resolved that R1724 ('Emergency Proposals') be amended
by deleting from it the sentence: "The Petition Fee for an Emergency
Proposal is increased by two."

Is making Sane and, more importantly, Emergency Proposals free such a

We've yet to have a Sane or Emergency Proposal, so how can we know?

Well, I'll vote against it twice. P-Notes haven't had a fair run.
Allowing free Disinterested propsals was a mistake, imho, but one
that is easily fixed. We're never going to have any kind of economy
around here if we are not willing to have to pay for things.

As for the recordkeeping - I'm willing to take over the Promotorship
if its current holder is overwhelmed.

As far as I know, the recordkeeping is not a problem. The first problem,
as ever, is inflation. Certainly we could fix that without repealing
P-Notes altogether. Basically, you'd destroy all the P-Notes
currently in existence, distribute one or two to each Player, and
repeal R833. But there doesn't seem much point when most Players
don't make Proposals and so have little incentive to acquire P-Notes,
other than the fairly remote prospect of selling them to those
Players who do make Proposals. The only way to make that prospect
less remote would be to clamp down incredibly hard on P-note
circulation, so that there were never more than say 5 or 10 floating
around at any time.

I'll tell you what: if I propose to repeal P-Notes and the Proposal
fails, I'll work up a compromise Proposal along the lines sketched
above. This will involve removing almost all P-note inputs from the
economy in order to impose real scarcity, and amending R833 so that
it gives limited rewards of VTs or Indulgences (and I mean limited,
none of this F-A profligacy) - so that Players will have an incentive
to pay the Petition Fee. Or why wait for me? You can write it up
yourself,

On a related note, I don't think I can be bothered waiting for the
processes of natural attrition to remove 900 VTs from circulation,
even assuming my Proposal to repeal R1684 passes. How would people
feel about *real* VT scarcity, *now*: all VTs held by Groups and
Contests are returned to the Bank or destroyed, and each Player starts
afresh with 5 VTs. We'll never get to explore the politics of scarcity
if we keep burdening ourselves with the history of our past failures.

That's not true. We've just never had either in their current 
incarnation. I'm not sure about Sane proposals, but Emergency proposals
have been in and out of the ruleset since early days, and have been
used on more than one occasion (usually for scamming purposes).

I think Blob is partly right and partly wrong here. I absolutely agree
that an economy will not develop while people can get all the things
they want for free. That was the motivation for removing the right to
vote for free, and I still think that principle is sound. If we're going
to keep P-Notes, we certainly should follow Blob's suggestion and stop
letting people make Disinterested Proposals for free.

I disagree with Blob slightly when he says that in order for trading
to happen, there need to be at least two different commodities of
value. Or rather, I agree with that statement, but I understand the
word 'commodity' more abstractly than Blob does, judging by his use
of VTs and P-Notes as examples of commodities. I think it would be
possible to have interesting trading even if VTs were the only
Currency. It's just that what people would have to trade would not
be other Currencies (obviously, since ex hypothesi there wouldn't be
any) but other favours, most likely their commitments to vote in
certain ways. On this view, one's influence on a Proposal is a 
commodity of value to be traded like any other, although it is not
a Currency. None of this should be taken as an argument for getting
rid of P-Notes, however. The ability to make Proposals is also a
commodity of value, at least for some people, and I'm actually quite
sympathetic to Blob's attempts to rescue them. If my proto to repeal
them has moved Blob to respond, then it may have already achieved
its purpose.

Please, please, please, decapitalize 'As Soon As Possible'. 

Will you permit me a little advice? If you want to turn this into a
complete rescue package for P-Notes, then add provisions which 
thoroughly overhaul P-Note inputs into the economy, in particular the
odious R833. The aim would be to make P-Notes pretty damn hard to come
by. My personal feeling is that when people are desperate enough for
them to consider taking on an Office which might have its Salary paid
in P-Notes just in order to acquire them (once P-Notes are really scarce,
why not amend the Officer Rules so that Officer can choose whether to
be paid in P-Notes or VTs?), that's when they're getting scarce enough
for my tastes. So the last thing you have to is propose to remove from
circulation all or nearly all of the P-Notes currently floating around.

I think you are remembering Nomic World. I don't think we've ever had
Emergency Proposals in the Agoran Ruleset until this recent
incarnation appeared. Sanity we did have, back in the days of the
Vototron, when Groups cast as many votes as they had members. I think
it was free then.

First, I think it is important to point out that it is physically impossible
for any Player action to either directly or indirectly change the game state at
a time prior to that action.  It *is* possible for an action to cause us to
recalculate the game state in such a way as to make it compatible with a
different prior game state, i.e. to make it look as if the game state was
different than it actually was at some point in the past.  IMO, the proposal as
worded is simply a restatement of this physical impossibilty.

I agree that it is desireable to prevent Player actions or Rules from forcing
us to make such recalculations, however, I think it would be better to make
this distinction explicit in the proposal and avoid any kind of pretense that
the past could actually be changed.  To use Steve's example above, an ideal (to
my mind) formulation would allow *future* changes to the game state that depend
on the implementation date of Rule R to use the artificial, legally deemed date
but would prevent that date from needing to be used in any *prior* game state
calculations.

Scott, shouln't you be including records of the High Style Mark of

I agree with you that the past cannot be changed. I think we agree however,
that the Rules can in principle require us to behave as though the past 
were different to what we know it to have been. My examples above are
intended to show this, and also to explore the question of whether this
view is compatible with Scott's metaphysical view that only Players and
not the Rules have agency.

True enough.  Still, not many of us have been around long enough to
remember the prior incarnations.

It would be a shame to repeal them when I've already written the code
into the Assessor's script to handle them, though. :)

As I recall, Sanity cost 1 Mark back then.

Actually, I was just using VTs and P-Notes as a shorthand. I agree
that the real "things of value" are the ability to make proposals
and the ability to influence whether or not they take effect. (More
fundamentally, both of these are based on the power to change the 
rules, and prevent unwanted changes.)

I just think it is convenient to have these concepts concretised into
tradable tokens - VTs and P-Notes.

Okay, so you've forced me to get around to doing this. I've been 
talking about it for a long time, I suppose I ought to out some effort
in. What really keeps me back from making more proposals is a difficulty
in finding the appropriate language to express my ideas as rules.

I just looked at this. Urk! I didn't realise that the situation was so 
bad! Would anyone object to having 833 repealed entirely? Obviously most
people don't care for the F-A rewards as it stands (or else we'd have
more Interested proposals). I say just get rid of it.

Other supplies of P-Notes are:

Bonus for Repeal: 3 P-Notes (R947)
Zeitgeist award: 1 P-Note (R1047)
Increasing Style: 1 P-Note/2 Points (R1542)
Birthday presents: 2 P-Notes (R1727)

The bonus for repeal is probably too high, but I think the others are
small & rare enough to be left as-is.

(Sound's kind of like my Jobs & Wages...) Perhaps, except that this means
we would have to set a firm exchange rate between VTs and P-Notes, which
I would rather leave up to the populace.

What if players were allowed to quote their preferred pay rate when they
nominated for an election? Interesting idea... :)

I agree with you that this is a problem. If P-Notes are so abundant 
that proposing is effectively free anyway, then there is no point in 
having them at all. I would argue that the same is already happening 
with VTs.

A thought that just occurred to me: how about we try a different 
approach to solving the problem. The "natural" solution to inflation
is to increase prices. Now, we have already experimented with this
using the Mil (what a disaster) - but what if we tried a different
approach. What would happen if we removed the upper limit on VT
spending? That way prices would naturally settle to whatever level
players are willing to spend. (If we do this, I would be very much
in favour of a general resetting of VT holdings beforehand.)

I have an idea for a similar system for limitless spending of P-Notes,
but I'd like to flesh that out a bit before advertising it.

Of course, it would still be a good idea to restrict supply somewhat.
The problem is, it is hard to predict what spending patterns will
become. When we proposed pay-for-voting, the VT supply was 
desgined to be relatively small, compared to average spending at the
time. But as soon as pay-for-voting was put it place, voting patterns
changed radically. Now the VT Stipend is luxurious.

Just a quick check of recent Assessor's reports shows that proposals
3601-3655 were made by 12 different players. General Chaos made about
half of them (ouch!), but the other 11 of us made between 1 and 6 
each. That doesn't seem too bad to me.

I agree. 

Blob

Addendum: One of the goals of the Plot's proto, when I first conceived it
(as Job's & Wages) was to provide a means of letting Supply naturally
adapt to meet Demand, rather than artificially setting it. Players
control production; if too much is being produced it becomes valueless,
and the player has incentive to cut back.

Hear, hear! I like P-Notes and think that, should we make them suitably
scarce and provide enough interesting things to do with them, they could
certainly succeed. We do need to reform them, though. I suggest we follow
Steve's suggestion of repealing R833 -- the number of P-Notes produced by
it is ridiculous.
