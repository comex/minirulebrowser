Thanks.

Incidentally Morendil, you have to conduct the Election for the office
of Registrar.

Moreover, the Judgement which found that you hadn't won has not yet
been overturned or found incorrect.  Therefore, vacating the original
PO was the correct thing to do.  The Injunction makes no difference at
all.  (It was illegal for it to require me to vacate the PO, but that
does not make it illegal for me to vacate the PO. :-)

I must say that for young nomics I consider a players' list in a rule
a good solution. I would also prefer to determine officers by listing
their names in the relevant rules. Why? Because then changes of voting
members, officers, etc don't need special voting and election
procedures, but can use the existing procedural framework of proposals
and rule amendments. Closing holes, removing bugs and generally
evolving to hogher complexity in three areas at the same time
(players, officers, proposals) with three different mechanisms sems to
be a bit work for a small, slowmoving nomic.

As far as liaisons are concerned, I think it is a good idea to require
that every nomic conduct all its IN related business through one
single, publically known liaison. Otherwise nomics could export all
kinds of internal power struggles, conflicts about who is allowed to
act in IN on behalf of the nomic, etc to create a lot of game state
uncertainties in IN. E.g., without liaisons, whose message to the
moderator (or the IN list) will be counted as valid vote of a nomic?
The first message claiming to be a vote? The last one? What if someone
sends a message that claims to be a vote, and eir status as player of
the voting nomic is unclear? I'm afraid abolishing liaisons could lead
to very unpleasant consequences.

Timing of messages

Seems to me that the best way for things to work is to consider all Player
actions to take place at the moment they are initiated, e.g. a report is
submitted at the time it was sent, but that collateral effects of a Player
action are considered to take effect at the moment it can reasonably be
considered that those affected have become aware of that action, e.g. another
Player's obligation to satisfy a PO issued in the report begins at the moment
the report is received in the PF.  Is this worth legislating?

As I think I have clearly explicated, the "moment the report is
received in the PF" is not necessarily well-defined.

Yes, but I was under the impression that you had also made it clear a
reasonable approximation of that moment could be determined.  That was the
point of my "reasonably considered" language - the example was just an example.

Define "correct." At the time, since there was an outstanding Injunction to
do so, it was "correct." But the Injunction in question was overturned,
which I would assume would make it incorrect.

Does this mean that, even if this occurs and my Champion's Reward is
reissued, I don't get to keep my 10 VTs? This is ridiculous. 

I mean, I would have assumed that, in this situation, the PO from me to the
Bank would be vacated. Why would this PO remain?

Hi all,


I've just wasted some time browsing around in the nomics listed in the
Nomic database (<http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/nomic/>). I came
across at least two developments that might be interesting to Agorans:


.Nomic crashed (well, kinda) a few days ago: they had one rule that
gave points to players with exceedingly low scores (low measured by
comparison with the score needed to win), and another one concerning
wins, which contained the usual provisions for resetting all scores to
zero after a win, etc, and a nontrivial, automated selfmodification of
this rule: doubling the number of points needed to win the next game.

Now the first rule contained a typo or mistake or something, so
immediately after it was created it gave points to basically everyone;
a few players won simultaneously, triggering the post-win
routine. With their scores just reset to zero, everyone received bonus
points from the rule with the typo again, until someone won, and so on
ad infinitum, driving both the score needed for a win and the scores
of all players to infinity in no time at all (no, I don't want to
start another thread on infinitesimals... :)

.Nomic has continued to play, not bothering about possible speaker
changes due to wins (possible, as that part of their post-win cleanup
is very flexible), because only the scoring and winning procedures are
caught in the infinite loop, while proposing etc may go on.

I guess it _is_ good to have a rule that prevents rapid multiple wins,
after all...


A second funny coincidence is that OxNomic just introduced a concept
very similar to our R-O-M, although they used structures inherent to
their game: they now have a "Puppet" (non-human player, unable to win,
guided by a human - executor like - player) called "Death" that
randomly selects rules and proposes their repeal...

I wonder whether this is really a coincidence, or there was some
communication between us and them. It may be coincidence, because
while the idea is the same, the realization, name, fluff vocabulary
etc is quite different from our R-O-M.


Well, that's the foreign news for today, I'm your Ambassador Kolja

Grrrrr.

So, if the Judge finds that I did indeed Win, then the vacation PO will be
vacated, and a Champion's Reward PO reissued, correct? So if I have already
satisfied this current PO for 10 VTs, and the Judge rules that I Won, it'll
be *someone's* job to issue two POs of 10 VTs to me. Is that correct?

Could one of our richer players possibly give me a loan, to prevent me from
suffering from further PI infractions while I wait for this to play out?

The Injunction is not required; the Officer can voluntarily recognize,
as Michael did, that eir Order was improvident and vacate it without
an Injunction.  The Injunction merely provides relief in the case that
the Officer fails to do so.

You already got the VTs; they were taken away in Steve's carelessly
written mass looting Proposal.

Chaos> I mean, I would have assumed that, in this situation, the PO

Because you received the VTs improperly originally, it is your duty to
return them.  Steve's Proposal failed to account for the fact that
they would be taken away from you before you could do so.  

I would suggest that you should demand those people who voted for
"Restore Game Balance III" to reimburse you for your injury.

Thanks.  For anyone who's interested in questioning this, I've

not the more general issue.)

>> Swann:  PROTO: Ownership of Rules <<

     I like this idea.  How about having a maximum number of Rules
that one Entity can own and then allow Rules to own other Rules.  So,
for example, the maximum for Players could be four, and the max for
Rules could be equal to their Power.
     Then, each Player will have a Power Structure of Rules under
their control.  Players could then try to wrest control of Rules from
other Players with hostile takeovers. (a la Illuminati)
     As I currently have no VTs and no reliable way to get them :-( ,
I don't really have much say in it right now.  But when you do decide
to Propose it, I'll vote for it if you give me some Tokens.  :-)

You misunderstand me. I am all for having a single Liason. What I don't 
like is the fact that the Internomic rules assume that every member Nomic
always has one. What happens when a Nomic suddenly doesn't have a Liason,
due to a crisis? Does it continue to be a voting member?

I would recommend that a nomic is given a period of grace in which it is
to find itself a new liason. If this period expires, without a new liason
being appointed, then the nomic suffers a loss of status.

I don't seem to recall you taking this particular stance when the Proposal

Wait -- another question. Since the issue is still before the courts as to
whether they were received properly or not, shouldn't the PO in question be
considered Contested? (I need to go read these PC rules. Again.)

My enthusiasm for the game is rather significantly lessened when a
run-of-the-mill scam results, rather than in a modest reward, in unpayable
bills and ridiculous fines. Begging the populace for handouts is not an
improvement.
