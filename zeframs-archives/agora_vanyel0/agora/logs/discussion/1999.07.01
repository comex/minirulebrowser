I'm the only person registered with a British e-mail address but I'm
actually a New Zealander (and six years ago I was in New Zealand; I
moved here in 1994).  Of course, it's possible that other Players
might be in Britain without having a .uk address, and it's also
possible that Players not in Britain might still be British.

Nonetheless I suspect that there are currently no British Players.  Of
course, New Zealanders and Australians typically prefer British
spellings, so I'm all for the removal of "honor" wherever it may
occur.

[I translated 'Roy d'Angolmois' as 'Moon-King of England', because I have

Yep, original text, with some doubt about the apostrophe, and a lot of

Most interpreters seem to think it is an anagram for "Mongolois", i.e.
Genghis Khan.

All CotC business will be handled tomorrow; I've been having some computer
problems the last couple days, but they've been solved now. All that remains
is to install all my old software on my entirely new computer... ;-)

This from the player who's transferred more VTs for others' voting than
anyone lately. ;)

There's a difference between electioneering *inside* a Proposal and 
electioneering *outside* a Proposal.  :)

Besides, many of the VTs I have transferred have been to Players who expressed
interest in voting FOR the Proposals.  My main problem has been that my 
Proposals have the frequent property of failing Quorum.  Providing assistance
to Voters who might not otherwise vote (FOR *or* AGAINST) on one of my Proposals
I consider to be a service rather than bribery.
