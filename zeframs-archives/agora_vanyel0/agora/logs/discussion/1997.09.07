Harlequin, could you please remember to limit your lines to 70 characters

In each case we have a phrase with a natural meaning that is hard,
even impossible, to pin down by giving necessary and sufficient
conditions that pick out all and only the cases which we intuitively
would wish to fall under some proposed definition. In each case we
have a choice about how to react to this situation: we can either go
ahead and give a legal definition anyway, so fixing the meaning of
the phrase for our purposes regardless of whatever clashes with the
natural meaning of the phrase the legal definition may produce, or we
can leave the term legally undefined, (so relying on our intuitive
understanding of the meaning of the phrase), and allow the Courts to
decide on a case by case basis whether some particular set of
circumstances falls under the definition. I take it that your argument
is that leaving the Courts to decide on a case by case basis whether
some action had or had not been performed as soon as possible would
in the first place, generate too many cases for the Courts to decide,
and in the second place, would result in a bad definition of the
phrase 'as soon as possible' (bad for our purposes, that is), since
in general we want to give Players more time to act than the intuitive
urgency of 'as soon as possible' would otherwise permit. This makes
it look as though R1023 is another example of a legal fiction, despite
its being a paradigm example of redefinition, which makes we wonder
about that whole distinction. Hmmm...

Anyway, you make the further claim that leaving the Courts to decide
on a case by case basis the meaning of 'made available' would not
result in a similar problem (of ending up with a definition not suited
to our purposes), and that seems plausible enough, although there's
certainly room for doubt about it. If it things did turn out that way,
then 'made available' would have turned out to be somewhat like 'receive',
which the Courts determined to mean 'enter the normal technical domain
of control', a very useful definition indeed.

When (OK, make that 'if') Crito admits the COEs, you will be
required to vacate the PO. Rule 1733 reads, in part :

      When a a COE regarding a Payment Order is accepted, the order
      shall be vacated (and an new order issued, if appropriate).

And that's all it says. I submit that past Game Custom supports the
view that the Player who executed a PO is implicitly authorized to
vacate it, thus the requirement to vacate applies to you, as
executor of the PO. Rule 1733 doesn't require the COE to be adressed
to you, however (or even to concern substantial properties of the
PO, i.e. Currency, Payor, Payee or amount, which seems...
dysfunctional).

If that is true, I shall indeed have, as you claim, to seek relief
via CFJ. However I don't see that the Infraction and PO Rules can
currently be interpreted that way. Penalties for Infractions are
applied upon their "legal report". Only upon such is the Player
reporting such authorized to execute POs. If no Infraction has been
committed the report is not "legal" in any sense that I can imagine.
In the present case the PO upon which the Persistent Indebtedness
Infraction rests was itself not a legal PO.

IMHO it was a mistake to have this "authorized to execute" language
in the PO Rules. We should change this so that a PO is a PO, the
"Disputed" status is enough to shield putative payees from the
effects of illegally submitted POs.

But tell me, if it is ruled that this PO was indeed validly issued,
upon what grounds could a Court then order it vacated ?

I disagree.  At the time I reported the Infraction, the condition
which constituted the Infraction held.  The future disputation or
vacation of the PO which led to the Infraction in question does not
change the validity of the Infraction I reported.

Only if the PO which was supposedly overdue was a legally executed 
one, which it wasn't.

How about "96 hours before the proposal's voting period is scheduled to
end"?

I agree that this is generally a good idea.

More accurately, presenting information as true when you believe it's
false.  (Even if it turns out to be true after all!)

Does this allow later Frankenstein Rule amendments to occur?


Proto:  Plastic Surgery

Amend the Frankenstein Rule by deleting this text:

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

Replace "substantial portion" and "cosmetic change" with new,

Was this attempted vote counted?  (Not that it matters; the vote was
either 3-5 or 3-6 or 3-7, and Agora votes against in any case.)

I don't understand what effect that would have.

Does it prohibit removing Rule publishing from the Rules? - Not something
to put in a Power 1 Rule in my opinion. 

Does it make all Players collectively responsible for making the Ruleset
available? In that case, will all Players be punished if it doesn't
happen anyhow?

Does it deem the Ruleset to be available, regardless? In that case, don't
use "must", use something like "For the purpose of this Rule the Ruleset
is always available."

Greetings,
Ørjan.

I think I counted it.  I consider the typographical error to fall
within the realm of Rule 754, since it is clearly meaningless to
speak of INP 364 at this time.

A Protoproposal, to eliminate the ambiguity of the validity of
the Execution of various Payment Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1562 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "A Payment Order is executed..." and the paragraph
beginning "A Player only has the authority..." with the following
paragraph:

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player posts the Order to the
      Public Forum.  If a Player executes a Payment Order without the
      authority to do so, e must vacate that Order as soon as
      possible.  A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment
      Order if e required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an
      Injunction, or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to
      execute that Order.  A Player who executes a Payment Order
      implicitly claims that e is authorized to do so, and this
      implicit claim may be alleged to be in error, as a Claim of
      Error.

Comments:

This makes all Payment Orders properly executed even if unauthorized.
The "implicit claim" language makes the execution of a Payment Order
subject to a Claim of Error regarding this claim of authorization, and
further makes the knowing execution of unauthorized Orders subject to
penalties for Misrepresentation.  

This wording allows anyone to execute any Payment Order.  However,
willful abuse is punishable by CFJ, and will probably also be subject
to punishment by Kudo transfer or other social sanction.  At worst, a
malfeasant offender will merely generate paperwork for various
Officers.

Proto-proposal:
======================================================================
Rule 1494/1 is repealed and Rule 869/6 is amended to read:

A Registrant is any person who is registering as a Player.

A person is registering as a Player when e sends a message
to the Public Forum requesting Registration.

When a person becomes a Registrant, the Registrar shall send
a copy of the Ruleset and instructions explaining how to
receive the Public Forum to that Registrant As Soon As
Possible.

A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.

A person is registered as a Player when e is a Registrant who
has specified an Agora nickname to use which is not currently
being used by any other Player and has received a copy of the
Ruleset; this Rule defers to Rules which would prevent such a
Registration.

A Player may be identified for whatever purpose by any
unambiguous way of identification.  A person's Agora nickname
is such an identification.

When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.
======================================================================

The effect of this is to make it obvious that all players have received a
copy of the ruleset... and there is the obvious rearrangement of the rule.
It adds an extra step in registration, but it's one that can be bypassed in
one message: I have received the rules, my nickname is Vir, I wish to
register.  You must be a Registrant in order to register for play, so the
Registrar's duties will always be needed.

I didn't know whether or not I needed to include the phrase "Failure to do
so is a class x crime, etc."... that's why it's a proto, however :)

[etc.]

"is registering" and "is registered" are potentially ambiguous, IMO.  (Game
Custom has it that the intent of a Rule's author has low importance in that
Rule's interpretation.)  How about this?

     A person becomes a Proto-Player when e sends a message to the PF
     requesting Registration.  (However, a person who is currently a Player
     cannot become a Proto-Player.)

     When a person becomes a Proto-Player, the Registrar shall ASAP send
     em the Welcome Pack, consisting of a copy of the Ruleset and an
     explanation of how to receive messages sent to the PF.

     A Proto-Player becomes a Player when e has received the Welcome Pack,
     is able to receive messages sent to the PF, and sends a message to the
     PF stating that e has met these conditions.

What if e doesn't?  Does the Ruleset lose power for those Players to
whom the Rulekeepor illegally fails to make it available?

For reference, here's the relevant part of R1504 again:

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

I have already addressed this question in an aside I made in my
Judgement of CFJ 937, which I'll simply reproduce below:

      "[It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504:
      it's not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the
      report of the gain in Blots have to be made in the same
      message, or whether the report of gain in Blots can follow the
      report of the Infraction by up to seven days. The first
      sentence of R1504 states that "Penalties for Infractions are
      applied immediately upon their legal report". But the legal
      report of what: the penalties or the infractions? If
      infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension with itself,
      since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other Rules,
      eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later than
      the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
      penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty
      is reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is
      reported.]"

I therefore urge the Herald to deny this Claim, on the grounds that
R1504 does not require that penalties for Infractions be applied
immediately upon the legal report of the Infraction, but only upon
the legal report of the penalty.

Before anyone starts transferring Kudos away from me for not also

Crito's message denying Morendil's Claims.
