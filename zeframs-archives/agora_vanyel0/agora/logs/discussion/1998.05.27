I'm trying to find a good example within this metaphor. Perhaps a shot
clock violation. That's certainly not "forbidden" or prohibited by the
rules of basketball; it's simply a (lack of) action for which you are
penalized. 

>What, and not penalize them? It's too late for that. 

No: prohibit *and* penalize them.

I don't see any reason why agreements should be required to be SLCs,
though.

SLC's are a mechanism that's already in place, which could be used for
agreements, but it's true there's no reason why we couldn't set up a more
streamlined and/or generalized version of "agreements" in the Rules that gets
proper authority to enforce provisions with Orders.

IMHO, I don't see why personal agreements need to be acknoledged by the
Rules at all.

IMO, if you want to give individual Players the authority to issue binding
orders to enforce the terms of a personal agreement, the Rules need to
acknowledge the existence of personal agreements as a source of that authority.
 By "binding order" I mean an order that carries a Rule based (in-game) penalty
for non-compliance.

What I was getting at is I don't think the Rules need to intrude upon
personal agreements at all, especially insofar as Orders are concerned.
I'm only recognizing the mechanism in my Order fix because it is in
place and its existence should be subject to a separate debate.

Why is there a need for this?  I think this game is intimate enough that
the social sanctions for flouting an agreement are much more effective
than any "legal" enforcements. . .  I really suspect that this segment
of the rules will lay dormant until some misunderstanding erupts between
a few players and the issue gets dragged into the courts.  Such an event
would probably so acid and nasty that it would immediately result in
loud calls for the repeal of this whole "personal agreement" structure.

I think that the only "agreements" that the Rules should recognize are
those "agreements" that are structured in the Rules themselves.  The
existing law is so loose that it is quite possible that a number of
players have already entered into legally binding agreements without
realizing it. I don't think this is a Good Thing.

Re: DIS: BUS: Kudo transfer 

Actually, I think Swann and I are on the same wavelength here.  Either keep
personal agreements and their enforcement totally on a meta-game level, or
bring them totally under the scope of the Rules, so it is clear that the
authority of such agreements to compell action (or inaction) comes from the
Rules.  While I don't have Swann's (apparent) preference as to which way to go
with this, I do agree that the half-way position we seem to have now is not a
Good Thing.

BTW, I use "meta-game" here to mean outside the Rules, but not necessarily
outside of in-game ("role-playing") activity.  Maybe I'm misusing the term, and
I should use some other terminology for a "Rule/extra-Rule" dichotomy that is
orthogonal to the "game/meta-game" dichotomy?

What I was getting at is I don't think the Rules need to intrude upon
personal agreements at all, especially insofar as Orders are concerned.
I'm only recognizing the mechanism in my Order fix because it is in
place and its existence should be subject to a separate debate.

Why is there a need for this?  I think this game is intimate enough that
the social sanctions for flouting an agreement are much more effective
than any "legal" enforcements. . .  I really suspect that this segment
of the rules will lay dormant until some misunderstanding erupts between
a few players and the issue gets dragged into the courts.  Such an event
would probably so acid and nasty that it would immediately result in
loud calls for the repeal of this whole "personal agreement" structure.

I think that the only "agreements" that the Rules should recognize are
those "agreements" that are structured in the Rules themselves.  The
existing law is so loose that it is quite possible that a number of
players have already entered into legally binding agreements without
realizing it. I don't think this is a Good Thing.

Ugh. I have been working on a proto to (among other fixes) pragmatise
Plots, and I have realised what a complex issue it is. Creation and
destruciton is easy enough, but transfer is a bit tricky. As R1843 stands,
I don't see anything which prvents the Chancellor, on behalf of the Bank,
from transferring all Plots in the Bank to any player e chooses.

I don't want to have to completely reporoduce the Transfer Order system
for Plots, but I am not sure what is the neatest way to pragmatise this.
I don't see any need for Payment Orders for Plots. The only time a Player's
Plots are forcibly taken away from em is when a Win By Monopoly occurs,
which I imagine will be rare.

If anyone cares (which I am doubting, since no-one has responded to any
of my earlier posts about these bugs), I will be posting a working copy
of my proto to invite comment soon.
