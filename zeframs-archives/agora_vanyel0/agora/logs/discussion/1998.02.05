Interestingly, when we had a currency called Marks, their Recordkeepor was
known as the Banker, and not the Bankor. Of course, we abolished Marks soon
after I showed up, so I never got a chance to change it...

Consider the following:

 Rule 693/3 (Power=1)
 Prescribed Voting Period

       The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
       beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
       Players.

Is "distribution to all players" to be considered when the player
making the Proposal sends a message to the business list asking for
the Promotor to make it official, or when the Promotor sends it out to
all players a few days later?  It seems that it could be interpreted
either way (I have a reason for asking this).

The act of "distributing a Proposal" can only be carried out by the Promotor,
so it is the second of the two above interpretations that is correct.

Proto-Proposal

Create a Rule titled "Skill Points" with the following text:

           Each Player shall have associated with em a value called  
      Voting Skill.  The initial value is zero.
           Each Player shall have associated with em a value called  
      Proposing Skill.  The initial value is zero.
           Whenever a Proposal passes, each Player that voted For    
      it in the final tally shall have eir Voting Skill increased    
      by one.  Whenever a Proposal passes, each Player that voted    
      Against it in the final tally shall have eir Voting Skill      
      decreased by one.  Whenever a Proposal fails, each Player that 
      voted For it in the final tally shall have eir Voting Skill    
      decreased by one.  Whenever a Proposal fails, each Player that 
      voted Against it in the final tally shall have eir Voting      
      Skill increased by one.
           Whenever a Proposal passes, the Proposer shall have eir   
      Proposing Skill increased by one.  Whenever a Proposal fails,  
      the Proposer shall have eir Proposing Skill decreased by one.
           Both Voting and Proposing Skills may have values below    
      zero.

*******************************************************************

     Do you think this mechanism has any merit?  I'm not sure what
the benefits/hindrances should be for having high/low Skill Scores,
though.  It seems that Players with a high Voting Skill should have
eir Votes be worth more... maybe...?  And Players with a high
Proposing Skill would have a higher chance of eir Proposals passing.
     It just something I'm tinkering around with.
     Any comments?

Experience has shown that one has to be very careful giving away
rewards on failed proposals, lest Terrible Proposal type scams come about.
Not that I'm saying it can't be done at all, just that one has to
be very careful in doing so.

A few things come to mind:

   1.) You'll definitely want to specify which Office keeps track
       of the Skill scores.  I don't know if this would merit its
       own Office or not.
   2.) You also will probably want to format the actual text to
       fit that of other proposals (no identations, etc.) for
       comformity's sake.

That being said, I would happily vote for a revised form of this
proto-proposal.  I like the idea behind it.

There is no legal requirement to post Transfer Orders to the Public
Forum.  It is possible (in fact, probable) that you have in fact
transferred two P-Notes to Oerjan.

of the minority.

Same thing.  Both suggestions favor entrenching power in the hands of
people who are good at gathering power.  You suggest a positive
feedback loop, which, as anyone who does systems control knows, will
force the system into the most extreme state possible over time.
