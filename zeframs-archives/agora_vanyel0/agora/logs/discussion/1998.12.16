That's a somewhat misleading way of describing the situation, which is
that you have no actual evidence that Crito is the Justiciar at all.
What you have is Crito's claim to remember sending his consent to be
appointed to the Public Forum, a claim which Crito himself admits might
be mistaken, and which is contradicted by your own records and memory of
the situation. So, the preponderance of the evidence is at best neutral
on the question, and may actually favour the opposite conclusion, that
Morendil is the Justiciar.

Are Morendil and Scott still archiving all three lists? Can either of
them settle this question definitively? (eGroups.com has still not fixed
whatever it is that is preventing agora-business and agora-discussion
posts from being archived.)

I have that in mind. I have been trying to determine, without much 
success, if the Rules impose a time limit on when Elections should
be held when an Officer is not an Electee. Anybody have an idea ?

Yes, precisely!  Thank you for such a succinct clarification of what I

I think so.  Sounds like something that should have an ASAP requirement.

I agree that's a weakness of R790. But are you seriously arguing that
the announcement of an election can be delayed infinitely, without
breaking R790? R790 does require the Registrar to do something.

I'd even argue that there is overwhelming game custom that in the
absence of explicit time limits things should be done within a week,
because that is the limit in nearly all cases where time limits are
explicit. We have even voted to reduce the voting period to seven
days, and mentioned explicitly as an argument for this change that it
brings the voting period in line with the rest of the timing
requirements in our rules.

No, I'm not arguing that e can delay it infinitely, but the Rules do fail
to set a particular time limit, so e can delay it indefinitely without 
technically breaking R790.  I think we have had a discussion about
this kind of thing before, but I don't remember anyone coming to
a conclusion about when you can prove that you've broken the Rules
by failing to fulfill an obligation with no specified time limit.  In my opinion,
the problem is that as soon as you make your CFJ alleging such a Rule
has been broken, you have put a fixed point in time against which the
defendant can successfully argue, "I haven't done it yet, but I can do it
tomorrow, so I haven't broken the Rule yet".  (At least e can logically,
if not successfully, argue this every time you make such a CFJ).
I think you are correct that game custom has placed a kind of loose
application of ASAP on these obligations, but I'm not sure that could
really stand up in court.

Hmm.  I just had a thought (don't know if it's any good).  You might be able
to slap a Rule breaking penalty on an Officer who delays such an
obligation for their entire term of Office, i.e. e can be prosecuted for this
once e is out of Office.  I'll have to think about it some more.

You could always use Rule 1509 to get a Judicial Order compelling that
Player to conduct the Election.

I knew I wasn't the first but I thought that since I was involved in the
creation of the Rule that my null proposal it might spark a movement to
remove this 'feature' of the Rule.

Excellent.  I've also been thinking that perhaps some officer might be given
the right to declare a Player's Duty to have been satisfied.  Perhaps we
could give this to the Speaker so that e can recognize other ways of
contributing to the game.  Of course it would be possible only once a month.

I like that idea. But if you are going to further complicate this Office,
I ask again that you move it away from the Promotor, who has to produce
four Reports a week as it is. Steve is right that it is less extra load
for the Promotor than for any other Player, but it is extra load on an
already well loaded Office.
