As I've already pointed out to Blob, I don't think you can do that.
R106: "All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon."
This takes precedence over R1774.

>(Personally, I find that usage extremely grating.)

My understanding of the issue is that, historically speaking, the usage
of 'they' as a gender-neutral singular pronoun was widespread and accepted
prior to, and even well into, the 19th century. Its use was condemned by
presciptive grammarians in that century for reasons which had little to
do with correct grammar, and probably more to do with class snobbery.
Twentieth century grammarians are more sophisticated and this use of
'they' is slowly but surely being revived.
