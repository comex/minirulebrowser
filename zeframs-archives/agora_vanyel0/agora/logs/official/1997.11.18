In the matter of the Appeal of CFJ 1068, I hereby overturn elJefe's
Judgement and rule that the Statement is TRUE.

I am almost entirely in agreement in with Judge Kolja concerning
this case. I have little of substance to add to his excellent
remarks on how the requirement that Probate be carried out 'in a
timely manner' is to be understood. I would add only that we
need not think that 'in a timely manner' needs to be understood as
referring to the same length of time in every case. We might think
in one case that eight weeks is time enough, but think differently
in another due to extenuating circumstances. These remarks are
consistent with Kolja's, but I thought it worth making them more
explicit.

My disagreement with Kolja arises only in the final step of his
reasoning, ie the application of R1575. I have been following events
reasonably closely, and I am quite satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that Harlequin has not undertaken to dispose of Antimatter's assets
and debts in accordance with the Probate Code in a timely manner.
He is therefore in violation of R1738. 

I note that the infection of R908 saves Harlequin from having
to make a Formal Apology. I also note, in respect of R1439, that
the Caller of the CFJ, Antimatter, is not a Player.

This message constitutes the termination of Swann's Probate, in
accordance with the procedures set out in the Probate Code, R1739.

Section 1. General

There are no Payment Orders naming Swann as Payor or Payee currently
in dispute.

Section 2. Procedure for Fair Division

2a. Voting Tokens

Assessor General Chaos reports that Swann has assets of 10.0 Voting
Tokens. Swann has no VT-Creditors, so the steps in 2.1-2.3 do not
apply. Since Swann's estate is not terminal, I am not authorized to
destroy any of Swann's residual VT assets.

2b. Indulgences

Herald Crito reports that Swann has no Indulgences, nor any Indulgence-
Creditors.

2c. Proposal Notes

Herald Crito reports that Swann has no Proposal Notes. He does have
P-Note-Creditors and Debtors. These are dealt with below.

Section 3. Distribution of Assets to Creditors

Swann has no assets of any Currency for which he has Creditors.

Section 4. Reassignment of Credits to Creditors

Herald Crito reports that the Bank owes Swann 4 P-Notes, and that
Swann owes the Bank 3 P-Notes. As near as I can determine from the
opaque language of R1739, I think this means I have to execute a
Transfer Order from the Bank (as Debtor) to the Bank (as Creditor)
for an amount of 3 P-Notes, which I hereby do. There is a surplus
of 1 P-Note, owed to Swann from the Bank. I hereby execute a
Transfer Order from the Bank to Swann for the amount of 1 P-Note.
Further, I hereby vacate all the Payment Orders for P-Notes
naming Swann as Payor or Payee. This completes, I fervently pray,
the requirements of Section 4.

Section 5. Discharge of Residual Debts

Swann has no residual debts.

Section 6. Distribution of Residual Assets to Heirs
Section 7. Remission of Unclaimed Assets
Section 8. Destruction of Immobile Assets

All these Sections are skipped because Swann is not a terminal estate.

Section 9. Termination of Probate

I announce that Probate of Swann's estate is complete.

======================================================================
Injunction:

The Rulekeepor is hereby enjoined to annotate Rule 1558 with the
Statement of this CFJ and the list of Relevant Rules as noted in the
CFJ.


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I'll take the unusual step of presenting arguments for both sides. I'm
not really advocating any particular Judgement. I just think the matter
should be resolved one way or the other. I'll leave it to the Judge
to decide which e prefers. Perhaps the Judge will find some new
argument which I haven't thought of to resolve the matter.

R1647 states:

      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

while R1558 states:

      No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
      the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

On the side of a Judgement of TRUE, we have the observation that
if a Player who is the Speaker were still to be Speaker when e
was Elected Speaker-Elected, e would not be permitted to hold the
Office, even temporarily. This seems to show that the Speaker
cannot nominate for Speaker-Elect.

On the other hand, however, how can we be sure that the Player
who is Speaker would still be Speaker when the Election for the
Office of Speaker-Elect concluded? If the Player had somehow
ceased to be Speaker, nothing would prevent em from holding the
Office of Speaker-Elect, were e to win the Election. And it is not
difficult to imagine ways in which the a Player who is the Speaker
might cease to be Speaker in time take up the Office of Speaker-Elect.
Here are three:

1. By proposal. From the call for Nominations to the announcement of
the results, an Election in which there are multiple Candidates takes
at least two weeks to complete. In that time, a high-Powered Rule
might be be adopted removing the Player from the position of Speaker.

2. By giving up the Speakership voluntarily. Although R681 prevents
a Speaker who gives up the Speakership voluntarily from nominating
emself for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Rule does not say that
the Speaker may not already be nominated at the time e gives up
the Speakership.

3. By going On Hold. Eir doing so would constitute the Crime of
Speaker Inactivity (see R1375), with the quite heavy penalties
entailed by this, but that would not make em ineligible to hold the
Office of Speaker-Elect.

Whether the Judge finds these latter considerations persuasive will
largely depend on how e chooses to construct the phrase 'would not
be permitted to hold the Office'. If e chooses to read it 'would
*certainly* not be permitted to hold the Office', then I think a
Judgement of FALSE is indicated, since I think I've shown above
that we cannot be certain that a Player who is the Speaker would
not be permitted to hold the Office of Speaker-Elect were e Elected
to that Office. On the other hand, if e chooses to read it as 'would
not be permitted to hold the Office, other things being equal' then
a Judgement of TRUE is indicated, since all of the possibilites I've
raised fall into the category of other things not being equal.


======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments of Judge:

This case presents the question of whether the sitting Speaker may be
Nominated in an Election for the Office of Speaker-Elect, on the basis
of Rules 1558 and 1647.  Petitioner presents arguments both for and
against holding such a Nomination as legal.  This Court find that Rule
1558 is ambiguous on the question, but categorically bars such
Nominations on the grounds that failing to categorically bar them
would potentially require future knowledge in order to distinguish
legal Nominations.

This Court finds that the pertinent sentence of Rule 1558, "No Player
may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold the Office which
the Election is seeking to fill," is insufficiently specified.  There
appear to be two plausible constructions of this sentence.  It could
mean "No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
the Office ... _if Elected_."  It could also mean "No Player may be
Nominated who would not be permitted to hold the Office ... _at the
moment of the attempted Nomination_."  The first construction seems
slightly slightly favorable to the second, but not compellingly so.  A
consideration of both is therefore in order.

The first construction would permit the Speaker to Nominate for
Speaker-Elect, as long as the Speaker ensures that e is not Speaker by
the time the Election ends.  Petitioner mentions several possible ways
in which this might happen, but neglects to mention the case of the
Speaker being Tainted.  If the Speaker is Tainted, then, should e be
Elected, e would immediately cease to be Speaker (and then immediately
become Speaker again).  It becomes an argument of infinitesimal
moments as to whether the Speaker would be forced to be Speaker-Elect
simultaneously in this case, an argument this Court will not pursue at
this time.  In any case, the first construction would allow the
Speaker to Nominate for Speaker-Elect in some situations, and would
therefore mandate a ruling of FALSE.

However, this Court elects to repudiate this construction, because it
would, in many cases, make the legality of a Speaker's Nomination
contigent on future events.  Petitioner suggests that the Speaker
could be made eligible by being removed by Proposal, by surrendering
the Speakership, or by going On Hold.  To have the desired effect, one
of these events would necessarily have to occur after the Nomination,
but before the end of the Election.  Most imporatantly, if none of
these were to occur before the end of the Election, the Speaker would
be ineligible to become Speaker-Elect.  Thus, the legality of the
Nomination, and thus of the Nominee's candidacy, would be contingent
on the necessary event occuring.  It is this Court's opinion that
basing the legality of an action on future events is neither
consistent with commonsense nor in keeping with the best interest of
the Game, and so this construction should be disallowed if an
alternative exists.

The second construction, fortunately, is void of this need for
precognition.  The legality of a Nomination, under this construction,
can be determined at the moment it is made.  In this Court's opinion,
this advantage is more than sufficient to outweigh the Court's
admittedly minor concerns about the obviousness of this construction.

Since this Court's preferred construction of Rule 1558 acts to
categorically bar any Nomination by the Speaker in any Election for
the Officer of Speaker-Elect, the question presented is categorically
true.  Therefore:

Judgement of TRUE is entered.  The Injunction requested is GRANTED,
and the Rulekeepor is hereby enjoined to annotate Rule 1558 with the
Statement of this CFJ and the list of Relevant Rules as noted in the
CFJ.

======================================================================

Caller's Arguments:

Okay, I'll admit it, I'm too lazy to go through and exhaustively
check the ruleset, but I'm pretty sure that Harlequin is guilty of
not completed my Probate in a timely fashion. Therefore, in order to
attempt to get out of Probate in time to reregister sometime soon, I
make the following CFJ (even though I doubt it will help much):

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I find that when Antimatter deregistered on 10 September he had no
currencies of any kind (noone did).  Thus he was never placed in Probate by
Rule 1601.  Unless the Rules authorize the Notary to place people into
Probate arbitrarily, or to appoint an EiP for entities not in Probate
(which I doubt), I find that the Notary's attempted appointment of
Harlequin as EiP had no effect.

Thus Harlequin is not an Executor in Probate for Antimatter.

I do note that Morendil _did_ possess currencies when he was deregistered,
and so Harlequin's appointment as EiP for Morendil (on 27 October) was
effective.

Though the actions required of the EiP are straightforward, I find that
Rule 1738 requires "timely" action rather than "as soon as possible".  It
would be unreasonable to hold that 8 days of inaction was a violation.
Thus Harlequin did not violate Rule 1738 here either.


======================================================================
Decision of the Speaker:

A brief review of the facts is in order. Player Antimatter
deregistered on Sep. 10 of this year. Player Harlequin was assigned
as Antimatter's Executor in Probate on Sep. 11; having not, as far
as I can determine, made any particular effort to carry out eir
duties as Antimatter's Executor in Probate, Harlequin went On Hold on
Nov. 5, shortly after this CFJ was Called on Nov. 4 by Antimatter,
who was not at this time a Player.

The issue at hand is, therefore, whether the period of time between
Sep. 11 and Nov. 4 - roughly, two months - constituted a sufficient
amount of time to carry out the duties normally required of an
Executor in Probate, in which case it would be fair to Judge the CFJ
TRUE.

I would normally consider a two-month period amply sufficient to
carry out nearly any duty that the Rule currently impose on Players.
However, Rule 1575 places quite stringent standards of proof on a
Judge deciding on the matter a Rule violation.

In this instance, I find that there are several reasons why a period
of two months may not be considered "beyond reasonable doubt"
sufficient to carry out an Executor in Probate's duties. First and
foremost, not one EiP has at this time completed the duties required
of em, and some have been assigned to their respective estates for
periods of the same order. Second, and more peripheral, no Rule
currently provides an adequate method for determining what period of
time "in a timely manner" could refer to. Absent such definitions, I
would consider one or more instances of Executors in Probate
completing their duties in a period of two months or less
satisfactory evidence to Judge TRUE, but that is not the case.

For these reasons, and while noting that Judge's elJefe rests on
flawed premises, I hereby Sustain the original Judgement.

Rule 1575/0 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.



======================================================================
Decision of pro-CotC Kolja A.:

The first judge's argument that Harlequin wasn't really Antimatter's
EiP is false because it overlooks the last paragraph of 1601.

The appeal judgement therefore has to focus on the question whether
Harlequin has performed eir duties in a "timely" manner as required by
1738.

However, "timely" is not defined precisely anywhere, and is thus open
to judicial interpretation. I will have to try and help develope a
sensible precedent in this judgement.


1. Which time span should be considered to determine the timeliness of
actions?

The rules do define "as soon as possible" as a possible timing
requirement, of one week. Clearly, "timely" is a more loose
requirement than ASAP, so the time allowed must be significantly more
than one week.

Therefore, as far as Harlequin's EiP-ship of Morendil is concerned, e
certainly didn't violate 1738.

Other time delays implemented in the rules are from 96 hours (delay
between going on hold and off hold again, 1016) up to one month
(necessary delay before reregistering after being declared lawless,
1714). The time scale on which the game is proceeding is therefore one
of several weeks. The rules usually give players about one week
(delivering judgement) to 10 days (voting period) to perform tasks
that players usually want to perform, but can decline or ignore if
they want. "Timely", as a requirement clearly meant to be more loose
than other requirements in the rules, should therefore be interpreted
as a reference to a time of several weeks, possibly but not
necessarily up to two months.

This also makes sense in the issue at hand: while the EiP-ship can
also be declined (the EiP can resign from this duty, 1738), one may at
least give a newly appointed EiP some weeks to assess the situation of
the estate in probate and perform eir duties as required - or find out
that this is too much work for em, and resign as a consequence.

Of course, this CFJ concerns a time span of about two months (this is
how long Harlequin was EiP of Antimatter when this CFJ was made),
which is just a borderline case - had it been 3 or 4 weeks, or 3
months, the decision would have been easier.

Even if the time scale associated with the "timely" requirement is
fixed as "several weeks to two months", of course 1738 cannot be
interpreted as a requirement to _complete_ the termination of the
estate in probate in this time: there may be longwinded affairs of
disputed POs, unclear situations and, possibly, corresponding CFJs
involved. However, 1738 may safely be interpreted as the requirement
to _begin_ with the termination of the estate within such a time
frame.


2. The second question therefore is, did Harlequin make reasonable
attempts to perform eir duties according to 1738?

This is where, in this judge's opinion and within eir horizon, this
CFJ covers new ground in Agora's judicial history: In other judgements
all I need to be able to judge is a short description of the situation
and the rules. The issues normally are ones of rule interpretation.

The present case is more concerned with an assessment of a players
behavior, not a rules interpretation. Here, I'd really like to give
the accused a chance to defend emself and explain why e didn't do
anything visible to start doing eir job as EiP, and whether e did do
some things I just missed or never became aware of. However, with
Harlequin on hold and the limited time I have available for delivering
my judgement, I can not give Harlequin this chance the way I'd really
like to. [Side note: Maybe for "criminal cases" like this a different
procedure would be appropriate, with enough time and, possibly, more
detailed procedures for hearing both sides of the case.]

>From the information I have available, and the silence of the accused
so far, I would tend to judge true, assuming that Harlequin did not
even begin to do eir duties (or resign eir EiP-ship) within the two
months after eir assignment.

However, 1575 prescribes a very high standard of certainty required to
judge a CFJ as the present one TRUE. Because the time frame in
question is so close to the borderline of what I would call "timely",
and because I feel that the evidence available to me may not be quite
complete, I cannot judge this CFJ TRUE.


Although for different reasons, I therefore sustain the original
judgement of FALSE by elJefe.


======================================================================
Decision of the Justiciar:

In the matter of the Appeal of CFJ 1068, I hereby overturn elJefe's
Judgement and rule that the Statement is TRUE.

I am almost entirely in agreement in with Judge Kolja concerning
this case. I have little of substance to add to his excellent
remarks on how the requirement that Probate be carried out 'in a
timely manner' is to be understood. I would add only that we
need not think that 'in a timely manner' needs to be understood as
referring to the same length of time in every case. We might think
in one case that eight weeks is time enough, but think differently
in another due to extenuating circumstances. These remarks are
consistent with Kolja's, but I thought it worth making them more
explicit.

My disagreement with Kolja arises only in the final step of his
reasoning, ie the application of R1575. I have been following events
reasonably closely, and I am quite satisfied beyond reasonable doubt
that Harlequin has not undertaken to dispose of Antimatter's assets
and debts in accordance with the Probate Code in a timely manner.
He is therefore in violation of R1738.

I note that the infection of R908 saves Harlequin from having
to make a Formal Apology. I also note, in respect of R1439, that
the Caller of the CFJ, Antimatter, is not a Player.
