OFF:  New Proposals: 3633-3638

There are six new proposals distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
E = Emergency
 
D  3633 Chuck      1 Repeal Rule Attributions
D  3634 Steve      1 Permanent Public Voting
D  3635 G. Chaos   1 Simplify Judicial Salaries
D  3636 G. Chaos   1 Probate, Take Two
D  3637 Blob       1 Perpetual Offices
D  3638 Michael    1 Repeal the Virus.

======================================================================
Proposal 3633 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Rule Attributions 

Rule 1667 ("Origination of Rules") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1668 ("Authorship of Rules") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1669 ("Rule Attributions") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1681 ("The Logical Rulesets") is hereby amended by
deleting the line which reads

        * The Attribution of each Rule

[Comment: I see little or no benefit to these.  Note that I am
not proposing to amend R1430, which will continue to require the
Rulekeepor to note the proposer of each proposed Rule Change in
the historical annotations.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3634 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Permanent Public Voting

Be it hereby resolved that R1741 be amended by deleting from it the text
which reads:

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

======================================================================
Proposal 3635 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Simplify Judicial Salaries

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

[Simplifies matters considerably.  The "within one week" is used
 instead of ASAP to allow the CotC to batch salary payments together
 instead of having to do them in strict ASAP order.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3636 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Probate, Take Two 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.
 
      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1745 be repealed.

[An entity possessing stranded Currencies is placed in Probate
 instead.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or 
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.  

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

======================================================================
Proposal 3637 (Blob)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.  

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

======================================================================
Proposal 3638 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal the Virus.

Be it hereby resolved that rule 1454 "The Virus" be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ As I won't be paying a proposal fee for this proposal, it will
  likely be Disinterested as a result.  Basically I'm sick of the
  Virus. It's done enough damage now and demonstrated its potential
  for long enough.  I think we're more than capable of getting
  ourselves into messes without having to resort to a random number
  generator.

  When, for example, are we going to see Plots proposed?  The authors
  claim that things need to settle down before this happens.
  Personally, I can't see the point in waiting for quiescence ("STASIS
  means death!" as our friend Frankenstein might say), but perhaps
  repealing the Virus will help them get round to it. ]

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Proposal 3537 (Steve) (adopted Thu, 24 Jul 1997 16:26:59 -0500)
Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1623 be amended by deleting from it
the text:

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3538 (Steve) (adopted Thu, 24 Jul 1997 16:26:59 -0500)
Restore Game Balance II

[Comment: with the Judgement of CFJ 928, and the reversal of the
transfers which occurred subsequent to the passage of P3482, we
have returned to the absurdly VT-abundant environment (there are
now over 7700 VTs in circulation) which that Proposal sought,
unsuccessfully as it turned out, to correct. This time, I'm taking
no chances; I'm making RGBII enact a self-repealing Rule.]

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Restore Game Balance II",
be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the following changes to Nomic
      Properties take place:

      (1) the number of Voting Tokens in the Bank is increased by
          the total number of Voting Tokens possessed by all Contests,
          and the number of Voting Tokens held by each Contest is
          adjusted to zero;

      (2) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Player who
          possesses more than 200 Voting Tokens is adjusted to be
          200, and to each decrease in the Voting Tokens possessed
          by these Players caused by this adjustment there corresponds 
          an equivalent increase in the number of Voting Tokens held
          by the Bank;

      (3) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Entity other
          than the Bank is adjusted to be one tenth of its previous
          value, and to each such decrease caused by this adjustment
          there corresponds an equivalent increase in the number of
          Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by any Player 
          after the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5,
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by that Player is
          adjusted to be 5, and to each such increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      All adjustments required by this Rule are detected and reported by
      the Assessor. This Rule shall repeal itself when the adjustments
      required by it are reported by the Assessor in the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3543 (Harlequin) (Disinterested) 
  (adopted Sun, 17 Aug 1997 18:04:20 -0500)
Pragmatic and *Functional* Currencies

Let Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate") be
amended to read:

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is
      the Herald. The Mintor of Indulgences is the Bank.

      A Payment Order for 1 Indulgence, the payee of which is the
      Bank, is called a Blot.  When a Rule states that a Player is to
      gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall be executed
      with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee, and for a
      number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that Player
      is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever is
      required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated or satisfied).  
      A Player with no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a 
      Win-Preventing condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Amend Rule 1712  ("Distribution of Indulgences") to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly 
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of 
      Blots executed in the past Week, minus the number of Blots 
      vacated in the past Week, among all Players: for each such 
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and 
      issue a Payment Order from the Bank to that Player for one
      Indulgence.

Let Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended by replacing the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, and
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.

with the text:

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a currency, their MUQ is one, 
      their Recordkeepor is the Promotor, and their Mintor is the
      Bank.

Amend Rule 1579 ("Mintors") by adding the text:

      All Players have Mint Authority.

after the sentence reading:

      The Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce 
      when this happens.

The Promotor's Report of Sun, 20 Jul 1997 19:59:11 -0500 is ratified.

The Herald's Report of Mon, 21 Jul 1997 11:34:34 -0400 is ratified.

Amend Rule 1727 ("Happy Birthday") by changing the word "BIrth" to
"Birthday."

======================================================================

Texts of Adopted Proposals between 3555 through 3599 omitted.

======================================================================

Proposal 3601 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Read the Ruleset Week

A rule shall be created with the Title "Read the Ruleset Week" and
text as follows:

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

[There's part of me that would rather do it sooner, but December
is already getting into holidays, not to mention finals for those
of us who are students, and many players are away in the early part of
January.  Anyway, I think it would be good to encourage players to
read the whole entire Ruelset at least once a year.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3602 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Stars and Stripes Forever

A Rule shall be created with the Title "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
and text as follows:

      When Rule 1776 is created, the Rulekeepor shall pay out, to
      the Entity which proposed the Proposal which created Rule 1776,
      13 VTs.  Once that has taken place, this Rule repeals itself.

      If Rule 1776 is not created by a Proposal, this Rule repeals
      itself upon creation of Rule 1776.

[I welcome similar proposals recognizing other nations.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3603 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Innocent Error Defense

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3604 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Allow Mandated Vacation

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "If a Player who ..." with

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it, unless e was
      required by the Rules to vacate that particular Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3605 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No Doubling-Up 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      A given Transfer Order may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3606 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify PI Infraction

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended by replacing "Each
Recordkeeper is authorized to report this Infraction, which" with "The
Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this Infraction
with respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor.  This
Infraction"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3607 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Groups

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by replacing the
string "An SLC associated with a Group is that Group's Ordinances"
with "Each Group has associated with it an SLC called its Ordinances."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3608 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Vizier Specification

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 721 be amended to read:

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Vizier shall be
      the Player who authored the ACO that created that Group, if e is
      still a Member of that Group.  If the Group was not created by
      the Execution of a ACO, the Vizier shall be whoever was the
      Vizier of that Group when it was first created.  

      If the Vizier thus specified is not a Member of the Group, the
      Group shall be dissolved.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 721 be retitled "The Vizier and the
Ordinancekeepor".

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created with the following text:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.

[The current Rule 721 contains a terrible sentence fragment;
 furthermore, it has two basically unrelated provisions (Vizier and
 Ordinancekeepor, and Group Voting) lumped together into a single
 Rule.  This fixes the atrocious grammar and separeates the unrelated
 provisions into separate Rules.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3609 (Steve)  AI = 1
Left In A Huff!

Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann, KoJen, Zefram
and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In A Huff.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3610 (Steve)  AI = 1
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway.] 

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3611 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Probate and Registration 

Amend Rule 1601 (Probate) by changing the paragraph that currently reads      

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

into

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed, or when that entity becomes a Player.

Amend Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) by appending the following
text at the end of the Rule:

      A Player ends being an entity's Executor in Probate if one of 
      the following happens:

      - That entity is not anymore in Probate
      - The Player deregisters or is deregistered
      - A CFJ, alleging that the Player was that entity's Executor
        in Probate for a period of at least one month in which there
        were no disputed Payment Orders having that entity either as
        their payor as their payee, has been found true.

Furthermore, all persons that are not Players cease to be the Executor 
in Probate of any and all entities of which they are the Executor in
Probate.

[ comment: This causes the following:
  1. Non-Players can not be Executors in Probate
  2. Players can not be in Probate
  3. the 'timely manner' in which a Probate must be solved has been
     specified - one month, but only if there are no disputed Payment
     Orders naming the entity in Probate.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3612 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Repeal-O-Matic II

Create a rule with the following text;
{Title: Repeal-O-Matic}

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3614 (Crito)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Persistent Style

Amend Rule 1542 to read as follows:

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir current
      High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be increased by two
      times the number of P-Notes awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

Amend Rule 1543 to read as follows:

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
       iii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The change in Style, if any, merited by each Proposal
            distributed since the last Wizard's Report.
         v) The reasons for each change.

Repeal Rule 1705

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3616 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Nonchallenge of Election Results

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3618 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Fix Indulgence Distribution

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

[This was "adopted" during the VT-Free Era.]

Proposal 3619 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If an entity transfers Currency to the Bank without specifying a
      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

Proposal 3622 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No nonplayer responsibilities

Create a rule reading:

When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate, officer,
judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy any role or position
to which a Rule assigns any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered
may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules
which would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent Titles, or
any position which a Rule specifically says may be held by a non-Player,
nor shall it act to prevent a nonPlayer from registering, calling CFJs, or
doing things that nonPlayers generally are able to do.
