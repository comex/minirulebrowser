1. RECENT EVENTS
=======================================================================

1997-10-14T09:22:37Z (Tue)
  Swann is deregistered.

1997-10-14T10:37:24Z (Tue)
  Morendil is deregistered.

1997-10-14T15:16:40Z (Tue)
  Antimatter deregisters.

1997-10-14T17:04:49Z (Tue)
  Proposals 3555-3568 distributed.

As of this message:
  >D  3555 Steve    1 A Public Voting Experiment
  Style: no change

  I've awarded this proposal style in the past.

  >D  3556 Steve    1 Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed 
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3557 Steve    1 A Win by Bribery for Steve
  Style: +2

  Very clever.  I'm not convinced that the purported fix is really good,
  but it appears adequate for the moment.

  >D  3558 G. Chaos 1 Contract Law
  Style: -3

  We've had quite enough of copying RL law already.  -2 for that, because
  this is such a drastic example of the genre.  A further -1 for extreme
  Jurism and woolly definitions.

  *** General Chaos is awarded the Patent Title of Boor

  >D  3559 Murphy   1 Clarify Judge Eligibility
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3560 Murphy   1 Clarify Movement
  Style: -1

  It probably will work in practice, but doesn't rule out moves to
  non-Locations by mechanisms other than the one define in that Rule.
  Also does nothing about the Player already at a non-Location.

  *** Murphy is awarded the Patent Title of Boor

  >D  3561 Oerjan   1 Exorcise Probate
  Style: +1

  Nicely worded, and fits in with the rest of the Rule well.

  >D  3562 Oerjan   1 Patent Title for Andre
  Style: +1

  Mirrors 's habit in a pleasantly surreal manner.  <player> should have
  actually Proposed eir other suggested Patent Title.

  >D  3563 G. Chaos 1 (untitled)
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3564 G. Chaos 1 Fix Acclamation Timing
  Style: no change

  Could be done better.

  >D  3565 G. Chaos 1 Revise Applications
  Style: no change

  Would have been +1 but for omitting to define `stricken', etc.
  "appear on it" is rather open to interpretation.

  >D  3566 G. Chaos 1 (untitled)
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3567 G. Chaos 1 Liberalize Speaker's Patronage
  Style: -1

  Who says that one unit of any Currency is a reasonable amount?

  >DE 3568 G. Chaos 1 PI Amnesty
  Style: -2

  -1 because it doesn't solve the problem -- the problematic PI
  Infractions have already occurred, and will affect Players as soon
  as they are reported.  A week or two off is of negligible effect.
  A further -1 because it doesn't self-repeal, requiring a second Proposal
  to clean it up.

1997-10-20T14:19:45Z (Mon)
  Proposals 3569-3575 distributed.

As of this message:
  >D  3569 Zefram   1 Fix Currencies
  >D  3570 Zefram   3 No Win Situation 
  Style: no change (Proposed by the Wizard)

  >D  3571 Murphy   1 (untitled)
  Style: -1

  Fine, go ahead, declare it Lost in Space day.  But do it on time.

  >D  3572 Steve    3 Prohibit Retroactivity
  Style: no change

  A clean change.  Nice wording.  But it doesn't prohibit retroactivity.

  >D  3573 Steve    1 Majority Appeal decisions
  Style: no change

  I dislike a lot of the wording.  But I suspend judgement on it,
  because it is all copied from the current version of the Rule.

  >D  3574 Kolja A. 1 Judicial Cleanup
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3575 Kolja A. 1 Fix Internomic referenda
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

1997-10-20T17:59:24Z (Mon)
  Proposal 3576 distributed.

As of this message:
  >D  3576 Zefram   3.1 (untitled)

  Proposals 3555-3568 distributed.

As of this message:
  >D  3555 Steve    1 A Public Voting Experiment
  Style: no change

  I've awarded this proposal style in the past.

  >D  3556 Steve    1 Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed 
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3557 Steve    1 A Win by Bribery for Steve
  Style: +2

  Very clever.  I'm not convinced that the purported fix is really good,
  but it appears adequate for the moment.

  >D  3558 G. Chaos 1 Contract Law
  Style: -3

  We've had quite enough of copying RL law already.  -2 for that, because
  this is such a drastic example of the genre.  A further -1 for extreme
  Jurism and woolly definitions.

  *** General Chaos is awarded the Patent Title of Boor

  >D  3559 Murphy   1 Clarify Judge Eligibility
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3560 Murphy   1 Clarify Movement
  Style: -1

  It probably will work in practice, but doesn't rule out moves to
  non-Locations by mechanisms other than the one define in that Rule.
  Also does nothing about the Player already at a non-Location.

  *** Murphy is awarded the Patent Title of Boor

  >D  3561 Oerjan   1 Exorcise Probate
  Style: +1

  Nicely worded, and fits in with the rest of the Rule well.

  >D  3562 Oerjan   1 Patent Title for Andre
  Style: +1

  Mirrors 's habit in a pleasantly surreal manner.  <player> should have
  actually Proposed eir other suggested Patent Title.

  >D  3563 G. Chaos 1 (untitled)
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3564 G. Chaos 1 Fix Acclamation Timing
  Style: no change

  Could be done better.

  >D  3565 G. Chaos 1 Revise Applications
  Style: no change

  Would have been +1 but for omitting to define `stricken', etc.
  "appear on it" is rather open to interpretation.

  >D  3566 G. Chaos 1 (untitled)
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3567 G. Chaos 1 Liberalize Speaker's Patronage
  Style: -1

  Who says that one unit of any Currency is a reasonable amount?

  >DE 3568 G. Chaos 1 PI Amnesty
  Style: -2

  -1 because it doesn't solve the problem -- the problematic PI
  Infractions have already occurred, and will affect Players as soon
  as they are reported.  A week or two off is of negligible effect.
  A further -1 because it doesn't self-repeal, requiring a second Proposal
  to clean it up.

1997-10-20T14:19:45Z (Mon)
  Proposals 3569-3575 distributed.

As of this message:
  >D  3569 Zefram   1 Fix Currencies
  >D  3570 Zefram   3 No Win Situation 
  Style: no change (Proposed by the Wizard)

  >D  3571 Murphy   1 (untitled)
  Style: -1

  Fine, go ahead, declare it Lost in Space day.  But do it on time.

  >D  3572 Steve    3 Prohibit Retroactivity
  Style: no change

  A clean change.  Nice wording.  But it doesn't prohibit retroactivity.

  >D  3573 Steve    1 Majority Appeal decisions
  Style: no change

  I dislike a lot of the wording.  But I suspend judgement on it,
  because it is all copied from the current version of the Rule.

  >D  3574 Kolja A. 1 Judicial Cleanup
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

  >D  3575 Kolja A. 1 Fix Internomic referenda
  Style: no change

  Trivial.

1997-10-20T17:59:24Z (Mon)
  Proposal 3576 distributed.
