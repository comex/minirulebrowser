77. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Modes of Voting

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing
      mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals, with Support. 

       (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections, with Support. 

       (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

       (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.

 v1.1 - Modified it to use the new "With Support" rule. Removed the
        clause describing timing, as that is covered by "With Support"
        (albeit in a different way).

        I am in the process of bringing the numbering in line with
        Gen Chaos' standard, but I've lost the message in which he
        described it. 

        Removed the final clause as it didn't seem to have any real
        purpose.

78. Proposal by Michael, AI=1
(no title)

That Rule 1854 ("The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary") be
amended to read:

The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary by first announcing
that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that e announces a
value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive.  The change to the Basic
Officer Salary then occurs at the beginning of the next week if the
announcement was made on a Thursday or earlier in the week.  If the
announcement is made later in the week, then the change occurs at the
start of the second week after the announcement. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

84. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
            performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

112. Proposal by Murphy, AI=1
CFJ Tweaks

IAmend Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement) by replacing "Player" with "person".

Amend Rule 897 (Barring Players from Judgement) to read:

      The Caller of a CFJ may Bar up to three Players from Judging that CFJ.

      Any Player whose Executor is the Caller of a CFJ is Barred from
Judging
      that CFJ.

      Any Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that CFJ.

Amend Rule 1562 (Excess CFJs) by replacing this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

with this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      A Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

Amend Rule 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ) to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ or type of CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the
      Courts, specifying the CFJ or type of CFJ for which e wishes to
      be made ineligible.  Such a notice remains in effect until the
      Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no longer in
      effect.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.

113. Proposal by Murphy, AI=1
Legal Briefs

IAmend Rule 1841 (Granting Power of Attorney) to read:

      A Senator may give eir Power of Attorney to another Player for a
      specified time period, by specifying the Player and time period
      in the Public Forum.  To be effective, the time period must be no
      longer than three months, must begin during the week following the
      posting, and the other Player must consent in the Public Forum
      before the time period begins.

      If the grant is effective, then the Player has Power of Attorney
      over the Senator beginning at the specified time.  This grant ends
      when one of the following occurs:

        (a) The specified time period ends.
        (b) The Senator posts in the Public Forum that e withdraws eir
            Power of Attorney.
        (c) Either Player is deregistered or goes On Hold.

Amend Rule 1842 (Power of Attorney) to read:

      While the Rules grant one Player (known as the Holder) Power of
      Attorney over another Player (known as the Grantor), the Holder
      is the sole Executor of the Grantor.

      No Player may have Power of Attorney over more than two Players.

Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for
      collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
      On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
      Bid.

      Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one particular
      currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction Currency is
      the Voting Token.

      Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that an Auction is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the
      Auction Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
      value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
      is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
      during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
      Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
      particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
      valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the
              Auction, or after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
          (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made
              so far in the Auction.

      End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
      there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
      winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
      without a valid Bid having been made.

      The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
      largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The
      Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
      as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
      a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
      equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

76. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

82. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Simplify Probate

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
          entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.

Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.

Plainness is a Virtue

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1023 be amended to read:

      (a) Any Player who fails to perform, in a timely manner, an
          action required of em by the Rules is guilty of Tardiness, a
          Class D Crime.

      (b) The definition of "a timely manner" shall be at the sound
          discretion of the Judge assigned to judge a CFJ alleging
          this crime, but shall in no case include:
        (1) intentional failures to perform; nor
        (2) intentional and excessive delays in performance.

      (c) Generally, performance within one week's time will be timely
          unless the Rules suggest otherwise.  The performance of
          actions in an order other than that in which the duties to
          perform them were incurred may be used as evidence of
          untimely performance, but is not proof thereof.

      (d) This Rule in no way modifies any requirement imposed by
          other Rules to perform specific acts within a specific time
          or in a specific order.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

86. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Oh, what a tangled web....

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 478 be amended to read:

      (a) A Public Forum is any medium of communication so designated
          as such by the Registrar.

      (b) The Registrar may designate any medium as a Public Forum, or
          revoke such designation from a medium already so designated,
          Without Objection.  However, the message which is to
          effectuate the change intended must be sent via a medium
          which is a Public Forum both before and after the
          designation or revocation, in order to have legal effect.

      (c) The Registrar may designate any medium (other than one which
          is designated as a Public Forum) as a Discussion Forum,
          Without Objection, and may revoke such designation in the
          same manner.  The designation of a medium as a Public Forum
          automatically revokes any designation of that same medium as
          a Discussion Forum.

      (d) Every Active Player shall ensure that e is able to receive
          messages sent to every medium which the Registrar has
          designated as a Public Forum.  However, the temporary
          inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not
          deprive that medium of its status as a Public Forum.

      (e) Any message conveyed by one or more Public Fora is deemed to
          have been sent to the Public Forum.  In addition, any
          message sent, by any medium or combination of media, other
          than a medium designated as a Discussion Forum, to every
          Active Player so that each Active Player is reasonably
          certain to receive it, is deemed to have been sent to the
          Public Forum, but only if it bears an explicit indication
          that it is intended to be a Public Forum message.

      (f) Whenever the Rules require a Player to "announce", "post",
          or "distribute" some communication or notification, that
          Player shall do so by sending it to the Public Forum, unless
          the Rules specify otherwise in that instance.

      (g) When the Rules require that a message be sent directly to a
          Player, or make a legal effect contingent on sending a
|         message to a Player, the use of a Discussion Forum to send
          such a message shall not be effective unless the receiving
          Player explicitly or implicitly confirms having received
          that message.

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1768 be amended to read:

      (a) The published Report of an Officer, with respect to those
          matters reported therein which that Officer is required by
          law to report, shall be determinative evidence of the facts
          therein presented, in the absence of clear and convincing
          evidence contrary to those facts.

      (b) No challenge to the published Report of an Officer, with
          respect to those matters reported therein which that Officer
          is required by law to report, shall proceed unless:
        (1) it was initiated within 21 days of the publication of that
            report; or
        (2) credible evidence that the Officer acted in bad faith, or
            acted in good faith upon information presented to em in
            bad faith, is presented.

      (c) For the purpose of this Rule, the Speaker shall be
          considered an Officer.

Appeal Tweaks

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1570 be amended to read:

      (a) As soon as possible after an Application for Appeal of a
          Judgement or Motion has been executed, the Clerk of the
          Court shall:
        (1) assign, according to the procedures defined elsewhere,
            three Players to serve as the Board of Appeal for that
            Appeal; and
        (2) publish a Notice of Appeal identifying the Judgement or
            Motion being Appealed, and the identity of the three
            Players selected under subparagraph (a)(1) above.

      (b) The Clerk of the Courts shall develop and utilize a system
          of numbering or otherwise identifying Calls for Appeals such
          that Players may readily and unambiguously refer to any
          individual Appeal without undue difficulty or confusion.

      (c) If the Clerk of the Courts is in doubt as to whether an
          Application for Appeal has been successfully executed, e
          shall proceed as if it had been successfully executed,
          reserving the question of successful execution to the Board
          of Appeals.

      (d) If the Board of Appeals finds that the Application for
          Appeal which led to the appointment of that Board was not
          successfully executed, it may (at its discretion) dismiss
          the Appeal, without making any ruling on the merits of the
          Appeal.

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to execute a Payment
          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a
          Payment Order for zero units of any Currency.  Such Payment
          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

91. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Executorship

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a
          Certificate of Executorship was filed falsely shall Order
          the Notary to disregard that filing.

      (g) For the purpose of subdivision (e) of this Rule, the holder
          of any of the following positions shall be considered an
          Officer when performing a duty required by or a privilege
          permitted only by virtue of holding that position:
        (1) the Speaker;
        (2) the Recordkeepor of a Currency; or
        (3) the Trustee of an entity in Probate.

Cleanup of R.1445

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended to read:

      (a) When an Election is required and the procedure is not
          defined elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure
          shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults which
          may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity
            responsible for taking nominations, collecting and
            tallying the Votes, and announcing the result.
          (A) Unless otherwise specified, this Entity is the Player
              who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
          (B) If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the
              Vote Collector for the entire duration of the
              Referendum.
          (C) If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered
              before the Voting Period ends, the Election has no
              Winner.
        (2) Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
            eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the
            time a Player makes a Nomination.
        (3) Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by
            sending a message to the Vote Collector during the
            Nominating Period, indicating what Election e is
            Nominating for.
        (4) Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
            called a Candidate for that Election.
        (5) Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector,
            may be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period.
            A player may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a
            message to the Vote Collector, indicating that e wishes to
            retract eir Nomination.
        (6) Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
            time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
            Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for
            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to
          the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
          Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
          standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
          exceptions:
        (1) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is
            the same as the Vote Collector for the Election.
        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

          Proposal, and are deemed to have been executed as of the
          date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:

            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

            Resign from the Group at any time; and
        (3) its Agent has filed a Declaration of Group Status with the

Be it further resolved, that Rule 718 be repealed.

            Policy";
        (3) it specifies, by name, an Office to which it pertains; and
        (4) that Office is held by its author.

      (b) Once posted in accordance with subdivision (a) of this Rule,
          a Statement of Policy is binding upon the Player who issued
          it for as long as it remains in force.

      (c) An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
          Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.

          constrains.

      (d) Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of
          Policy, a Class 2 Crime.

          clearly identify the entity to which the Will is to belong,
          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an
          Application is to create a Will belonging to that entity. 
          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the
          Adminstrator of its former SLC, and its Membership shall be

          characteristics set forth above by events occuring after the
          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

Some Housecleaning

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      (a) The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days
          of when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir
          assignment to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ
          by dismissing or judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying
          any outstanding judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.

      (b) The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
          time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
          carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction
          thereof) that the case remains open beyond the permitted
          time.  This penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the
          Courts.

      (c) The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
          cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor
          does it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or
          grant or denial of any related judicial motion which that
          Judge might submit after the limit has expired.

      (d) This Rule defers to any other Rule which prescribes a
          different time limit in which a CFJ must be closed, and to
          any other Rule which establishes procedures by which the
          time limit specified in this Rule may be extended or
          shortened.

            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;

            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.
        (3) The Amendment Number of a Rule is incremented by one
            whenever a Rule Change affecting that Rule takes place.

      (b) A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official
          copies of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and
          separated by a forward slash.  Responsibility is given to
          the Rulekeepor to accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

          full the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in
          conjunction with other Rules.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

106. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Reformat Rule 1434

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1434 be amended to read:

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      (a) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
          for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the
          result. This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise
          specified.

      (b) Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
          Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
          sends eir Vote.

      (c) Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the
          Vote Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what
          Referendum e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      (d) Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
          are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      (e) Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting
          Entity may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      (f) Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot
          be changed.

      (g) Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
          first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
          begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
          Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      (h) Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.
          All Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the
          Voting Period have no effect.

      (i) Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
          while the Voting is underway.

      (j) This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
          posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of
          those Players who have already Voted.

      (k) Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
          Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as
          the name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      (l) Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes
          on a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be
          greater than Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it
          is not, the Referendum fails.

      (m) Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption
          Index for a Referendum is 1.

      (n) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
          Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
          fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      (o) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of a
          Referendum is not announced within one Week following the
          end of the Voting Period, it automatically fails.

      (p) Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
          in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
          into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
          Public Forum.

          already been vacated.

      (d) Nothing in any Order shall act to prevent or hinder judicial
          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has

Changing the Bar Height

Create a rule, with title "The Priority Bar", and text:

      (a) The Priority Bar is the minimum Priority needed for a 
          Proposal to be distributed. It is an integer multiple of 
          the MUQ of P-Notes, lying between zero and two inclusive.

      (b) Upon the adoption of the proposal which created this rule,
          its value shall be set to one.


      (c) The Promotor may change the value of the Priority Bar by
          announcing its new value in the Public Forum, provided that
          the new value is within the range allowed by subdivision (a)
          of this Rule.

      (d) Whenever a new value is announced according to subdivision
          (c) of this Rule, the new value takes effect at the
          beginning of the next Nomic Week, unless the announcement is
          made within three days of the end of the current Nomic Week,

      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided 
      that this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

Amend Rule 1770 by replacing the text:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

with:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than or equal to the Priority Bar is less than 
      or equal to the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of all 
      such Proposals.

      Otherwise, the batch shall consist of those Proposals in the 
      Queue with the highest Priority such that the number of 
      Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

Amend Rule 1701 by replacing the text:

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.

with

      The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1.

Create a rule with title "The Promotor's Commission" and text:

      Each week, after distributing a batch of proposals, the 
      Promotor may order the Bank to pay out a number of P-Notes
      equal to five percent of the total Priority of the proposals
      in the batch.

[Comments:

v1.0 - Based on Gen Chaos' "Make the Proposal Queue More Competitive"
       proposal. Changes the minimum Priority needed to get a Proposal
       distributed. Now allows fractional Priorities.

       Benefits:

       1) Promotes competition for Queue positions by increasing the
       range of profitable Priority values.

       2) Allows sharing of support for Proposals

       3) Gives the Promotor a handle on the P-Note economy,

       4) Allows an anti-capitalist Promotor to make proposing free,
          if e so desires. 

v1.1 - Changed references to "real numbers" to "integer multiples of
       the MUQ of P-Notes". It's a bit clumsy, but it's probably 
       safer.

v1.2 - Gave the Promotor a cut of the action, much like the Assessor's.
       As is the case with the Assessor, manipulating the Batch Size
       and the Priority Bar will affect the commission - but should
       e strive to distribute many proposals cheaply, or a few at a
       very high price?

116. Proposal by Peekee, AI=1
Power to the Senate

Let it there fore be resolved that rule 1717 be amended to read:

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  Some Players are Senators.  The Senate is 
the set of all Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

Only players may be senators.  If a Senator is removed from the Senate, 
e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.  If it is impossible to tell 
which player has not been a Senator for the longest period of time, then 
all players, who arguable share the longest period of time not being a 
Senator, become Senators.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate, by stating 
so in a public forum.



Create a new rule titled "Senator Suggestions" with the following title:

A Senate Suggestion is a piece of text sent to a public forum by a 
Senator.  It must state clearly that it is a Senate Suggestion and 
contain a valid Suggestion, or it fails to be a Senate Suggestion.

Only Senators may make Senate Suggestions.  Senate Suggestions may be 
made only as defined by the rules.  A Senate must contain all the 
information needed, as defined by the rules, or it fails to be a Senate 
Suggestion.

Any Senator may object to a Senate Suggestion, by making a Senator 
Objection.  Senate Objections must be made in a public forum, making 
clear the suggestion they object to, and that in fact the text is a 
Senator Objection.



Create a new rule titled "Senate Powers" with the following text:

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a registered player becomes 
a Senator.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
player in the Suggestion.  The player becomes a Senator one week after 
the suggestion, unless there is a Senator Objection to the suggestion 
within the week.

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a Senator is removed from 
the Senate.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
Senator in the Suggestion.  The Senator is removed from the Senate one 
week after the suggestion, unless there are at least 2 Senator 
Objections to the suggestion within the week.



Create a rule titled "Senate Proposals" with the following text:

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposals Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time 
it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes on that Proposal are cancelled, 
these votes remain canceled even if the Proposal reverts from being a 
Senate Proposal.

		       PROPOSALS 3834 THRU 3836

There are three proposals distributed as of this report, numbered from
3834 to 3836.  The Voting Periods of these Proposals commence as of
this message and end seven days later unless otherwise noted.  Voting
on these Proposals will cost 0.4 VTs.

======================================================================

Proposal 3834 (Blob) AI = 1
Modes of Voting

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing
      mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals, with Support. 

       (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections, with Support. 

       (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

       (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.

 v1.1 - Modified it to use the new "With Support" rule. Removed the
        clause describing timing, as that is covered by "With Support"
        (albeit in a different way).

        I am in the process of bringing the numbering in line with
        Gen Chaos' standard, but I've lost the message in which he
        described it. 

        Removed the final clause as it didn't seem to have any real
        purpose.

Proposal 3835 (Michael) AI = 1


That Rule 1854 ("The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary") be
amended to read:

The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary by first announcing
that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that e announces a
value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive.  The change to the Basic
Officer Salary then occurs at the beginning of the next week if the
announcement was made on a Thursday or earlier in the week.  If the
announcement is made later in the week, then the change occurs at the
start of the second week after the announcement. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3836 (General Chaos) AI = 1
Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
            performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.
