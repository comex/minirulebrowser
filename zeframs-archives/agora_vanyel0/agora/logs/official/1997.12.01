  Judged FALSE, 30 Nov 1997 21:16:54 +1100


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

As Zefram has pointed out, "A player is anyone who is registered as a player"
may (especially with game custom backing it) be interpreted as making "player"
and "person who is registered as a player" synonymous.

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

Some preliminary remarks are in order. Firstly, on the logical form
of the Statement: Immediately after event A occurred, event B occurred.
I take this as implying that event A actually did occur. Therefore,
among the matters to be considered is the question of whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. If he did not, then the Statement would
be FALSE.

Secondly, on the use of the phrase 'immediately after'. There is some
temptation to think that if the Rules support the conclusion that
Morendil's becoming Speaker brought in its train his registration,
that these events happened, strictly speaking, at the same time, and
not one after the other. It might be argued that in that case, the
Statement is trivially FALSE. However, given our history of
interpreting some events as happening at the same time but in a
particular order, I'm inclined to allow the Caller some latitude in
this respect. If the Rules support the conlusion that Morendil did
become Speaker, and that he was registered as a result, in my view a
Judgement that the Statement is TRUE is indicated.

The first question to be considered, therefore, is whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. A consensus seems have developed that he
did, but I think it is worth rehearsing, and putting on the Judicial
record, the arguments to that effect. These are, briefly, as follows:
R1445 states that "The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
whom the most votes were cast." Morendil was a Candidate for the
Office of Speaker-Elect, and nothing in the Rules implies that he
ceased to be one when he was deregistered during the Voting Period.
He did receive the most votes in the Election, beating General Chaos
5-4, and was therefore the Winner of the Election. R790 states that
"The winner of [an] Election...hold[s] [the] Office until e resigns
or is retired or removed from that Office" and this Rule takes
precedence over R1006 which states that an Office must be held by a
Player.  Morendil therefore became the first non-Player ever to hold
Office, holding the Office of Speaker-Elect as of Oct. 17. A Revolt
occurred on Nov. 3, and in accordance with R1664, Morendil became
Speaker. Crucially, this was not blocked by R103, which states only
that "each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker; no Player
may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker." Since Morendil was not
a Player when he became Speaker, these provisions did not apply to
him and could not have been violated. This is sufficient to establish
that Morendil did indeed become Speaker.

We turn now to the second question, that of Morendil's registration.
Although Morendil was not a Player when he became Speaker, his
becoming Speaker caused him to become a Player, or at least to be
deemed to be a Player for all legal purposes, which amounts to the
same thing. This is because R103 states that "The term "Player" in
the Rules shall specifically include...the Speaker."

Now, the first paragraph of R869 states that:

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

My initial inclination was to take R103 as implying, in conjunction
with R869, that being the Speaker is a sufficient condition for being
registered as a Player. On further consideration, however, I am now
inclined to reject this view. Being Registered is defined by R869
and not by R103. There is no conflict between the two Rules on the
question of what it is to be Registered. The conflict arises only
over the question of what it is to be a Player. In effect, the first
paragraph of R869 states that a Player is any person who has sent a
message to PF requesting Registration. This brings R869 into conflict
with R103, which makes Morendil a Player despite his not having sent
such a message to the PF since the time of his last deregistration,
on Oct 14. This conflict R103 wins. Thus it is my judgement that we
should properly regard Morendil as having become a Player without
being, or becoming, Registered.

I therefore rule that the Statement is FALSE.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
