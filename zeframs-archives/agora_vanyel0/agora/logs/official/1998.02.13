At Thu, 12 Feb 1998 16:25:12 -0800 Time Agent rebelled, thereby
causing a Revolt. 

I attach my claim as to the state of the game as it stands at that

job at this stage.

First stage: 

Steve becomes Speaker.  This requires Morendil to initiate a Speaker
Transition (see rule 402).  

R1664 says: "If a revolt occurs, then: 
               - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker"

R402 says: "Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become
            Speaker..." 

R402 does allow for immediate speaker transitions, but R1664 doesn't
call for such (compare with R1581 which does).

OK, next stage: 
  all players that hold one or more offices are retired from all
  offices. 

This means that the Office list (the Blue pages) now looks like: 

Office                Holder                    Term of Service
------                ------             -----------------------------

Wizard                General Chaos     temporary since 19980213002512

The only interesting case is CotC.  elJefe's delegation must now fail
because he does not hold the office normally when Blob accepts it.
The people holding the Offices as delegates are already holding them
temporarily, so there status doesn't change. 

(We have

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation

and 

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

       ...

      (iv)  the Delegating Player still holds the Office in the
            normal fashion at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

)

Final stage:
  All rebellious players become Abiding again. 


Michael.
