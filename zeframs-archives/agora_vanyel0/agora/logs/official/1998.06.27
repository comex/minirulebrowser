Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3761 (Steve) AI = 1
P-Note supply

[Comment: since Rulekeepor Chuck informs us that P3744 did not succeed
in amending R833, and since that amendment in my opinion was a desirable
one, I'm proposing it again.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 (Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed)
be amended by replacing in the text which currently reads:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for adopted Proposals distributed at the same time.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Proposal Notes to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.
