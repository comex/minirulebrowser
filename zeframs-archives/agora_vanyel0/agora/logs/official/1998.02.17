I have submitted, on behalf of Agora, the following proposal which has
now been distributed by the IN moderator:

INP 363

Create a new rule with the text:

 The moderator should be subscribed to the Internomic mailing
 list. Whenever the rules require someone to communicate with the 
 moderator, sending the communication to the Internomic mailing
 list is sufficient to fulfill this requirement.


[This is to avoid losing and having to resubmit proposals, as in the
case of INP360-2].

Voting in our Agora referendum on this lasts until Tue, 24 Feb 1998
18:05:12 +0200 (EET).
