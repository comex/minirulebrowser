Here is the final judgement of CFJ 1087. 

I don't much like the wording of R1447/11: it is not clear to me that
it gives me the right to order POs to pay the Justices their
salaries.  Would anyone care to convince me that it does?

    Decisions published, as of this message

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The last sentence of rule 1766 states that 'This provision shall not
increase the maximum number of votes that are permitted to be cast by
that Player.' The previous sentence states '... then that Player may
cast two additional votes on that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise
entitled to cast.' I argue that the first sentence would, in fact,
raise the maximum number of votes above what it would otherwise be
(two), and thus the second sentence renders that null.

Rule 206 says that 'Each Voting Entity has two votes on a proposal,
unless another Rule says otherwise.' This clearly establishes a
maximum number of legal votes. The second sentence of that paragraph
says 'However, no such Entity shall have more than five votes on any
Proposal, regardless of what any other Rule may say to the contrary.'
This establishes a second maximum on the number of votes which may
legally cast, such that the maximum equates to 'two, plus any granted
by other rules, or five, whichever is lower'.

======================================================================
Evidence supplied by Caller:

Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to be
      a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal
      unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities designated
      by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting Entities. Players
      and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.


======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

I'm still not satisfied with my own reasoning on this, nor with
the arguments that have been offered, pro or con. I therefore return
a decision of FALSE, on the grounds that Rule 1660 does succeed in
granting additional Votes, despite being afflicted with essentially
the same wording as 1766; however, I also call for the Appeal of my
own Judgement, thereby kicking it up to the higher Court. I will
present a fuller version of my analysis of 206, 1766 and 1660 in that
capacity, hopefully made more cogent by conferring with my fellow
Justices.

======================================================================
Decision of the Clerk of the Courts:  SUSTAIN

This CFJ turns on the final sentence of Rule 1766:
                                                         This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

A natural interpretation is that "maximum number of votes that are
permitted" is used to distinguish this usage from the ordinary phrase
"number of votes that are permitted".  This respects the fact that
under the current Rules, the "number of votes" permitted may vary
according to circumstances, but never beyond an absolute "maximum
number of votes" set by Rule 206, namely five votes.

The caller would have the "maximum number of votes" refer to the
number of votes permitted unless otherwise modified by the Rule,
namely two votes, and concludes that the Rule awards no extra votes.

I find that the Rule is at worst ambiguous on this detail. The
Caller's interpretation may be a possible one, but he presents no
argument that it is the _only_ possible one.  Indeed, the existence of
the "natural" interpretation above vitiates any such argument.  But
for the sake of argument let us say that there are two possible
interpretations.  Then we are permitted to consider other factors like
Game Custom and common sense.

The caller's preferred meaning does violence to common sense.  He
would see Rule 1766 as saying "This Rule gives the Officer two votes
beyond his normal limit.  This Rule does not give the Officer any
votes beyond his normal limit."  This is not a sensible
interpretation, and the common interpretation recently of the voters
(their "common sense", in fact) was that the Rule did indeed grant the
Officers extra voting power.

Game Custom is also clear: this Rule has been applied before, in
Proposal 3686.  Further, the Speaker's Vote (Rule 1660), with similar
language, has operated unchallenged since October 1996.

Finally, past judgements have affirmed the ancient principle that if
there are two readings of a Rule, one which is meaningful and one
which deprives the Rule of meaning, the meaningful one is to be
preferred.  In this case, the caller's interpretation deprives the
Rule of meaning, and the one where "maximum" refers to "five votes" is
the preferred reading.

I stress that this is not the same as the Kudo Transfer CFJ (long
ago), where common sense and long Game Custom bowed to the text of the
Rule.  The text of a Rule is supreme when it is consistent and clear,
but when it is not then Game Custom etc. may be used to clarify its
meaning. (Rule 217)

One nagging question: if the natural reading is correct, why does that
last sentence appear at all?  The argument goes that it could just as
well be left out, since the Rule would lose any conflict with Rule
206.

I see it as making sense in a historical context. In the original
Ruleset, a Rule conflicting with an Immutable Rule would be entirely
invalid (this is also true in other Nomics like FRC).  Thus some of us
have the generally good habit of adding conditions to a Rule which
keep it from any appearance of conflict with high-precedence Rules.
The last sentence of Rule 1766 appears as just such an attempt.

I sustain Morendil's Judgement.

======================================================================
Decision of the Speaker:  SUSTAIN

I am satisfied to join this Judgement, since it encapsulates my own
reasoning about the case.

> Reasons and arguments:

> This CFJ turns on the final sentence of Rule 1766:

>      This shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
>      permitted to be cast by that Player.

> A natural interpretation is that "maximum number of votes that are
> permitted" is used to distinguish this usage from the ordinary

> that under the current Rules, the "number of votes" permitted may
> vary according to circumstances, but never beyond an absolute
> "maximum number of votes" set by Rule 206, namely five votes.

This makes it sound as though R206 explicitly refers to a maximum
number of votes, which it does not.  One has to do a little
interpretative work to conclude that the maximum referred to by R1766
and by R1660 is this five-vote limit.  Nevertheless, I agree that this
is what it refers to.


======================================================================
Decision of Justice Jester:

I hereby announce that I sustain Morendil's judgement in CFJ 1087.

The other appeal judges will probably give a detailed explanation of
the decision so I won't reiterate their discussion. Suffice to say
that I concur with them.

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reaons and arguments:

Rule 1483/3 (Definition of Proposals) reads, in part,

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

Based on this definition and the publically known facts, it is clear
that the proposal ("collection of text, delivered to the promotor with
the clear indication etc..") referred to in the statement for this
judgement was created, and exists.

This proposal was then given a number and placed in the proposal queue
(even if its text was not rendered correctly in the inofficial part of
the document in which the Promotor published the proposal queue at the
time). For the number note that at the time in question R109 was still
in the old form 109/2, which assigned proposal numbers at the time of
submission, not distribution. For the text note that R1036 states that
"The actual text of the Proposals in the Queue need not be published."
Therefore, the proposal queue did contain the proposal.

However, while the text of a proposal or its scrambled rendition in
the publication of the Proposal Queue has no legal significance for
the state of the proposal queue, R1770 (Distributing Proposals)
requires that "Proposals" be distributed, i.e. the body of text that
consitutes the proposal.

In the case of P3710, this didn't happen, and the difference between
the distributed body of text and the true proposal 3710 is not
insignificant. The only rules that deny minor differences between
texts any significance are Rule 754/3 (Spelling and Grammar Errors)
and Rule 1339/6 (Precision in Rule Changes) which allow "Differences
in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a word or
phrase by a synonym or abbreviation [...] as long as there is no
ambiguity in meaning" resp. "Variations in whitespace or
capitalization in the quotation of text in an existing Rule to be
removed or replaced". However, the differing parts of P3710 and the
distributed text were "Proposal <proposal number> at time" and
"Proposal <proposal numberat time", and do not contain a difference
covered by the quoted rules.

Therefore the text distributed by the Promotor was not the Proposal
submitted by Swann and entitled "The Great Officer's Veto Scam
Proposal", and the statement for this judgement is true.

Although it isn't strictly relevant to this statement for judgement, I
would like to add that the above arguments imply that the text
distributed wasn't proposal 3710, either. According to this
interpretation, P3710 is still in the proposal queue; the Promotor
broke the rules governing the distribution of proposals because e did
not yet distribute it, and, in addition, published wrong proposal
queue listings. Additionally, one might argue that the votes that
players and other voting entities tried to cast on P3710 were cast
before the voting period on this proposal began and were thus illegal
according to Rule 683/5 (Legal Votes). They should also not have led
to POs according to 1442. The attempt to make the proposal a Senate
Proposal was ineffective for the same reason.

======================================================================


(Caller's) Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo not
present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims that,
therefore, Swann's Proposal was not distributed.

With this notice, Steve ceases to be Speaker and is replaced in that
post by Blob, who was Speaker-Elect at the start of the new quarter.
This transition has occurred because of R1581, which calls for a
Speaker Transition upon the commencement of each new quarter. 

I will shortly begin an Election for the post of Speaker-Elect, which
is now held temporarily.  Speaker Blob must now act as Arbiter of
Succession for the post while it is held temporarily. 

Registrar Michael.

======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3718 (Steve) AI = 1
Indelible Proposal voting

[Comment: indelible voting has a number of advantages: it's legislatively
simpler (no need to worry about retracted or changed votes), it
encourages VT spending since Players can't retract votes in excess
of those needed to achieve the result they desire, and it provides a
negotiation-friendly environment, since Players can publically keep
promises and/or signal that they are not available to be negotiated
with by voting.]

Be it therefore resolved that R683 have its Title changed to
"Voting on Proposals" and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. Once cast, a
      vote cannot be changed or cancelled by the Voting Entity which
      cast it, although it may be cancelled as other Rules require.

      A vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a vote upon a Proposal.

      A vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any entity to cast votes upon
      Proposals.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1442 have its Title changed to
"The Cost of Voting" and that it be amended to read:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

[Comment: together these amendments also eliminate some overlap between
the current versions of these Rules. They do take in to account the
effect of Omnibus Reform, assuming that passes.

======================================================================
Proposal 3719 (Swann) AI = 1
A minor Score Fix

Rule 1783 is amended by replacing the text;
", and specifying the magnitude of that change."

with the text;
", the magnitude of the change, and whether that change is
 a gain or a loss."

{Comment: Fixes the bug which allows a Score change to be ordered
          by saying a Player's Score changes by X points, w/o saying
          if X is positive or negative.}
