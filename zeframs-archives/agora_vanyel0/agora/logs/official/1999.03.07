Crito, G. Chaos, please note that I did not execute Lee's Probate

  0.7 VTs from Lee to Bank, satisfying Payment Order VT662
  2.8 VTs from Lee to Macross
  2 P-Notes from Lee to Macross (#147)
  1 Indulgence from Lee to Macross

However, I do execute Lee's Probate plan later in this message.

I apologize for not catching this sooner.

I find to my surprise that none of the Caller, G. Chaos, the original
Judge, Morendil, or Speaker Murphy (who has already delivered his
Appellate Judgement to overturn) have addressed in their arguments what
I consider to be the central issue of this CFJ, that is, the scope of
discretionary powers of the Assessor in counting ambiguously cast votes.

In Morendil's case this is perhaps more understandable, since it his
view that the ambiguity of Vlad's voting message is legally irrelevant
to the case. It was his contention that:

      The Rules do not mandate that a message purporting to contain a
      Vote should unambiguously express the voting Player's intent; all
      that they require is that such a message clearly identify an
      existing Proposal, the Voting Period of which is underway, which
      was the case.

However, I do not see on what Morendil bases this view. The only Rule
which speaks to the legality of casting votes on a Proposal (in the
sense which is of interest here) is R683, which says only that:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to cast those votes on that Proposal. 

But the Rules are silent on the issue of the clarity with which "that
Proposal" must be identified in a voting message. In my view, General
Chaos and Speaker Murphy were therefore mistaken when they asserted 
that Assessor Blob erred in counting Vlad's votes because Vlad's voting
message did not clearly identify which Proposal he was voting on. I
accept, as they do, that Vlad's voting message was ambiguous. But there
is no requirement for clear identification in R683.

In the absence of such a requirement, we are led to an examination of
the discretionary powers of the Assessor in such a situation. I can find
nothing in the Rules which requires the Assessor to reject ambiguously
cast votes, nor anything which prohibits the Assessor from exercising
his discretion to resolve the ambiguity as e thinks is proper, although
naturally the Assessor would want to think about how his action might be
viewed in the light of R1665 (Abuse of Responsibility). I view Assessor
Blob's decision to count Vlad's votes as he did as the exercise of such
a discretionary power, and it seems to me that he was within his rights.
In saying that, I am not saying anything one way or the other about
whether Blob was guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, since that is a
matter I have not been asked to adjudicate upon. I am only saying Blob
was legally entitled to act as he did.

However, since this line of reasoning has not been considered so far, I
thnk it would be wise to place the CFJ before a new Judge who can
consider its worth.

I therefore OVERTURN Morendil's Judgement, and call for the CFJ to be
re-assigned.

      that CFJ.

      Any Player Barred from Judging a CFJ is ineligible to Judge that CFJ.

Amend Rule 1562 (Excess CFJs) by replacing this text:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of   
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

with this text:

Amend Rule 1567 (Making Oneself Ineligible to Judge a CFJ) to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific  
      CFJ or type of CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the
      Courts, specifying the CFJ or type of CFJ for which e wishes to
      be made ineligible.  Such a notice remains in effect until the
      Player informs the Clerk of the Courts that it is no longer in
      effect.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner, e has already been selected as the
      Judge of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that
      Player a fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge
      of that CFJ.
