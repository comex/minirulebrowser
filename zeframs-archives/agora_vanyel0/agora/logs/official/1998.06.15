  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Obviously there is a huge loophole in the Order rules, which allows
any player to issue these kinds of orders.  I see Swann's points and
am in some sympathy with them, but the specific question of the CFJ
concerns the series of orders in "Here we go...".  Some of these order
individual players to refrain from granting or making certain judicial
motions or making orders or appealing other orders, and others order
individual players to refrain from appealing the ones just mentioned.

These are not Orders to Compel directed to a Judge (Rule 1830), but
are merely restraining in character.  The Caller argues that none of
the orders individually hinder their own appeal, even though they do
collectively seek to prevent their own appeal.

A question: if order X seeks to prevent the appeal of order Y, and
order Y seeks to prevent the appeal of order X, then in that context,
is Y acting to hinder its own appeal? I would have to say yes,
indirectly.

If order X seeks to prevent the appeal of all other orders, and a
later order Y seeks to prevent the appeal of order X, then in that
context, is Y acting to hinder its own appeal?  Again I would say yes,
indirectly.  And Rule 1796 contains the phrase "in any way", which is
strong enough to contain direct and indirect actions.

I therefore rule that at least the even numbered Orders (of the form
"Order 2n+2: player #n is ordered to refrain from appealing Order
2n+1") are barred by Rule 1796.  This is enough to determine a
judgement of FALSE.

I do not go so far as to infer the invalidating of the odd-numbered
Orders, though I admit there is a talking point there as well. A
definitive judgement on that question would be thorny and unnecessary
to the present CFJ, and thus I leave it to another Judge.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

For the basic valitity of a private transfer order I refer the Judge
to the Reasons and Arguments of the first Coup d'etat CFJ. (qv)

For the validity of the current statement, there are only two rules
that would impose additional restrictions on these Orders.  These are
Rules 1796 and 1830.

The apparently strong Rule 1830;

>       No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
>       require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
>       virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is
>       invalid.  Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform
>       a duty of a judicial nature shall be dismissed.

There are a number of flaws here.  One, it is arguable that one can
compel Judical actions as long as the Player comelled is not a Judge
at the time, which none of the Players in the Orders in question were.
Two, the rule makes no refernce to Orders that phrohibit action
(ie. An order not to Judge FALSE) which is the form in which the
Orders in question were cast.  Three, the most devistating flaw, this
rule refers *only* to Orders to Compel-- a specific type of Order
defined in Rule 1509;

>       Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
>       duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
>       execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty
>       as soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
>       Compel.
>

It is unquestionably true that the Orders in question were *not*
Orders to Compel as defined in the rules, and therefore 1830 does not
apply at all.

The other rule that applies is Rule 1796;

>       Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
>       appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
>       effect is void and without force.

This is much simpler.  None of the Orders in question hinder their
*own* appeal, they only hinder the appeal of other Orders, which is
not forbidden.

Given these facts, I believe that the Judge has no question but to
rule these Orders valid.
======================================================================
Evidence:


Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule 1509/3 (Power=1)
Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a
      duty required of em by the Rules, the Judge so finding shall
      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to
      Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

      If the duty in question arises for a reason not related to the
      Player in question holding a specific Office or official
      position, and that Player fails to perform the duty as ordered,
      the Judge shall amend the Order to require the Speaker to
      perform that duty instead.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1830/0 (Power=1)
No Compulsion of Judges

      No valid Order to Compel may be directed to a Judge, or may
      require the performance of any duty required of Player by the
      virtue of that Player being a Judge.  Any such Order is invalid.
      Any CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a duty of a
      judicial nature shall be dismissed.

  Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule
  1513 and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that

  Rules and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an
  Order conflicts with a Rule.

  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Rule 1586 defines:

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

Rule 1793 defines:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

It is my view that a command as above clearly has discernible
existence without the rules - it would be quite possible to make such
even if Rule 1793 did not exist.  Thus the part of the statement

'An Order, as defined in Rule 1793, and of whatever type, is "a Nomic
Entity created in accordance with the Rules" in the sense of Rule 1513
and as such is subject to the limitations set forth in that Rule,'

is false.

It is equally clear that the validity and coercive power (through
penalties) of an Order is derived from the Rules.  So the part of the
statement

'and in particular that Orders derive coercive power from some Rules'

is true.

While the above suffices to determine the Judgement, there are more
subtle issues here, which I wish to detail.  Rule 1513 says:

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.

It is my view that the Rules do _not_ grant such power to Orders.
Compare the situation for Orders with that of Subordinate Legal Codes:

>From Rule 1591:

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.

>From Rule 1594:

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.


For SLCs, there is a clear granting of powers and requirements.  For
Orders, however, there are only defined Crimes for non-compliance.

In my view, a Crime is not automatically a Rule violation, and thus
the Rules do not in fact require Orders to be followed in the same way
as an SLC.

Thus, the part of the statement

'and that the Rules take precedence over Orders whenever an Order
conflicts with a Rule.'

is true, in the sense that Players, in order to comply with the Rules,
may have to commit a Crime by disobeying an order; however not in the
sense that the entire Order and its penalty is escaped because of the
conflict.

I know that several Players think that Crimes should be automatic Rule
Violations, but I think that matter is better settled by legislation.

However, regardless of this issue in particular, at least one part of
the statement is false.

I therefore judge FALSE.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I can easily predict that we'll have a hard time dealing with
Swann's recent posts unless we hare a clear notion of how to deal
with Orders as a whole. I propose the above principle, with Orders
being NREs deriving coercive power from, specifically, Rules 1810 and
1811 (although that may be debated, which is why I didn't make the
CFJ dependent on that).

The rationale for that principle is that insofar as the Rules can be
said to "compel" or "prohibit" certain actions which are non-
retractable Moves, the instrument of such coercion is the threat of
being cited for a Crime or Infraction. Thus a Rule which makes a
Crime or Infraction of some action or inaction which is defined in
some body of text other than the Rules themselves can be said to
grant coercive power to that body of text, which brings it under the
purview of Rule 1513.

Thus, an Order prohibiting a Player from Calling for Judgement,
which is what the Orders in "Here we go..." effectively do, is in
conflict with Rule 911, and as such shall be deemed invalid; most
of Swann's other Orders are dealt with similarly, or at the least
innocuuous given that the higher-precedence judicial framework
is preserved by the NRE principle. Conversely, the NRE principle
does not rob other Orders of their effectiveness, and will not
require huge patching up of the Orders Rules to close supposed
loopholes therein.

        I hereby Order and command Player Antimatter to refrain from;
        issuing any Order that is of a type not explicitly defined in
        the Rules. E shall also refrain from issuing any
        Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private Order that is

        shall e issue any such Order except in such curcumstances
        where Rules explicitly permit em to issue such an Order.

1.3. Final amendment (at least as far as the present CFJ is concerned):

>Message-ID: <35659CB6.5BA4C2DF@gwis.com>

>From: Steven Swiniarski <saswann@gwis.com>
>Subject: OFF: The Coup Lives!  The Dictator finds a Loophole!

        I hereby Order Player Macross, to refrain from granting any
        and all Motions to stay, vacate or amend Orders issued by
        Player Swann.  Nor shall e grant any Motions to punish Swann
        for such Orders.  Nor shall e issue such Motions.  Nor shall e
        Order the stay, vacation or amendment of any Orders made by
        Player Swann. E must refrain from issuing any Administrative,
        Judicial, Appellate or Private Order that is of a type that is
        not explicitly defined in the Rules.  Nor shall e issue any
        such Order except in such curcumstances where Rules explicitly
        permit em to issue such an Order. If e has made an Order that
        does not conform to these criteria, e must vacate it within 72
        hours.


2. Were these amendments effective?
===================================


I don't see a problem with the first amendment.


2.1. Changing an order's target

Macross argued in a mail to a-d that the second amendment was
ineffective because it didn't only change the text of the order, but
also the player the order was directed at.

While I agree that the possibility to change, by amendment, the entity
an order is directed at is an unpleasant and possibly counterintuitive
one, this aesthetic consideration says nothing about the legality of
such changes (the possibility to vacate TOs after they have been
satisfied is ugly, too, but still it's there).

The rules don't explicitly define or limit the scope of order
amendments. While the entity issuing an order is determined by fact,
not by the choice of the entity issuing the order, the entity the
order is directed at is determined by the choice of the entity issuing
the order. Therefore I'm not convinced that the last amendment of the
order was ineffective because it tried to change the target of the
order.


2.2. Did the amended order fit the definition of an order?

Orders are defined in 1793 as

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It may be argued that the underlined text should be parsed
interpreting the "or" as an "exclusive or". I am not sure this is true
- the sentence also makes sense if we read it as a template for the
form of orders. E.g., an order of the form "I order player XY to
transfer 5 VTs to me, or to refrain from actions A, B and C" seems to
me to fit the definition in 1793.

However, the final version of the order had the form "I order Macross
to refrain from actions A, B, etc, _and_ to perform action X" where X
is "vacate any orders already made and against the provisions in this
order within 72 hours." So it did not fit the definition of 1793. As
an amended order has
                                                  effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      amendment becomes effective.
(1793) and the amended want-to-be-order was not an order, after
all, I think as an end result the original order _was_ amended, but
this amendment resulted in it becoming a non-order, with no legal
effects.

Note that the point is not whether the amended want-to-be-order was a
_valid_ or _legal_ order, but whether it was an order in the sense of
1793 at all.

Therefore the statement of this CFJ is true.

I believe that this order is invalid.  Rule 1793/0 reads in part:

      An Order is a command, executed by a Player and directed to some
      entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action, or
      to refrain from performing one or more actions.

You have here amended an order to require me to take an action and
to refrain from taking actions.  However an order may only do one or
the other, not both.  Thus I believe this order is by definition not
an Order at all.


I issue the order below, only if it is legal for me to do:

I hereby Order and command Player Swann to refrain from using words
       that are not spelled the same backwards as forwards when
       issuing any Administrative, Judicial, Appellate or Private
       Orders unless the issuing of those Orders is explicitly
       required of 'em by the Rules or by an Order issued by Player
       Macross.


This should effectively hold off the dictator.

-Macross

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This and the recent ruling on CFJ 1049 lead to the conclusion that the
Order was indeed issued.

In the Notary's Report of May 31, I incorrectly stated that Sherlock's
Probate had been completed.  I now correctly (I hope) state that Time
Agent's Probate is complete.

Crito, I haven't seen you submit a plan for Sherlock.  I assume that
you have "received" VT/P-Note/Indulgence data from yourself.  Have you
received Iris data from Harlequin?  If so, then you've probably
violated ASAP; if not, then Harlequin certainly has.
