==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

When P3809 took effect, it set the Voting Period to seven days.
Proposals 3810-3812 were distributed on Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29
(GMT).

Now there are, as far as I can see, three possible hypotheses as to when
the Voting Period on these proposals ends:

     i) Seven days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

    ii) Ten days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Thursday, December 10.

   iii) At the time P3809 took effect,
        at 07:55:39 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

Now I don't have any particular opinion as to which of these is true,
but I note that it doesn't make much practical difference whether it is
(i) or (iii), as no votes were cast during this period. The times
mentioned in the Statement are the times of the last recorded
vote before (i) and the first recorded vote after (iii).

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I rule true.

I have read the arguments. i think votes that were legal when cast
counted.  I don't buy that the VP was changed for all past proposals
were changed.

==========================================================================
Justice Crito's Arguments:

I sustain the TRUE verdict for CFJ 1110.

The truth or falsity of this CFJ statement depends on what it means for
a Voting Period to have ended.  The simplest and most natural answer to
this is to say that a VP has ended as long as the date designated by the
Rules to be the end of that VP is in the past.  At the time this CFJ was
called, there were only two dates that the Rules ever designated as the
end of the VPs for these proposals.  Both of these dates were in the
past relative to the time of this CFJ, and by this definition a
judgement of TRUE was supported.

However, much ink has been spilled on the discussion list concerning the
possibility that the "now" pointer of time must have passed through the
designated date for the VP to actually have ended.  This viewpoint
relies on the notion that the end of a VP is an event such as the
striking of a gavel (marking the end of the VP).  However, IMO, the text
of the Rule 693 does not support this viewpoint.  It does not even
mention the end of the VP specifically, it merely specifies the VPs
duration.  Duration is an attribute that the Rules are free to change at
any time.  (IMO, R101 prevents a change of attribute from having any
effect on events in the past, but this is an issue that is irrelevant to
the truth or falsity of this particular CFJ statement).  Therefore, I
believe this outcome is not supported and the judgement of TRUE should
withstand.

It might be useful to point out that one consequence of this is the fact
that the time period during which votes may legally be cast on a
particular proposal need not correspond to any time period designated as
a Voting Period of that proposal.  But this should not be so surprising
when one realizes that VPs are not defined in terms of when votes may
legally be cast, but that legal votes are defined in terms of VPs.

==========================================================================
Justice Morendil's Arguments:

As I see it, Blob's enumeration of the admissible hypotheses is
incomplete, and the very existence of CFJ 1111 attests to that. ;) For
completeness, they are as follows, and in no particular order, with D
(Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29) being the time of distribution;

a- the VP ended at D + 10 days, due to R693/3
b- the VP ended at D + 7 days, due to R693/4
c- the VP ended at the time P3809 took effect
d- the VP ended at some other time
e- the VP never ended

Now, d) seems quite unlikely. The only Rules that have an effect of any
sort on Voting Periods are R693, R1724 and R1726. In the absence of any
evidence that a Guillotine Application was executed, we can safely
conclude that it is ruled out.

Hypothesis e) is conceivable under the interpretation that "the end of
the Voting Period" is an 'event', that is, a change in some entity's
attributes occurring at a given point in time. This would imply that
Rule 693 operates by 'setting' the a Proposal to into a certain 'state'
at the time it is distributed, then 'setting' a different 'state' when
the prescribed period has elapsed. Since the moment specified, under
that view, by 693/4 for 'closing' the VP of the relevant Proposals
happened before 693/4 became law, that 'event' did not - and now cannot
- happen.

Hypothesis a) implies that the Voting Period is an 'attribute' of a
given Proposal, and, once granted to that Proposal, can only be changed
via the operation of some Rule, under R1011. In other words, as soon as
a Proposal is distributed, it has a 'timer clock' attached to it that
will ring some specified time later, and R639 only operates by setting
the dials on the timer, so to speak.

Hypotheses b) and c) imply that Voting Periods are not exactly
attributes, but more of a legal designation pertaining to acts that may
be legal or not depending on whether they were performed during or
outside of such periods. Thus, R693/4 states that Votes cast between the
time D a Proposal is Distributed and 7 days later are legal, and others
are not, whereas R693/3 stated that Votes cast between D and 10 days
later were legal. The 'end of the VP' under that view is something of a
fiction - the term refers to something with event-like properties. It
can definitely be said that after P3809 took effect, the VP in question
had ended, but from a stricter point of view, the end of the VP as
described by the Rules was the earlier time.

This distinction would matter more for the purpose of determining ASAP
violations; if the difference between the two times had been longer than
a week, then under some bizzarre circumstances the Assessor could have
become technically guilty of Tardiness without being able to do anything
about it.

Now, my opinion, given the wordings of R693, R1724 and R1726, is that
the 'legal designation' model is the one that least stands in the way of
a consistent interpretation of all three Rules. As a consequence, I
sustain the original Judgement of TRUE.

==========================================================================
Justice Steve's Arguments:

I had intended a much lengthier Judgement, which would closely examine
the issues which have been raised in the discussion of thast two weeks.
I find, however, that my fellow Justice Crito has made the points I wish
to make. Therefore, I will simply join him and Morendil in sustaining
the original Judgement of TRUE.
