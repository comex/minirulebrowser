=======================================================================
Changes Since Last Report
======================================================================

Proposal 3680 (Repeal-O-Matic): 0

Proposal 3681 (Murphy): -2
  "All Locations are destroyed" will probably not work (because some
  Locations are defined by the Rules and cannot be destroyed by a mere
  Proposal) and the "100 Structures and 10,000 Ergs are created" does
  not specify where they go.  (There are also wrapping problems.)

Proposal 3682 (Morendil): +1
  A very good salvage effort.

Proposal 3683 (Repeal-O-Matic): 0

Proposal 3684 (Blob): +2 -1 = +1
  There are a couple of harmless errors (e.g. forgetting the word
  "The" before "Promotor"), but the Proposal is otherwise
  well-considered and looks decent.  I especially like how Sane and
  Urgent Proposals are reworked.

Proposal 3685 (Steve): 0
  Too short to merit consideration for style.

Proposal 3686 (Swann): -1
  I am leery of "associating" things with other things.  There is a
  grammatical error in the first paragraph of the first proposed
  Rule.  "can be" should be "may be".  There are a lot of other little
  things that simply grate me the wrong way; for example, Endgame
  Procedures "persisting" (instead of "continuing", which would be my
  preferred choice).  But I'll restrain myself and only charge 1 Style
  Point since overall the Proposal is not that bad.

Proposal 3687 (Sherlock): 0
  Sigh.  I can't decide whether to give this +3 or -3, so I'll give it
  zero.  I have to give credit for writing _any_ Proposal in verse,
  but the meter is contrived and the pun, as the Proposer notes, is
  quite bad.

Proposal 3688 (Repeal-O-Matic): 0

Proposal 3689 (The Stars and Stripes NOW): -2
  I _really really really_ dislike self-modifying Rules.

Proposal 3690 (Jester): +2
  Ok, this is a pretty good job of poetic Proposing.  

Proposal 3691 (Jester): 0
  Normally I'd punish the Proposer for making a clearly pointless
  Proposal, but Jester is new here. :)

======================================================================

Events of Note:

AOTM, Blob and Morendil both lose the Patent Title of Boor.

The following Payment Order in P-Notes is issued pursuant to Rule
  1542:

>From the Bank to Jester, 1 P-Note.

I hereby submit the following Proposal:

     Create a Rule titled "Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of
Margins" with the following text (delimited by rows of asterisks):

*********************************************************************

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of    
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other  
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total   
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,   
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the   
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to    
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting   
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also   
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.

OFF:  New Proposals: 3692 - 3694 

There are three new proposals distributed as of this report.  The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Saturday,
February 21.

I'm distributing these now to avoid any complications with the Proposal Queue,
in case it passes.  Please do not submit any more Proposals to me until the
results of that Proposal are announced.  Thanks.

Repeal Rule 1482

Rule 1482 is hereby repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3693 (Steve)  AI = 1
Split the Assessor's functions

[Comment: a proto to split the two functions of the Assessor -tallying
votes and VT Recordkeeping -into two separate Offices. The major change
that this entails is to the way voting is handled. I've tried to keep
things as simple as possible, by loosening the link between voting and
spending VTs. Under the system I propose, voting results in being billed
for VTs, but voting is not a dual act of both casting a vote, and 
spending VTs accordingly. Compare my proposed R1442 to the current
version to see the advantages of this approach.] 

[Summary: this Proposal creates 1 Rule, repeals 2 Rules (1731, 1653), and
amends 6 Rules (1449, 1696, 1442, 206, 1717, 1547).]

This Proposal has an AI of 2.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "The Accountor", be created
with the following text:

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the
      Basic Officer Salary, and whose responsibility it is to be the 
      Recordkeepor for Voting Tokens. The Accountor's Report includes
      the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each entity which
      possesses them, and any changes thereto since the last posting
      of the Accountor's Report.

Be it further resolved that the Office of Accountor shall initially
be held by the Assessor.

Be it further resolved that R1449 (The Assessor) be amended by replacing
the text "3 times the Basic Officer Salary" with the text "1.5 times the
Basic Officer Salary".

Be it further resolved that R1696 (Voting Tokens) be amended to read:

      Voting Tokens (VTs) are a Currency.  The MUQ of VTs is 0.1.
      The Recordkeepor for VTs is the Accountor.  The Mintor of
      VTs is the Bank.

Be it further resolved that R1442 (Using VTs) have its Title changed
to 'Voting and Voting Tokens', and that it be amended to read:

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting 
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or 
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is 
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform the 
      Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so cancels 
      any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if this is done 
      during the Voting Period of that Proposal. Cancelled votes are not 
      counted by the Assessor and do not count towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

Be it further resolved that R1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) be repealed.

[Comment: no longer needed.]

Be it further resolved that R206 (Voting Entities and Votes) be amended 
by deleting from it the text:

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the casting of 
      Voting Tokens, as specified in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that R1717 (The Senate) be amended by replacing
the text in which currently reads:

      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

with text which reads:

      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

Be it further resolved that R1653 (Groups and Unity Vote) be repealed.

[Comment: a rarely used white elephant not worth saving.]

Be it further resolved that R1547 (Some Organizations Can Cast VTs)
have its Title changed to "Some Organizations Can Vote" and that it
be amended to read: 

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

[Comment: Votes are cast; Voting Tokens are spent.]

Proposal 3693 (Time Agent)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
(Untitled)

Create a Rule titled "Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of
Margins" with the following text (delimited by rows of asterisks):

*********************************************************************

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of    
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other  
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total   
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,   
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the   
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to    
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting   
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also   
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.
