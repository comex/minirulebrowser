                               CFJ 1080

   particular time, or during a particular time period, and e fails to
   do so, then e is not required to perform the action at a later time."


======================================================================

Eligible:    Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve,
             Swann, Time Agent

Caller:      Blob
Barred:
On request:

======================================================================
History:

  Called by Blob, 20 Jan 1998 14:01:45 +1100
  Assigned to Morendil, 21 Jan 1998 12:59:58 +0000
  Judged FALSE, 28 Jan 1998 09:53:27 +0100


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The rules are unclear on this. Some Officers have taken it upon
themselves to play catch-up when they missed a report, but the rules
do not necessarily require this. (In some cases they might not even
permit it, especially if it involves making Payment Orders and the like.)


======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

This is a broad (some might say overbroad) statement about the Rules.
As such it should be Judged TRUE if it is true in all instances to
which it can possibly apply, and FALSE if there are some instances
in which it doesn't.

As a general observation, I would like to note that my understanding
of the term "requirement" implies that, short of the Rules explicitly
absolving a Player of a given requirement, as do Rules 1584
(Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players) and 1585 (Official Duties
upon Officer Change), the only way that a Rule-mandated requirement
can cease to apply is for the action required to be performed, or the
Rule or Rules involved to be amended such that they no longer
require that particular action.

The Caller's argument, however, involves a specific kind of
requirement - or rather two specific classes of requirements, and I
must also add that it would have been more appropriate to address a
similar Statement for each such class : requirements to perform an
action at a specific time, and requirements to perform an action
within a particular period of time.

Two 'archetypal' examples will suffice to illustrate each of the
classes covered by the Statement and rephrase the problem it raises:

* If a Rule requires a Player to perform an action at the beginning
   of the Nomic Week, and that Player fails to do so, does the
   requirement on that Player to perform that action remain ?

* If a Rule requires a Player to perform an action as soon as
   possible (which implies 'within 7 days'), and that Player fails to
   do so, does the requirement on that Player to perform that action
   remain ?

Game Custom strongly suggests that in some instances - in fact quite
a few - the answer to the above questions is "yes"; witness delayed
Lotteries or Frankenstein Monster selections of months past.

In both cases, I think that it is sufficient, to find the Statement
FALSE, to note that it would imply that, in a large number of cases,
failure to perform an action required of a Player absolves that
Player of said requirement. This does not square with the expected
meaning of "requirement", and I find nothing in the Rules that would
support such a drastic redefinition of the term.

The issue of the mechanism whereby a Rule which imposes a requirement
to perform an action and places additional strictures, such as a
specific time or period of time when that action must be performed,
or a frequency with which the action must be performed, has been
raised, partly as an objection to the above appeal to the natural
meaning of a "requirement".

In particular, it has been observed that once the time or period of
time specified by a Rule for a required action is past, it becomes
obviously impossible to fully comply with such a requirement - the
implication being that such a requirement cannot be fulfilled,
leaving us with only two alternatives neither of which is palatable :
that such requirements, if not fulfilled at or within the specified
time,  cannot be fulfilled at all and remain imposed for all time; or
that such requirements are no longer imposed after the specified time
or period of time is past.

However, enough likely alternatives have been presented in
discussion; notably, that such a provision might in fact impose
multiple requirements - for instance, one to perform the action, the
other to perform it at or within the specified time.

The hypothesis of this or a similar mechanism is borne out by both
the Rules and Game Custom. An almost ideal example is actions
required "as soon as possible"; of these, Rule 1023 explicitly
states that

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.

Thus, in the case of ASAP actions, failure to perform within the
time period specified does not otherwise alter the significance of
performing such an action at a later time. I contend that this should
in particular be taken to mean that the requirement to perform the
action itself remains after the ASAP-imposed period is past.

As an additional example, Rule 1007 states : "At the beginning of
each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay out to each Officer the
designated Salary for each Office that Officer has held without
interruption for the entire five days preceding."

Such a requirement is arguably impossible to fulfill, given our
definition of "the beginning of the Nomic Week" as a moment with no
duration. On the other hand, Game Custom strongly suggests that such
actions do remain required even after the beginning of the Nomic
Week.

I do not believe there is a need at this time to decide in favor of
the 'multiple requirements' hypothesis over other, potential
hypotheses which might do as well, or better, in resolving the
issue; that at least one such hypothesis exists is, again, enough in
my opinion to find the Statement FALSE.

  Judged TRUE, with injunction, 27 Jan 1998 13:24:40 -0800


======================================================================

Injunction:  I hereby retract Harlequin's win.  Harlequin's
             Champion's Reward is hereby revoked, and any benefits
             thereof are no longer valid.  The Registrar must vacate
             the 10 VT PO due to this false win.  Any other benefit
             or reward that is not specifically named herein that is
             a direct result of said false win must also be
             removed/deleted/returned.


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Harlequin alleges that he did win the Game at that time, due
to Rule 1729.  I present two separate arguments why e did
not (the second applies only if the Judge rejects the first
argument).

I. Rule 1729 states, in part,

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

In CFJ 1078, Judge Blob ruled that Morendil *did* vote on P3640,
and thus was guilty of the violation of R1729, despite the fact
that the votes were later retracted.  Thus, in accordance with
CFJ 1078, Morendil did vote FOR it (e voted once FOR and once
AGAINST), and thus Harlequin did not win.

It has been suggested that "vote" can have more than one meaning
in the Rules, depending on context.  I will grant that the meaning
of "vote" differs depending on whether it is a noun or a verb, and
if the object of the vote is an Agora Proposal, Referendum, or Internomic
Proposal.  *However*, I find no use of the word "vote" as a verb
in reference to Agora Proposals in the Ruleset which would support
any interpretation other than that in the Judgement of CFJ 1078.

II. If the Judge rejects my argument above, I contend that Harlequin
still did not win, in that the reason that no one voted on P3640
was because it was against the Rules, and not "due to greed or sin"
as spelled out in R1729.

It has been objected that, as "due to greed or sin" is in parentheses,
it is meant only as an example, and not limiting on the wins which
might otherwise be permitted by R1729.  IMO, without a "for example,"
or "e.g.," in the parenthetical phrase, the most natural reading of
it is synonymous with an equivalent non-parenthetical phrase.

It has also been objected that not voting because it was against
the Rules is also due to greed, i.e., a desire to avoid the
penalty associated with breaking a Rule.  This is an overbroad
and non-standard interpretation of the word "greed."  For example,
my prime motivation in not speeding on the freeway may be a desire
to avoid the monetary penalty which may be involved, but this would
not be called greed.

======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

Discussion:  Caller Chuck's first argument references Judge Blob's
             judgment in CFJ 1078.  I find that the same reasoning
             applies in this case.

             Since Morendil was found to have voted in that case, it
             matters not that the vote was later retracted.  Morendil
             did, indeed, vote FOR P3640, thus disallowing Harlequin
             a win by R1729.

Note:        Due to this line of reasoning, it will be quite easy to
             prevent any Player from winning by Rule 1729 by simply
             having at least one player vote FOR an Insane Proposal
             and then immediately retract it.  If someone wishes to
             remedy the situation, R1729 will have to be amended to
             state something along the lines of only counting the
             final tally in determination of a win.
