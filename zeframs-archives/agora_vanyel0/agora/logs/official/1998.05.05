I hereby report that Morendil and Harlequin have committed the
Infraction of Inciting to Riot for being continuously Rebellious for a
period of a month or more. 

As of this report they both become Abiding.  I also order the
following Indulgence payments: 

Morendil to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank (RIPO10)
Harlequin to pay 1 Indulgence to the Bank (RIPO11)

(The fact that Morendil has become Abiding does not alter the fact
that he had been  rebellious for a month when the new rule defining
this Infraction was passed.  I therefore believe him to have been
liable.)

Registrar Michael.
