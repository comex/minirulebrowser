I hereby declare that it has been found that my call for Nominations for the
Office of Justiciar was correct after all. Nominations can still be entered.

I hereby open an Election for the Office of Ambassador. Nominations can be
sent in for a period of one week, starting now.

I had intended to let this wait until it was clear whether the Office would
remain in existence, but the Voting Period crisis seems to be able to last
some more time, and I decided to wait no longer.

Andre, (temporary) Registrar

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

When P3809 took effect, it set the Voting Period to seven days.
Proposals 3810-3812 were distributed on Mon, 30 Nov 1998 at 07:29:29
(GMT).

Now there are, as far as I can see, three possible hypotheses as to when
the Voting Period on these proposals ends:

     i) Seven days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

    ii) Ten days after they were Proposed,
        at 07:29:29 (GMT) on Thursday, December 10.

   iii) At the time P3809 took effect,
        at 07:55:39 (GMT) on Monday, December 7.

Now I don't have any particular opinion as to which of these is true,
but I note that it doesn't make much practical difference whether it is
(i) or (iii), as no votes were cast during this period. The times
mentioned in the Statement are the times of the last recorded

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I rule true.

I have read the arguments. i think votes that were legal when cast
counted.  I don't buy that the VP was changed for all past proposals
were changed.
