The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Proposal  (Chuck) AI = 5
CounterScam the Veto Scam, Part II

The Rule entitled "A Monument to the Threat" is hereby repealed.

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then a Rule, entitled "A Win for
Non-Threat" is hereby created, with the following text:

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" win the game upon creation
      of this Rule.  This takes precedence over Rules that would
      prevent any of them from winning the game at that time.

      Any Threat Trombones in existence are hereby destroyed.

      All Players who did not win the game upon the creation of
      the Rule entitled "A Win for Threat" are granted the Patent
      Title "Threat Trombone Mute".

      Chuck is granted the Patent Title "CounterScamster".

      This Rule shall repeal itself at 12:00 GMT on 15 April 1998.

[Comment: A Win for everyone might seem a little extreme, but
if everyone else doesn't get a reward at least that given
to certain people by the Veto Scam, why not just vote down
the Veto Scam?

I'd like to limit the win and PT to those voting FOR Part I,
but I'm afraid that would run afoul of R1003.]

Rule 955 is amended by appending a paragraph reading

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

[Comment: Close this loophole.]

If Proposal 3710 has been adopted, then the Rule whose text
begins, "No instrument can create, or empower another entity to create,"
has its Power set to 3, and is amended to read as follows; if
Proposal 3710 has not been adopted, then a Rule is created with Power=3
and text as follows:

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

[Comment: much shorter and more effective than Swann/Threat's
version.  Theirs has several problems.  First, does not
prevent an intrument from *changing* the Power of another.
Second, sets a Proposal's Power *before* it is adopted.
(Just look at what I did here with such a loophole!  Even
though TGOVSP seems to guard against that by not allowing
a Proposal to "take effect" until it's adopted, it's
still a dangerous precedent, IMO.)  R594 sets the Power of
a Proposal once it's adopted, anyway.  Also, their "Proposals
are explicitly exempt from this provision" is unclear--are
Proposals exempt as the creating entity, the created entity,
or both?  They have to throw in an extra prohibition on
Proposals later to make up for their ambiguity.  Finally, got
rid of the final paragraph, setting the default Power of
instruments to 1, as I'm not fond of having instruments
other than Proposals and Rules anyway, and I don't want to
encourage it.]

Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)

Rule 1663 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
A Scoring nitpick

Amend 1784 by appending the paragraph

      When the Trustee of an entity in Probate resigns as Trustee e
      loses three points. The Notary must order this score change.

[Comment: Trustees perform a service to the Agora community, and they
should be rewarded for it (see "Rewards for Trustees). Scores measure
the degree of a player's activity in Agora, and they should reflect
refusals to serve the community.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No Trustees on hold

Amend 1757 by replacing the string

"          or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee."

with 

"       d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee;
           or
        e) e goes on hold."

[Comment: The probate procedure is slow enough as it is; this will
make the effect of going on hold for trustees similar to that for
officers. If someone goes on hold just to get rid of eir trusteeship
(and, possibly, other offices) and to avoid the score penalty for
resigning in my Proposal "A Scoring nitpick", well, so be
it. Delegating offices and other cleanup before going on hold will
probably be more work than simply finishing the trustee's job.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Vacated blots and scores

Amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The Herald must order this Score change.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No PI for players on hold

Amend 1713 by replacing the second sentence with the following text:

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a 
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order 
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1706 (Locations)

Rule 1706 is hereby Repealed.

Amend R869 by deleting the text:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend R1016 by replacing the text:

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis
      Chamber.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

with the text:

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e announces in the Public
      Forum that e goes On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the Public
      Forum that e comes Off Hold.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours
      after e last went On Hold.

Amend R1664 by replacing the text:

                                             A Player whose Location
      is the Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from
      Rebellious to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum
      saying e does change so. 

with the text:

      A Player can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from
      Rebellious to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum
      saying e does change so. 

Repeal Rule 1707.
Repeal Rule 1708.
Repeal Rule 1709.
Repeal Rule 1710.
Repeal Rule 1711.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Tabula Rasa

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, too many VTs. Time
to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all obligations
      on the Chancellor to transfer Currency incurred under the
      authority of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are
      cancelled. Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any
      Player as Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank)
be repealed.

[Comment: As Scott points out, after Omnibus Reform, this Rule is
superfluous, since Players can vacate inadvertent transfers. So why
keep the reference to R1754 in the provision above if the Rule is
being repealed? Because I'm not sure that the repeal of the Rule
would result in the cancellation of obligations already incurred
under its authority before its repeal.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
No Quorum Tools

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1760 (Quorum Buyback) and 1761
(Quorum Without Objection) be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Murphy) AI = 1
Plots

[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes precedence over any
      Rule attempting to prevent Churches from having this effect.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
B.N. for Kolja A.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, Kolja A. is granted the Degree of
Bachelor of Nomic for the thesis "Metagaming or Roleplaying - two
Approaches to Playing Nomic".

======================================================================
Proposal 3725 (Steve) AI = 1
Tabula Rasa

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, too many VTs. Time
to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all obligations
      on the Chancellor to transfer Currency incurred under the
      authority of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are
      cancelled. Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any
      Player as Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank)
be repealed.

[Comment: As Scott points out, after Omnibus Reform, this Rule is
superfluous, since Players can vacate inadvertent transfers. So why
keep the reference to R1754 in the provision above if the Rule is
being repealed? Because I'm not sure that the repeal of the Rule
would result in the cancellation of obligations already incurred
under its authority before its repeal.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]

======================================================================
Proposal 3726 (Steve) AI = 1
No Quorum Tools

Be it hereby resolved that Rules 1760 (Quorum Buyback) and 1761
(Quorum Without Objection) be repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3727 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
B.N. for Kolja A.

Upon the adoption of this proposal, Kolja A. is granted the Degree of
Bachelor of Nomic for the thesis "Metagaming or Roleplaying - two
Approaches to Playing Nomic".

======================================================================
Proposal 3728 (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)

Rule 1663 is hereby Repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3729 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
A Scoring nitpick

Amend 1784 by appending the paragraph

      When the Trustee of an entity in Probate resigns as Trustee e
      loses three points. The Notary must order this score change.

[Comment: Trustees perform a service to the Agora community, and they
should be rewarded for it (see "Rewards for Trustees). Scores measure
the degree of a player's activity in Agora, and they should reflect
refusals to serve the community.]
