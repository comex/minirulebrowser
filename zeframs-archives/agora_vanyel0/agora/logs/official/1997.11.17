Swann is currently holding the Office of Commander-in-Chief
temporarily as a result of Vlad's appointment of him to that
position.  This requires me to initiate an election to fill this
position. 

I therefore call for Nominations for the Office of
  Commander-in-Chief.  

Nominations must be sent to me within one week. 

Michael.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

H. Assessor take note, G. Chaos has committed the Infraction of Excess
Proposing for Proposal 3608 and is hereby commanded to pay .5 VTs to the Bank.

======================================================================
Proposal 3601 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Read the Ruleset Week

A rule shall be created with the Title "Read the Ruleset Week" and
text as follows:

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

[There's part of me that would rather do it sooner, but December
is already getting into holidays, not to mention finals for those
of us who are students, and many players are away in the early part of
January.  Anyway, I think it would be good to encourage players to
read the whole entire Ruelset at least once a year.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3602 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Stars and Stripes Forever

A Rule shall be created with the Title "The Stars and Stripes Forever"
and text as follows:

      When Rule 1776 is created, the Rulekeepor shall pay out, to
      the Entity which proposed the Proposal which created Rule 1776,
      13 VTs.  Once that has taken place, this Rule repeals itself.

      If Rule 1776 is not created by a Proposal, this Rule repeals
      itself upon creation of Rule 1776.

[I welcome similar proposals recognizing other nations.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3603 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Innocent Error Defense

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1575 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading 

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

======================================================================
Proposal 3604 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Allow Mandated Vacation

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1599 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph beginning "If a Player who ..." with

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it, unless e was
      required by the Rules to vacate that particular Order.

======================================================================
Proposal 3605 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No Doubling-Up 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      A given Transfer Order may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

======================================================================
Proposal 3606 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Clarify PI Infraction

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1713 be amended by replacing "Each
Recordkeeper is authorized to report this Infraction, which" with "The
Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this Infraction
with respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor.  This
Infraction"

======================================================================
Proposal 3607 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Groups

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 766 be amended, by replacing the
string "An SLC associated with a Group is that Group's Ordinances"
with "Each Group has associated with it an SLC called its Ordinances."

======================================================================
Proposal 3608 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Vizier Specification

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 721 be amended to read:

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Vizier shall be
      the Player who authored the ACO that created that Group, if e is
      still a Member of that Group.  If the Group was not created by
      the Execution of a ACO, the Vizier shall be whoever was the
      Vizier of that Group when it was first created.  

      If the Vizier thus specified is not a Member of the Group, the
      Group shall be dissolved.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 721 be retitled "The Vizier and the
Ordinancekeepor".

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be created with the following text:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.

[The current Rule 721 contains a terrible sentence fragment;
 furthermore, it has two basically unrelated provisions (Vizier and
 Ordinancekeepor, and Group Voting) lumped together into a single
 Rule.  This fixes the atrocious grammar and separeates the unrelated
 provisions into separate Rules.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3609 (Steve)  AI = 1
Left In A Huff!

Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann, KoJen, Zefram
and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In A Huff.

======================================================================
Proposal 3610 (Steve)  AI = 1
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway.] 

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

======================================================================
Proposal 3611 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Probate and Registration 

Amend Rule 1601 (Probate) by changing the paragraph that currently reads      

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

into

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed, or when that entity becomes a Player.

Amend Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) by appending the following
text at the end of the Rule:

      A Player ends being an entity's Executor in Probate if one of 
      the following happens:

      - That entity is not anymore in Probate
      - The Player deregisters or is deregistered
      - A CFJ, alleging that the Player was that entity's Executor
        in Probate for a period of at least one month in which there
        were no disputed Payment Orders having that entity either as
        their payor as their payee, has been found true.

Furthermore, all persons that are not Players cease to be the Executor 
in Probate of any and all entities of which they are the Executor in
Probate.

[ comment: This causes the following:
  1. Non-Players can not be Executors in Probate
  2. Players can not be in Probate
  3. the 'timely manner' in which a Probate must be solved has been
     specified - one month, but only if there are no disputed Payment
     Orders naming the entity in Probate.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3612 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Repeal-O-Matic II

Create a rule with the following text;
{Title: Repeal-O-Matic}

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

======================================================================
Proposal 3613 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Power of Attorney

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that 
     means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for 
     as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

     No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than two 
     other Players.
