Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 6 Feb 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Contents

1. Results on INP 360-362: There are no INP 360-362

2. New proposal INP360


1. Results on INP 360-362

An interesting phenomenon occured in IN recently: The export of a game
state split from one of the member nomics to IN. 

Within Acka the game was split because it was not clear whether
Malenkais attempted deregistration was valid or not (and, before his
registration, Malenkai was CotC, so the CFJs about the issue would
have to be handled by him in the thread where he wasn't deregistered,
and by a successor in the thread in which he was).

Anyway, for some time Malenkai assumed that he was still a player of
Acka and continued to behave as if he was IN moderator (although
earlier, when he thought he had deregistered from Acka successfully,
he had named Uri Bruck as his successor in this function). Now the
Acka issue has been resolved: Malenkais deregistration did succeed,
and Uri was moderator all along.

However, Uri claims not to have received (and, consequently, not
distributed) INP 360-362, so these never were IN proposals. In
consequence, our referenda on these also weren't really referenda on
IN proposals. So I will just ignore "votes" I received on these and
act as if the proposals never happened. If anyone disagrees with this,
please let me know.


2. New proposal

In consequence, new proposals made now that Uri clearly is moderator
are numbered starting with 360 again. INP 360 is the resubmission of a
proposal that was (not) distributed by Malenkai before, by New
Rioshonnomic:


  Amend the text of rule 215 to replace the string "New Rishonnomic"
with the string "New Rishonomic, New Rishonnomic".  Only perform the
replacement once, not recursively.


The Agora referendum on this lasts until Thu, 12 Feb 1998 11:14:57
+0200. I hope you will see this repetition as a fun curiosity and not
as a waste of your time, so please vote!
