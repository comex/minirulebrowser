Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 8 Dec 1997

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Contents:

1. New Rishon(n)omic fun

2. New proposals


1. The appearance of the nomic called New Rishonnomic (two n's) has
created considerable attention and activity in IN. Most of you who are
interested in IN have been following the discussions in the IN list;
if anyone hasn't and/or wants more information, let me know.

Just in order to help everyone understand the following proposals, a
short recap.

IN has no rule for dealing with typos; IN rule 215, which defines the
voting members of IN via an explicit list of members' names, was
recently amended to include a nomic New Rishonnomic. The second 'n' is
(or should I say was?) a typo - at the time of this amendment there
was a nomic called New Rishonomic (one 'n'), but none with two 'n'.

In the meantime, a nomic called New Rishonnomic (two 'n') has been
created, partly by yours truly, and is now claiming to be a voting
member as listed in IN rule 215. The following proposals were mostly
triggered by these events. More information about this new nomic can
be found on its web pages, 
<http://www.tp3.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/~klaush/nomic/>

Finally, an apology: Unfortunately, I have been away from email for
four days, leaving my office just when all these complications were
about to start. Therefore, some of these proposals are already quite
old. I apologize to those I have kept in suspense by my absence.


2. New IN proposals 

I will list technical info, the text of the proposals, and some
background info.


2.1. INP 353

submitted by Ackanomic

The Agora referendum lasts for one week, counted from the distribution
of this message. (The IN voting period for this will be until Thu, 18
Dec 1997 18:15:58 -0500)

Text of proposal:

>>
Amend Rule 215 to replace the word "Rishonnomic" with the word
"Rishonomic."
<<

[Ambassador's remark: this would be an obvious way of "fixing" the
rule to contain what was intended by the proposers of the amendment
that added New Rishonnomic to the members' list.]


2.2. INP 354

submitted by Thring

The Agora referendum lasts for one week, counted from the distribution
of this message. (The IN voting period for this will be until Fri, 19
Dec 1997 11:20:38 -0500)

Text of proposal:

>>
 Amend Rule 215/7 (Mutable) to read:

 The voting members of this Nomic are: New Rishonnomic, Ackanomic, Agora,
Thring, Pumpkin Patch Nomic, Micronomic II, and InterNomic. The moderator
maintains a list of non-voting members.  This rule may be changed by a
Request to Join (RtJ) from a non-voting member or an Add New Member (ANM)
from a voting member. These are treated as proposals requiring the usual
requirements to be enacted.  The effect of such a proposal is to remove
the word "and" from before the last Nomic's name in the list above and
append ", and " followed by the requesting Nomic's name between the last
Nomic's name above and the period. 
 A non-voting member may only issue an RtJ once.
 If this rule is currently immutable then it may still modify itself,
taking precedence over any rule that denys it that right.
<<

Comment added by the proposers (Thring):

>>
 Currently adding new voting members requires amending this rule, which
could be made difficult.  This rewording allows the addition of voting
members without an amend, and for non-voting members to ask to be admitted
(but only once, so a Nomic that for some reason is not wanted to be
admitted cannot flood the game).
<<

[Ambassador's remark: As Steve pointed out on the IN list, this would
have the unwanted side effect of removing the newly accepted
Bluesmobile Nomic just after they have been made a member (assuming
that INP 352 passes).]


2.3. INP 355

Submitted by New Rishonomic (one 'n'). 

The Agora referendum lasts for one week, counted from the distribution
of this message. (The IN voting period for this will be until Sun, 21
Dec 1997 22:02:04 -0500)

Text of Proposal:

>>
A proposal to create a new rule with the following text:


"
I.
A new nomic called 'PlayNomic' is hereby created. PlayNomic is a
non-voting member of Internomic. Its initial ruleset is as follows:

'
Iron Rules:
--------------
90. PlayNomic is a Charter Nomic of Internomic. Its purpose is to 
develop and manage an environment where players of member nomic of 
Internomic can play various games together.
91. There are three types of rules. Iron rules, Immutable rules and
Mutable rules. Initially, rules in the 90's are Iron rules, rules
on the 100's are Immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable.
However rules subsequently enacted or transmuted regardless of their
numbers.
92. Iron rules may only be changed by an Internomic proposal.


Immutable Rules:
---------------
101 Obey the rules.
All players must abide by all the rules then in effect in the form in 
which they are written down.

102. Adopting proposals.
All proposals made in the proper way shall be voted on. Three
condition must be satisfied for a proposal to be adopted:
1) a quorum must have been achieved.
2) The required number of votes must have been cast in favor of the
proposal
3)the prescribed voting period must have elapsed.

103. 
Proposals Must Be Written Down 

Any proposed rule change must be written down  (or otherwise 
communicated in print or text based electronic media) before it is voted 
on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on. 



104. Retroactivity

No rule may generate any effect that applies retroactively to a time
before the generation of the effect. 



105. 
Making Proposals 

The proper way to make a proposal is to send it by electronic mail to 
the current Speaker. The Speaker must then distribute the proposal to 
all Players. The prescribed voting period begins at the moment that the
proposal is distributed by the Speaker.



106. 
Rule Changes That Affect Rule Changing Rules

Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are 
as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that amend or 
repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule change is 
impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or 
self-application of a rule. 


107. 
Voting Options

Players may vote either for or against any proposal during the 
prescribed voting period. Players should send their vote by electronic 
mail to the Speaker before the end of the voting period. Players who do 
not vote within the prescribed period shall be deemed to have abstained. 



108. 
Permissibility Of The Unprohibited 

Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is 
permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the 
rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or 
implicitly permits it.

109
Numbering Proposals 


The Speaker shall give each proposal an ordinal number for reference. 
The numbers shall begin with 301, and each proposal properly submitted 
will receive the next successive ordinal, whether or not the  proposal 
is adopted.


110. What is a rule change?
A rule change may be one of the following:
1. The enactment, amendment or repeal of a mutable rule
2. The transmutation of a mutable rule to immutable or vice versa

111. Resolving conflicts.
If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or 
more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the 
lowest effective ordinal number takes precedence. If at least one of the 
rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another 
rule (or type of rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of 
rule), then such provisions shall supercede the numerical method for 
determining precedence. If two or more rules claim to take precedence 
over one another, or to defer to one another, then the numerical method 
must again govern.  Mutable rules always defer to Immutable and Iron 
rules. Immutable rules always defer to Iron rules

112. Sovereignty.
The rules may be changed either by a proposal which has been accepted
according to the rules, or by an Accepted Internomic Proposal.



Mutable Rules:
--------------
201. Quorum
Quorum is defined as 50% of the active players.

202.The prescribed voting period.
The prescribed voting period on a proposal is seven days, from the 
moment  it is distributed by the speaker.

203.When Proposals Take Effect  

An adopted proposal takes effect at the moment the Speaker announces it 
has been adopted.

204. The Speaker, Players and Guests.
A player is anyone who is registered as a player. A person may register 
as  a player by notifying the Speaker that e is registering as a player.
Any person who is a player of a nomic which is a member of Internomic 
may register as a player of PlayNomic. No other person may register as a 
player. The first Speaker will be appointed by the Internomic Moderator.

The Speaker is also a player, and may submit proposals and vote on
proposals.

Any player of a nomic which is a member nomic of Internomic may become a 
Guest by notifying the Speaker of PlayNomic that e is becoming a Guest.
Guest may participate in sub games, and may acquire awards in accordance 
with the rules. Guests may not vote on PlayNomic proposal, and may not 
submit such proposals. Guests may not be Referees in sub games.
Guests may submit CFJs.



205. Calls For Judgement.
1.
Any player who has a question or complaint about any matter concerning 
the laws and their interpretation may email their statement to the 
Speaker,
who will then distribute it to the rest of the Players. A call for
judgement is then incurred on that statement. 

2.When Judgement has been called for, a Judge is randomly selected from
among the other registered players by the Speaker. The player selected 
has 3 days in which to accept or refuse the appointment by posting to 
the Speaker. Any player who does not respond to selection in 3 days is 
deemed to have refused appointment. If a selected player
refuses appointment, then a further random selection is made from the
remaining pool. 

3. 
Having accepted the appointment, a Judge has exactly one week in which 
to post an official Judgement. 

4.There are only three possible Judgements:  (1) True; (2) False; or (3) 
Invalid. A Judgement may be accompanied by reasons an arguments, but any 
such reasons and arguments form no part of the official Judgement 
itself. 

5.All Judgements must be in accordance with all the rules then in 
effect.
When the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the statement in
question, however, then the Judge shall consider currently existing game 
custom and the spirit of the game in reaching a decision. 

6. If any player feels the judgement is wrong, e may appeal it by 
invoking an Internomic call for justice. The statement must call to 
change the verdict the of the CFJ, and to what verdict it should be 
changed.

7.
If a statement on which Judgement has been called is Judged to be true, 
and that Judgement is not overruled, it does not thereby become a rule, 
or any part of a rule. It merely becomes an explicit part of currently 
accepted game custom until such a time as it is overturned or
superceded.




206. Required number of Votes.
The required number of yes votes for a proposal to be accepted in 3/5 of 
the number of legal votes cast on that proposal.


207. Each player has exactly one vote per proposal

208. A player may retract any proposal e has authored, provided the 
voting period for that proposal has not elapsed yet, by posting a public 
message to that effect.


209. The Speaker is also the Liaison to Internomic.
Whenever a decision has to be made in Internomic, the Speaker will post
all relevant  information, and specify all the possible outcomes, and 
all the players shall vote on it, by sending at most one vote each to 
the Speaker.
If out of all the possible outcomes at least one receives over 40% of 
the votes, and it also receives the highest number of votes, then that 
outcome becomes the decision of PlayNomic. If no outcome receives at 
least 40% then the Speaker shall present the two possible outcomes that 
received  the largest number of votes, and players vote for either of 
those two outcomes. The one that receives the largest number of votes 
becomes the decision of PlayNomic.
Should it not be possible to execute the second round of voting due to
ties. Then no decision is taken.

The voting period on Internomic decision is 7 days or until all the
players have voted, whichever comes first.


210. Awards Committee.
The Speaker shall appoint an Awards Committee. Whenever there is no 
awards Committee, then the Speaker becomes the Awards Committee, until 
such a time as he has appointed an Awards Committee.
The Awards Committee is made up of 1-3 players. It is the duty of the
Awards Committee to keep track of all awards, tangible and intangible 
given to Players and Guests as a result of participation in subgames.
Should a player decide to transfer any of eir Tangibles to another 
nomic, and the transfer succeeds, then the Awards Committee  need no 
longer track that entity.
' 

II. The moderator of Internomic shall appoint a PlayNomic's First 
Speaker, pending the appointed person's agreement. The Appointed player 
must be an active player of a nomic which is a member of Internomic.

III. Once PlayNomic has a Speaker, this rule will be amended to read in 
full:
'PlayNomic is a Charter Nomic of Internomic. Its purpose is to develop 
and manage an environment where players of member nomic of Internomic 
can play various games together. Initially it is a non-voting member of 
Internomic, although its status can be changed to voting in accordance 
with the rules. 
Should it ever become the case that PlayNomic has no players, it will 
continue to exist, and the first player to join PlayNomic will become 
its New Speaker.'

"
<<

[Ambassador's remarks: This is not connected to the New Rishonnomic
bruhaha, at least not in a way obvious to me. 

For the purpose of making proposals, it does not matter whether the
proposer is a voting member or a nonvoting member, so the proposal is
valid in any case (IN 203).

The proposal as distributed here is the second version. An earlier
version was first distributed by the IN speaker, but then retracted
because it wasn't a proper IN proposal after all. The present version
corrected the formal problems with the earlier one.]

The Ambassador is correct that it has nothing to with the New Rishonnomic
bruhaha.  I discussed the idea several times on the Internomic mailing
list. Many moons ago there was another failed proposal of mine which
attempted to create a Games and Contests structure similar to acka's in
Internomic. Eventually I came to the idea of a charter nomic. This
proposal has two purposes. To create an environment where players of
member nomics can play subgames, which seems a very popular pastime in
Ackanomic. And to experiment with the concept ( and implementation) of a
charter nomic. The initial ruleset, as proposed, is still too large, to my
tase, for a generic charter nomic, but should do for a special case, such
as this.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The following summarizes, I hope, the consensus reached in
discussions between Crito, Chuck and myself concerning the casting of
votes during the period of the infection of R1598. Any mistakes are
my own.

The infection of R1598 invalidated the Rule which defines Transfer
Orders. We accept that this had the effect of making impossible the
execution of any delayed implicit Transfer Orders such as would
ordinarily arise from messages sent to the Public Forum purporting to
be voting messages. Since both Rules 1442 and 206 state that the
casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of Voting
Tokens, it was initially thought that it would be impossible to cast
votes on any Proposals whose Voting Periods concluded during the
period of the infection of R1598. This initial view is reflected in
the Assessor's Report of the results for Proposals 3601-3613, in
which all the Proposals are listed as having failed, with no votes
cast either for or against them.

However, Crito has persuasively argued that this initial view is
mistaken. A closer look at R1442 shows that, despite the connotations
ordinarily attached to the word 'spend', the spending of Voting Tokens
for the purposes of R1442 does not require the execution of the
implicit delayed Transfer Orders which normally arise from voting
messages. It requires only the submission of such Transfer Orders,
and this is not blocked by the infection of R1598. R1442 states
that:

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal...

Since R1442 begins by stating that the casting of any votes may only
be achieved by the spending of VTs, and since the Rule also obviously
accepts that votes are cast when a voting message appears in the PF,
it follows that the submission of the implicit delayed TOs associated
with the votes in a voting message is sufficient, for the purposes
of R1442, for regarding VTs as having been spent. The execution of
