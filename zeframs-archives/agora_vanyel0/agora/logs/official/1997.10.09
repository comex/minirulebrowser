                               CFJ 1048

		    "The Rules lack agency"

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   FALSE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Steve, Vir, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Vlad
Barred:      Morendil, Oerjan
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Vlad, 30 Sep 1997 17:19:46 -0500 (CDT)
  Assigned to Steve, 2 Oct 1997 14:18:49 +0200 (MET DST)
  Judged FALSE by Steve, 3 Oct 1997 17:42:45 +1000 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Rules derive their authority from the General Will of all
the Players. Any appearance of agency then seem to have is derived from
that authority. 

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I Judge that the Statement is FALSE.

The Statement is rather vague, but I intend to interpret it as
seeking to establish whether the game state ever changes except as
the result of human action. Game Custom is clear on this point. We
have many examples of self-repealing and self-amending Rules, not to
mention Proposals which have altered the game state in various ways
(cf RGB II). It may well be, as Vlad claims, that the ability of such
Rules and Proposals to act in the way they do is derivative of human
decisions to give the Rules authority. But it remains true that we
have granted such authority to the Rules. Derivative agency is still
agency.
