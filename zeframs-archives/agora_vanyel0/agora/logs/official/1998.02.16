I hereby order the Bank to pay the following salaries:

(RVTPO1) to Ambassador Kolja A.,        1   VT         
(RVTPO2) to Cartographor Michael,       1   VT        
(RVTPO3) to Clerk of the Courts elJefe, 2   VTs
(RVTPO4) to Herald Crito,               2   VTs
(RVTPO5) to Notary Murphy,              1   VT
(RVTPO6) to Promotor Crito,             1.5 VTs
(RVTPO7) to Registrar Michael,          1.5 VTs
(RVTPO8) to Rulekeepor Chuck,           2   VTs
(RVTPO9) to Wizard General Chaos,       1   VT

(The RVTPO numbers are my internal reference numbers for the POs.  I
understand the Chancellor likes to have individual POs identifiable in
this way.)

I hereby order the Bank to pay Distributor Steve 1 VT for his services
to the game as Distributor.  (RVTPO10)

I hereby order Chuck to pay the Bank 2 Indulgences (RIPO1) and 2 VTs
(RVTPO11) because he has committed the Infraction of Failure to
Report.  (His latest posting of the Short Logical Ruleset did not
arrive at the listserver until after midnight on Sunday evening.)

The Archivist, Assessor, Chancellor and Scorekeepor do not receive any
salaries this week because they have not held those offices
continuously for the last five days.

I also belatedly order the Bank to pay a Speaker's Gratuity of 2 VTs
to Morendil for the month of January.  (RVTPO12)

Michael.

Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 16 Feb 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Results of Agora referenda on INP 360-362:


I received the following votes on INP360:

For: Steve, Sherlock, Kolja A., Crito, Michael

Therefore, I have voted for this.


I received the following votes/declarations od presence on INP361:

For: Kolja A.

Against: Sherlock, Steve

Present: Crito

and the following votes/declarations od presence on INP362:

For: Kolja A.

Against: Sherlock, Steve

Present: Crito


I will therefore vote against these proposals. Let me add that both
proposals _just_ made the required quorum - it would be a pity if we
couldn't get to vote just because we fail quorum on future referenda!

======================================================================
Friendliness Report:

Friendly: Agora, FRC, InterNomic
Hostile:  none

What, already ? Are you *sure* you've read through all that, and 
you've found nothing wrong with it ? Nothing missing, nothing in 
there that didn't belong ? I'm not acknowledging this until I'm 
satisfied you've really done your homework, you know !

Oh, OK, if you insist. ;)

I hereby annouce that Steve is the new Speaker.

In accordance with R786, I am the Arbiter of Succession for the
Office of Speaker-Elect. I therefore announce that the Office of
Speaker-Elect is being held temporarily by Promotor Crito, who
has three days to decline the appointment. If he does so, the
Office will pass to Assessor General Chaos.

Speaker Steve

Herald's Report as of 16 February 1998

--------------
Recent events:
--------------

Date: Mon, 09 Feb 1998 10:12:27 -0500

    Promotor Crito reports that Harlequin is guilty of Persistent Indebtedness
    for P-Notes and orders em to pay one Indulgence to the Bank.

Date: Mon, 09 Feb 1998 16:20:33 -0500

    G. Chaos pays off POI731.

Date: Mon, 09 Feb 1998 16:24:25 -0500

    Assessor G. Chaos reports that Harlequin is guilty of Persistent
    Indebtedness for VTs and orders em to pay one Indulgence to the Bank.

Date: Mon, 09 Feb 1998 14:50:11 -0800

    Time Agent pays off POI732.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 1998 14:36:27 +1100

    Blob transfers a Kudo from emself to Sherlock.

    I hereby transfer one Kudo from myself (Blob) to Sherlock, as an apology
    for acting thoughtlessly when I used eir idea as a political sounding
    board.

Date: Tue, 10 Feb 1998 08:25:52 -0500

    Chancellor G. Chaos pays off the Banks Indulgence POs.

Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998 09:32:56 +0000

    Michael transfers one Kudo FROM Steve TO Kolja A.

  I hereby transfer 1 Kudo from Steve to Kolja A.
  I make this transfer from Steve because he and his cohorts' little
  loophole exploitation is going to cause me a lot of work for little
  point.  Sure Steve gets to be Speaker and they hold onto their
  offices, but most Elections tend to be won by incumbents who bother
  to stand anyway.  Unless my interpretation of the rules is wrong,
  they have also fouled up in their attempt to hold on to the CotC
  job, and I encourage someone not of the Threat to stand in the
  election for this post.

  I make this transfer to Kolja A. because of his enthusiasm as
  Ambassador, and his sterling work in that role. 

    Michael also transfers one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Time Agent.

  I further transfer 1 Kudo from General Chaos to Time Agent. 
  This is done because I feel like it.

Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998 05:01:57 -0500

    G. Chaos transfers one Kudo FROM Michael TO Steve.

    I hereby transfer one Kudo from Michael to Steve, because "I feel like
    it" is not a reasonable justification for a Kudo transfer.

Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998 19:55:58 -0600

    Chuck transfers one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Michael.

    I hereby transfer one Kudo from General Chaos, because e justified
    only half of eir Kudo transfer, to Michael, in compensation for
    this hypocritical transfer from him and in recognition of
    his service as Registrar.

Date: Sun, 15 Feb 1998 16:31:51 +1100

    Steve transfers one Kudo FROM Michael TO G. Chaos.

    I hereby transfer a Kudo, 

    FROM Michael, for complaining about having to do his job,
    TO   General Chaos, for sterling work as Assessor and Chancellor.

Date: Sun, 15 Feb 1998 21:20:32 +1100

    Jester transfers one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Sherlock.

    Herald, I hereby transfer one Kudo from G.Chaos for effectively
    negating the penalty of Michael's first (legitimately reasoned)
    Kudo transfer, without giving a satisfactory reason for the
    transfer to Steve. I transfer this Kudo to Sherlock as e has been
    making an effort to contribute to the game.

    Jester transfers one Kudo FROM Time Agent TO G. Chaos.

    Herald, I hereby transfer one Kudo from Time Agent to G.Chaos as this
    effectively reverses the original 'bad' transfer. I transfer the Kudo
    from Time Agent as I believe that Kudos should be given for a reason
    and the Kudo in question was not given with reasonable justification.
    I transfer it to G.Chaos as I believe that Kudos should be taken for
    a reason and the Kudo in question was not taken without reasonable
    justification.

    Jester's attempt to transfer another Kudo from emself to Time Agent
    fails, since it is too soon.

Date: Sun, 15 Feb 1998 19:36:09 -0500

    Assessor G. Chaos reports that Harlequin is guilty of Persistent

Date: Mon, 16 Feb 1998 09:04:03 +0000

    Michael transfers one Kudo FROM Steve TO Morendil.

    I transfer a Kudo from Steve, for forgetting his Agoran ethics, to
    Morendil, because he has been cruelly ousted from the Office of
    Speaker, one in which he was performing very well.

Date: Mon, 16 Feb 1998 09:43:44 +0000

    Registrar Michael reports that Chuck is guilty of Failure to Report

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
