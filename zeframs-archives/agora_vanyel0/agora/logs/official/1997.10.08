                               CFJ 1047

    "General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial."

======================================================================

Judge:       Michael

Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, Elde, 
	     elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, 
             Murphy, Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Morendil
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Swann

Injunction: 

By R1504/5 I am required to enjoin the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalise General Chaos for
the Crime he has committed.  (R1431 states that Wrongful COE denial is
a Class 1 Crime, and R1505 states that such crimes bear a 1 Blot
penalty.)

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 27 Sep 1997 03:15:17 +0100
  Assigned to Michael, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

> You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
> being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
> indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
> Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
> making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
> victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Reasons and arguments Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.

======================================================================

Decision Judge:

I hereby Judge as follows:

977: TRUE
998: FALSE
1001: TRUE

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

I hereby overturn Zefram's Judgements of CFJ 998 and 1001, in each
case ruling instead for dismissal. Judge Zefram was required by R1563
and by Rule 1565(iii) and (vi) to dismiss the CFJs.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar:  DISMISS  (vacating the Judgement)

I find the Judgement incorrect:  the CFJ should be dismissed under Rule
1565(iii), as the statement does not relate to matters relevant to the
Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

As for the statements of both CFJ 998 and CFJ 1001 the truth or falsity
cannot be determined by logical reasoning, and the statement also does
not relate to a matter relevant to the rules, I OVERTURN the Judgement,
and call for Dismissal of these CFJs. I also remark that the Judgements in
most other CFJs between 945 and 1044, and CFJ 1045, show that the
majority of Agorans agrees with this.
