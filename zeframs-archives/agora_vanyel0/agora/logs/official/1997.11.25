======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments of Judge:

All rise for the right honorable Judge Crito, court is in session.  Be seated.

First, neither the original Transfer Order nor this CFJ make a clear
specification as to which "Plato" they are referring.  The CFJ does not even
make it explicitly clear that the "Plato" of the CFJ is the same as the "Plato"
of the Transfer Order.  However, the timing of the messages, the amount of VTs
specified in both messages, and common sense make an implicit link between the
two "Plato"s and the court finds this to be sufficient evidence that the two
messages refer to the same entity.  Furthermore, previous references to "Plato"
within Agora communications, the notoriety of one particular Plato, and the
lack of indications in these messages to the contrary, lead this court to
conclude that it is reasonable to assume the entity referred to as Plato in
these messages is the long since deceased, Greek philosopher.  It is the
opinion of this court, then, that these two messages unambiguously refer to the
Greek philosopher, Plato.

Next, the court must decide what it means to "possess" VTs.  Plato, being
deceased, is incapable of possessing anything in the physical sense.  It is
tempting to return a judgement of FALSE simply on these grounds.
Unfortunately, since VTs are an abstract entity, no one, living or dead, is
capable of physically possessing any VTs.  The Ruleset is replete with
references to Players and entities "possessing" such abstract entities -
Currencies, Kudos, Blots, etc.  It is clear then that the condition of an
entity "possessing VTs" is the condition that the Recordkeepor for VTs is
required by the Rules to record the fact that VTs are owned by that particular
entity.  No physical possession or capacity for physical possession is
required.

How can such a condition be met?  In the current context of this CFJ, the
existence of a valid, successfully executed Transfer Order establishes the
requirement for recording VT ownership per Rule 1598.  So now this court must
decide whether Zefram's message of Oct 29, 1997 which purported to transfer .9
VTs from emself to Plato was a valid, successfully executed Transfer Order.

There is no dispute that Zefram possessed at least .9 VTs at the time e sent
this message and that the format of the message was valid according to the
specifications laid out in R1598.  The validity of the Transfer Order then
depends on the validity of the deceased philosopher Plato as a destination
entity.  This becomes the crux of the CFJ.

The court notes that there is no definition of "entity" within the Rules.
However, whatever definition is used, it is clear that a person falls within
this definition.  Does death deprive a person of personhood?  No.  Death is a
property of a person, therefore any person, living or dead, must be considered
an entity for the purposes of R1598.  Does the property of being dead deprive a
person of the capacity of possessing VTs?

First, there is no statutory prohibition that prevents a person from possessing
VTs based on any of that person's properties.  Secondly, the death of a person,
absent explicit legal prohibitions, cannot prevent the VT Recordkeepor from
physically recording the possession of VTs by that person, nor can it prevent
the Rules from logically requiring the VT Recordkeepor to make such a record.

It is the opinion of this court that the Transfer Order issued by Zefram,
asking that .9 VTs be transferred from emself to Plato, was valid and legally
executed on October 29, 1997.  This stems from the fact that there is no
requirement for Plato to physically possess .9 VTs and there is no legal or
physical impediment preventing the Assessor from recording the effects of this
Transfer Order.  Therefore, the statement of CFJ 1062 must be considered true.
A judgement of TRUE is hereby entered.

All rise.  Court is adjourned.

-- Crito


======================================================================
Decision of Speaker (as was) Morendil:  SUSTAIN

The name "Plato", as mentioned in the Transfer Order that is at the
source of this debate, does not refer to a person whom any legal
system currently in existence would recognize as having any rights
or obligations.

Were the same kind of dispute to arise in an RL court, the case
would probably be dismissed on the grounds of "no controversy". No
descendants of the deceased Greek philosopher, and more generally no
legal or physical persons are currently charged with protecting any
rights of morality or possession attaching to the estate of Plato.
Therefore, in any dispute about Plato's supposed ownership of any
conceivable kind of fictitious or actual possessions, nobody's rights
are being violated, and there is nobody who might be said to have
failed to perform any kind of obligation.

Now, Agora is not RL, and things that might seem absurd in RL can be
done in Agora for the sheer fun of it, that much is granted. However,
even for the purposes of Agora, the above line of reasoning should
alert us to the fact that Plato is, in all relevant respects, a
fictitious rather than a real person. Transferring some amount of a
Currency to, say, Homer rather than Plato would achieve identical
results; the names "Homer" and "Plato" in such cases serve as mere
labels used by a Player attempting to, jocularly as it were, divest
emself of some of eir possessions without specifying a beneficiary.

Transferring Currencies, on the other hand, to living persons such
as Larry Wall or William Gates might conceivably have different
effects. One may be more likely than the other to develop an
interest for Agora, register to play, and affect game play based on
the amount of Currencies transferred to em while not a Player.

With this distinction firmly in mind, I conclude that attempting to
transfer Currencies to a fictitious person should not be a legal Game
Move, on the grounds that except as stipulated in the Rules,
arbitrary legal fictions should not be allowed to be created to
affect game play.

Couching this in terms of Rule 1011, which seems to be the only Rule
that could, or should, allow us to invalidate such attempts, is
unfortunately a more difficult exercise. It is possible that the
recently adopted term of "Nomic Property", as opposed to the older
"Nomic Entity", does not adequately safeguard against precisely that
kind of abuse of Rule 1598.

I am therefore inclined to let Crito's Judgement stand.


======================================================================
Decision of Justiciar (as was) Steve:  SUSTAIN

I have often remarked before that the transition from a face to face
game to game played over the Internet via the exchange of email messages
brings with it a number of tricky conceptual issues which need to be
worked out in the course of play. The treatment of the virtual objects
referred to in the Rules, eg Kudos, Blots, Voting Tokens and Locations,
is one such area.

Over the years I have been a Player, I have developed a conceptual
framework which I find congenial for thinking about such issues. The
elements of that framework were in part articulated in my Judgement
of the Appeal of CFJ 911. In that Judgement, I rejected a 'numbers
on paper' view of Currency holdings and held that for the purposes of
trying to determine what it means to own Voting Tokens, we should
think of them as being analogous to poker chips or Monopoly money. In
that Judgement, I used this principle to determine that debts are of
a different nature to possessions, on the grounds that a different
kind of poker chip or Monopoly note would be required to represent
the existence of a debt. Here, the principle could have been applied
to deliver the verdict that since Plato cannot possess poker chips or
Monopoly money, having been dead for too long, he likewise cannot
possess Voting Tokens. Had I been the Judge of the CFJ, I would
happily have applied the principle and Judged the Statement FALSE.

However, I am not the Judge of this CFJ, but a Justice on the Board
of Appeals. In my view, also developed over the years I have been a
Player, this brings with it a different set of responsibilities. In
particular, I have often stated my view that where a Justice
disagrees with a Judge over a matter of taste, it is not the role of
the Justice to impose eir own tastes. The role of a Justice, as I see
it, is to correct errors of law where such have been committed, and
to clarify the Rules where they are silent, inconsistent or unclear
by articulating principles of 'probative usefulness', to borrow a
phrase of Scott's. But where a Judge has already articulated such a
principle, perhaps not to the liking of the Justice, but not actually
mistaken in law, it is not the role of the Justice to overturn the
principle articulated by the Judge in favour of eir own. The game is
better served by encouraging differences of opinion to flourish.

Judges, of course, are still required to consider game custom. Where
a prior Judgement has established a principle of interpretation, and
that principle has become well entrenched, I do not think a Judge can
blithely ignore it and deliver a contrary interpretation, not at
least without an excellent argument. Oerjan's Judgement that a Player
receives a message when it enters eir 'normal technical domain of
control' is, I take it, an example of a well established principle of
this kind.

I mention this in order to make the point that I do not consider my
own Judgement in CFJ 911 to be well established as game custom in
this way. As I began this Judgement by remarking, the treatment of
the virtual objects mentioned in the Rules is a tricky matter, and
a subject of ongoing controversy. Although in my Judgement of the
Appeal of CFJ 911 I rejected the 'numbers on paper' view in favour of
the 'poker chip' view, this Judgement did not, in my opinion, settle
the matter for all time. Judge Crito is within his rights to hold and
defend the view I rejected. He does not err in law in doing so; he
merely differs from me in a matter of taste. I therefore rule to
SUSTAIN Crito's Judgement.


======================================================================
Decision of the Clerk of the Courts:  OVERTURN and judge FALSE

I reject the conclusion of the original judge as contrary to common sense.
In the ordinary meaning of the term, a dead person does not own property.
Eir estate may legally possess things under certain circumstances, but the
CFJ does not refer to Plato's estate, even if he has one.

I find it puzzling that the other Justices appear to accept this, but defer
to the original Judge's erroneous view.  Deferrence should be shown where
the differing interpretation is merely a matter of taste.  But as Justice
Steve has pointed out, a Judge is obliged to consider the Rules and Game
Custom, and the Justices should overrule em when these are flouted.  Common
Sense also belongs on that list.  (Rule 217)

CAREFUL and EXTENSIVE research (using the advanced techniques of CUTTING
and PASTING as well as vgrep) reveals that the IDENTICALITY of Rule 1671
in the Logical Ruleset of November 19 and my last record of Harlequin's
Mutation endeavors from October 12 is beyond THE DOUBT of any reasonable
beings.  UNREASONABLE beings among you may or MAY NOT agree with this, of
course.

I therefore SAFELY assume that the ROW of unattended weeks commences
furiously at October 13.


Welcome to the AUTOPSY.  I gently aware you of the current TEXT:

Rule 1671/46 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.


Note ESPECIALLY the sentences between the first and last paragraphs.
There are unfortunately TWELVE of these, NOT a prime number.

I RANDOMLY select TWO of these.  WHILE I do have a dodecahedron from
my role-playing days, I once did rather extensive studies, published
in the CLUB MAGAZINE, that indicated it was not FAIR.  So I shall
instead use my trusted bash SHELL $RANDOM VARIABLE, which is probably
EVEN worse.

This carefully requires a METHOD to be developed.  It would be
excessive to repeat the process until a result 1-12 is found, since
the variable APPEARS to give numbers 0-32767.

METHOD HOW I SELECT NUMBER 1-12: I SELECT a number 0-31 in the obvious
way, by Then I select a number 0-2 in an EQUALLY obvious way.  Finally, I
find that number 1-12 some is congruent to the first modulo 4 and to the
second modulo 3.

First selection.  $RANDOM gives 16509, that is, 16 is 0-31.  New $RANDOM
gives 23198, that is, 2 is 0-2.  By a quick calculation, the number 1-12
is _8_.  THIS shall be the number of the first sentence selected.

To select the SECOND sentence, I shall of course have 11 possibilities.
The sentences 9-12 and 1-7, in THAT order.

A NEW CONUNDRUM: How to select a number 1-11.  Obviously I can select 1
number 0-32 and find congruent number among 1-11, modulo 11.

$RANDOM gave 22712, or 22 is 0-32, or _11_ modulo 11. Thus the second
sentence shall be number _7_, the 11th sentence in my list above.

I SELECT sentence 7 to be DELETED:

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.


Now is it time to select a Rule.  101 is the FIRST, 1748 is the LAST Rule
NUMBER.

GROWTH POTENTIAL is important, especially in ALGORITHMS.  The METHOD will
therefore select a TENTATIVE Rule number 0-2047, by dividing $RANDOM by
16, ignoring REMAINDERS.

$RANDOM gives 17974, with the HELP of bc, /16 = 1123. ALAS, TENTATIVE does
not imply EXISTENCE.  Once AGAIN, 18994/16 = 1187.  All these GOOD NUMBERS
not being USED.  17500/16 = 1093.  Alas.  9111/16 = 569.  12288/16 = 768.
70/16 = 4.  572/16 = 35.  24783/16 = 1548.  24129/16 = 1508.  29024/16 =
1814.

ALAS, not YET, but STARS and STRIPES shall not be ALONE.

19094/16 = 1193.  23011/16 = 1438.  17074/16 = 1067.  29570/16 = 1848.

MAYBE MORENDIL will think of something REBELLIOUS?

28829/16 = 1801.  25809/16 = 1613.  28948/16 = 1809.  8640/16 = 540.
13676/16 = 854.  3634/16 = 227.  5409/16 = 338.  31168/16 = 1948.
7637/16 = 477.  18709/16 = 1169.  23347/16 = 1459.  21744/16 = 1359.
22760/16 = 1422.  16540/16 = 1033.  14261/16 = 891.  14730/16 = 920.
837/16 = 52.  10068/16 = 629.  14669/16 = 916.  16201/16 = 1012.
21282/16 = 1330.  8278/16 = 517.  20934/16 = 1308.  1000/16 = 62.
31003/16 = 1937.  7711/16 = 481.  16831/16 = 1051. AHA!

I shall work on EFFECTIVIZING the algorithm before the next report. 
In the MEANTIME:

Rule 1051/10 (Power=1)
The Office of the Rulekeepor

      There shall exist the Office of Rulekeepor.  The Rulekeepor
      shall receive a weekly Salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer
      Salary.

      The Rulekeepor shall maintain a complete list of all Rules.  At
      least once a week, the Rulekeepor shall post the Short Logical
      Ruleset to the Public Forum.  At least once a month, the
      Rulekeepor shall post the Full Logical Ruleset to the Public
      Forum.


I select the FIRST sentence:

      There shall exist the Office of Rulekeepor.

ALTHOUGH I do not have the RECORDS, I know ENOUGH history, alas, that the
temptation of the word "Rulekeepor" would be ruined by 1672 (vi).

INSTEAD, I shall choose the word "Office".

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

This sentence is inserted before the last paragraph of the Frankenstein
Rule, which now reads:

Rule 1671/48 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

A HORRIBLE BUG has been found in the selection procedure for the SECOND
candidate sentence for deletion.

By selecting a number 0-32 from $RANDOM numbers in the range 0-32767, the
number 32 was given TOO LITTLE probability, 768/32768 as compared to
1000/32768 for OTHER NUMBERS.

FORTUNATELY, my GENIUS has found a way of CORRECTING this ERROR in a
minimally INTRUSIVE WAY.

32*(1000/32768-1/33) = 232/33792 = 29/4224 is the PROBABILITY with which
the selection will be redone in favor of 32.

I will select a number in the range 1-4224.

4885, nope, 10205, nope, 17360, NOPE, 4195, YES!

The selection STANDS.

MUTARE NECESSE EST,
Oerjan.

Dear VIC^H^H^HAUDIENCE!

As you may BE AWARE, the number of sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule is TWELVE, a TWICE PERFECT NUMBER.

This is in contrast to the number of paragraphs overall, which is only
HALF perfect.  It is therefore natural that most interest in the
Frankenstein Rule should be in the area strictly between the first and
last paragraphs.

The creating of the new requires the destruction of the old.  The
(MOSTLY) excellent method previously developed is now put into action
again:

SELECTED $RANDOM numbers 27487 and 16829 give 27 and 1, RESPECTIVELY, for
the next step.  Then _7_ is easily seen to be == 27 (mod 4) and == 1 (mod
3).  The 7th sentence is:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

Now, the 3rd, 1st, 2nd, 8th-12th, and 6th DOWN TO 4th sentences, in that
order, are candidates for the second selection:

A new METHOD has to be developed for THIS case due to a discovered bug.
Now, a number 0-29999 will be selected, the SECOND and THIRD digits
extracted, with 00 discarded.  Then the modulo 11 part is THE SAME AS
PREVIOUSLY.

19985, giving 99, == 11 (mod 11).  THUS, the 4th sentence is selected:

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

I CHOOSE the 4th sentence to be DELETED.


Now, once again, a Rule must be selected.  To SPEED up selection the
necessary PROGRAMS will be run with an AUTOMATIC PIPE to enhance
COMMUNICATION:

echo $RANDOM/16 |bc

721, is a Rule.  EFFICIENCY appears DRAMATICALLY enhanced.

Rule 721/7 (Power=1)
The Vizier

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Player who
      authored the ACO that created that Group (if the Group was not
      created by the Execution of a ACO, the Player who was the Vizier
      of that Group when it was first created).  A Group's Vizier must
      be a Member of that Group.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.


Indeed EXCELLENT raw material. I select the following sentence:

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes.

I select the word "Members".

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not entitled
      to cast Votes.

The sentence is inserted after the 9th paragraph of the Frankenstein Rule,
which now reads:

Rule 1671/50 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not entitled
      to cast Votes.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.


DOWN WITH CORPORATE INFLUENCE,
Oerjan.

INDEED, we are in a glorious era of SCIENCE.  ALAS, its pace is too fast
for to enjoy it - we must RUN SCREAMING from place to place.  Such too
with the MAD SCIENTIST, and all this LEFT OVER business.  Though
fasciNATING.

The FRANKENSTEIN RULE contains within it 12 powerful, yet fragile
sentences, of which one will soon disappear.

The random numbers are 21842 and 13799, giving rise to 21 and 1.  Thus the
first sentence selected shall be number _1_:

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

I must select among the remaining sentences: 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,
8th, 9th, 10th, 12th and 11th.

Random is the number 20906, giving rise to 09, or the _10th_ sentence:

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

I CHOOSE the FIRST sentence to be annihilated.  KRAKATOA!


Now we select the Rule:

1358, not a Rule.  327, nope.  372, nope.  21, nope.  1400, NOPE.
1753, NEI.  824, NEI.  643, NEI.  1373, FORBASKA.  277, I THINK some
FURTHER improvement is needed.  1838, nyet.  206, DA!

Rule 206/9 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes may only
      be achieved by the casting of Voting Tokens, as specified in
      other Rules.

I SELECT the sentence

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Voting Entity, and only those Entities designated by the Rules
      to be Voting Entities are Voting Entities.

I SELECT the compound noun "Voting Entity".

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

The sentence is inserted after the fourth paragraph of the Frankenstein
Rule, which now reads:

Rule 1671/52 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not entitled
      to cast Votes.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.


WHAT IS THIS DEMOCRACY THING YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT,
Oerjan.

ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER DISASTER.  Or so one might HOPE, since I am JUST
starting to write this.  It is ripe for disaster with weeks following
merely HOURS APART.

Sentences, 12 in all, are to be DECIMATED.  Or rather, DUODECIMATED.

Random is the number 26934, followed soon by 11753.  With some luck this
might have rhymed.  Instead we note 26 and 1, giving sentence number _10_:

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral,
      Friendly or Hostile.

Next we get to 16034, giving 60 == 5 (mod 11).  SEEING AS HOW I forgot to
LIST the numbers to select among, I must MERELY use the DEFAULT order:
1-9, then 11-12.  THUS is sentence _5_ selected:

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

DECISIONS, DECISIONS.  Neither of them is really up to my STANDARD.  Bad
INGREDIENTS, I presume.

I CHOOSE sentence 10 to be deleted.


Now for the selection of INGREDIENTS.

Our UNRELIABLE echo $RANDOM/16 |bc command shall have to do for NOW, and
provides:

29??? What FOR a Rule number is that?
515? Unlikely, but CHECKING - nope.
523? Hah!
239?

AH, the TALES Ludwig could TELL - but alas, now he has gone OFF the
ROCKER.  Changed his name to ARCHIMEDES and all.  ALAS, most of the COMMON
SCUM don't even see THE difference.

Nope.

973, nope. 1749, WHERE did I see that number BEFORE?
363, nope. 531, nope. 435, nope. 1589, YES!

Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.


Not TOO exciting, a DEFINITE downwards trend from previous weeks.  I
SELECT the sentence

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

MOSTLY for the fun of having TWO VARIANTS of the same sentence.

I select the word "mechanisms".

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

This sentence is inserted just after its sibling in the Frankenstein
Rule, which now reads:

Rule 1671/54 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not entitled
      to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

AH, only TWO more to go until AT MY OWN PACE.

Hastily, WASTILY, 12 sentences are put up for SELECTION:

18380, 4523 giving 18 and 0, or sentence number _6_:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

Remaining sentences:  2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 1st, 12th, 11th, 10th, 9th, 7th,
8th.

24337, giving 43 == 10 (mod 11), or sentence _7_:

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

SEEING AS HOW I just added the latter to keep the FORMER company, and how
the FORMER has been for ages without being used, I CHOOSE sentence _6_ for
summary EXECUTION.


Rules? Where? 1461? 902? 1356? 781? 1544? 744? 1224? 1823? 2017? 1100?
1881? 709? 1188? 1166? 1660? WHOOPS, FOLLOW THAT RULE...


Rule 1660/0 (Power=1)
The Speaker's Vote

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to, once in any
      given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that e is
      otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in addition to
      any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      This Rule does not increase the maximum allowable votes that can
      be cast by a Voting Entity.

I SELECT

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to, once in any
      given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that e is
      otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in addition to

I SELECT "Speaker".

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

This is inserted after paragraph 5 of the Frankenstein Rule, which now
reads:

Rule 1671/56 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not entitled
      to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
