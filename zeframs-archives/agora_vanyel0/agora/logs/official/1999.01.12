Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3821 (Blob) AI = 1
Let everyone have a turn
 
Create a rule, with title "Turns for all", with text:

     Whenever a Player is selected to judge a CFJ, e becomes ineligible
     to judge any future CFJs. If ever there are no Players eligible to
     Judge a CFJ, then all Players made ineligible by this rule become
     eligible again.

     Being made ineligible to judge a CFJ by this rule does not cause
     a Player to become ineligible to serve as a Justice on that CFJ.
     This rule takes precedence over any rule which claims otherwise.


Amend Rule 698 ("Always an Eligible Judge"), by replacing the text:

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

with:
  
      If, after taking all other rules affecting eligibility into
      account, there are no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ, then
      all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to
      the contrary notwithstanding.

[Comments:
   
v1.0: Complementary to the recent R-O-M proposal, although not
      necessarily relying on it. We've had the same judge selection
      mechanism for ages, and while it works well enough, it might be
      interesting to try something new.

v1.1: Added the second paragraph, at Michael's recommendation

v1.2: Amended R698 to explicitly apply only after all other rules have
      had there say.
]
====================================================================== 
Proposal 3822 (Crito) AI = 1
Honour without Dishonour

Let the following Rule be created with Power = 1;

Herald's Privilege
     
      No more than once a month, the Herald may increase the honour
      of a Player, other than emself, by announcing in the Public
      Forum the identity of that Player and the reason for the increase.
      At the same time as e makes this announcement, the Herald shall
      record an increase of one Kudo in the holdings of said Player. 
     
[A nice perk for the Herald, and a way to recognize honorable acts  
of Players without requiring a 'victim'.  I deliberately left the
allowable justifications to the discretion of the Herald.]

======================================================================


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               !
