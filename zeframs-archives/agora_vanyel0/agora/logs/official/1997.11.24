Michael.

Note that the previous report was in error in claiming that Morendil
became Commander-in-Chief when Swann declined to take up that
position.  Instead, it was me, but this was not announced, and now
that Harlequin fills the position in the normal fashion it seems
pointless to record that I held it for such a short and uninteresting
period.

======================================================================
Proposal 3614 (Crito)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Persistent Style

Amend Rule 1542 to read as follows:

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir current
      High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be increased by two
      times the number of P-Notes awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

Amend Rule 1543 to read as follows:

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
       iii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The change in Style, if any, merited by each Proposal
            distributed since the last Wizard's Report.
         v) The reasons for each change.

Repeal Rule 1705

======================================================================
Proposal 3615 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Objects

PART 0: Currency Armageddon

All Currencies are hereby destroyed.

Upon the completion of the Rule Changes in this Proposal,
all entities that, immediately prior to the passage of this Proposal,
possessed the following types of Currencies shall have created in their 
possession a number of like-named Objects equal to the integral number 
(the number, dropping any decimal fractions) of that Currency they 
possessed at the time immediately prior to this Proposal's adoption. 
These Creations shall be detected and reported by the Recordkeepors for 
the Objects in question:

     Voting Tokens
     Proposal Notes
     Indulgences

PART I: Objects in General

Titles given in parentheses after Rule Numbers are for information only.
They are not given to specify any particular Rule, and they shall be
ignored during the application of this Proposal.


The Rule Category "Currencies" is re-named "Objects"

Rule 1467 has its title change from "Definition of a Currency"
to "Definition of an Object"

Amend Rule 1467 (Definition of a Currency) to read as follows;

     There are entities known as Objects.  An entity is only an 
     Object if the Rules designate it as such.  All Objects, and all
     Classes of Objects conform to the following strictures:

       i) All individual Objects must be a member of one, and only one, 
          Class of Objects explicitly defined in the Rules.
      ii) All individual Objects are owned by one, and only one, entity. 
          Whenever the owner of an individual Object is otherwise
          unspecified, its owner is the Bank.
     iii) All Objects are indivisible. Entities may only own an integral 
          number of Objects.
      iv) An Object that is a member of Class X may be referred to as an
          X. (Where X is the name of the Class of Object.)
       v) Each Class of Objects has a Recordkeepor who must keep a
          up-to-date record of all entities that own Objects belonging 
          to that Class, and the number of those Objects each entity 
          possesses.  If the Rules specify no other Recordkeepor for a
          Class of Objects, that Recordkeepor is the Chancellor.

     This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule defining the 
     properties of Objects or Classes of Objects.

{Comment: This begins a general pragmatic infrastructure to replace the
          current currency bureaucracy.  Currencies are to be replaced
          by Objects, with a much more general structure.
          v0.2 followed some suggestions about language.}


Rule 1576 has its title change from "Names of Currencies" to
"Classes of Objects"

Rule 1576 (Names of Currencies) is amended to read as follows;

     Each Class of Object shall have a name, which must be distinct
     from the name of any other Class of Object.

     Any attempt to create a Class of Object with the same name as an
     already existing Class of Object fails.

     Classes of Objects can only be created by the Rules or by 
     procedures explicitly defined in the Rules.

     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that would allow a Class of 
     Objects to be Created in violation of this Rule.

{Comment: v0.2, added a restriction on the creation of Classes of
          Objects.}

Rule 1577 (Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)) is repealed.
{Comment: Objects are atomic entities.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Legal State and Actual State of Objects}

     Every Object has a "Legal State" and an "Actual State."

     The Actual State of an Object is the state of that Object as 
     recorded by that Object's Recordkeepor.  The Actual State of an 
     Object can only be changed by the Object's Recordkeepor. The Actual 
     State of an Object can never be changed retroactively.

     The Legal State of an Object is the state of that Object as it 
     would have been Recorded given adherence to the Rules, perfect 
     knowledge, and absence of error.

     Whenever the Recordkeepor discovers that the Actual State of an 
     Object is not the same as the Legal State of an Object, e is 
     required to alter the Actual state of that Object (Creating, 
     Destroying, and Transferring Objects as needed) to conform the 
     current Actual State of that Object to the current Legal State of 
     that Object.  This change only applies at the time the change takes 
     place, and does not alter any prior states of that Object, even if 
     those states were not the same as the Legal State of that Object at 
     the time.

     Whenever the Rules refer to the owner of an Object, it means the 
     Actual Owner of that Object unless explicitly specified otherwise.

     This rule takes precedence over any Rule that contradicts its 
     provisions.

     Any changes to an Object's State required by this Rule are detected 
     and Reported by the Recordkeepor in question.

{Comment: v0.2 This rule is needed since a few people seemed confused as 
          to the purpouse of the Legal and Actual state of Objects.  I 
          guess I needed to state explicitly that the Actual State is 
          _it_, if the Recordkeepor says you have a VT, you have a VT, 
          and a future CFJ can't say otherwise. (It can say you weren't
          suposed to have the VT, and the Recordkeepor may transfer it
          back, but that's different than an indeterminate gamestate.)}


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) has its title change from
"Currency Recordkeepors" to "Object Records"


Rule 1578 (Currency Recordkeepors) is amended to read as follows;

     Every Recordkeepor of a given Class of Objects must, once a week, 
     publish a report that contains a list of all entities that own 
     Objects belonging to that Class, and the number of those Objects 
     each entity possesses.

     Within the Class of Objects e records, the Recordkeepor must record 
     every change in ownership or number of Objects that is mandated in 
     the Rules, and e must refrain from recording any change in 
     ownership or number of Objects that is not mandated in the Rules.  
     Willful disregard of this provision is an "Abuse of 
     Responsibility," a Crime defined in other Rules.

     If any Player believes that the Recordkeepor has produced a report 
     that states an Actual State for an Object (or set of Objects) which 
     is not also the Legal State for that Object (or set of Objects), e 
     is permitted produce a Claim of Error alleging this.

     Whenever a CFJ (or an admitted COE) finds that at some point the 
     Actual State of an Object (or set of Objects) was not also the 
     Legal State of that Object (or set of Objects) the Recordkeepor for 
     that Object (or set of Objects) must adjust eir records so that the 
     current Actual State of those Objects conforms to the current Legal
     State of those Objects as specified in the CFJ (or admitted COE).
     This shall never alter any past Actual states of those Objects.

     Object Records can be Ratified. The effect of such Ratification is 
     to change the Legal State of the recorded Objects to conform to the 
     Actual State of those Objects.

{Comment: This is the heart of the pragmatic nature of this proposal.
          Like "ratification" this Rule makes a distinct effort to 
          separate what the Game State is, and what our Reports record.  
          This however goes further by creating a "Legal State" distinct 
          from the "Actual State," this is meant to be an analogue, as 
          closely as possible, to our officers moving physical tokens 
          around-- if the officer makes a mistake and gives someone an 
          Object, the Object is actually given, there is no chance for a 
          game state being indeterminate.  The gamestate's what the 
          reports say, period.  The "Legal State" exists to allow the 
          correction of errors, it exists as a model of what the 
          gamestate should be.
          v0.6 Reduced a few redundant passages that were stated in an
          prior rule.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: When the Recordkeepor is not a Player}

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Class of Objects ceases to be
      a Player, and other Rules do not define a procedure for selecting
      a new Recordkeepor, the Speaker shall as soon as possible
      designate a willing player as the new Recordkeepor for that Class 
      of Objects.

      Until a new Recordkeepor is designated, the Speaker shall fulfill
      that responsibility.

{Comment: Part of the old version of the prior rule that no longer
          seemed to fit there.
          v0.2 followed elJefe's suggestion.}


Rule 1579 (Mintors) is repealed.
Rule 1722 (Minting of Currencies) is repealed.
Rule 1471 (Creation and Destruction of Currencies) is repealed.

{Comment: Mintors and Mint Authority are actually a hindrance to this
          reform, in that they add additional conditions to the legal 
          status of moves, and actually increase the bureaucratic 
          minutiae required to perform some basic actions, like 
          Converting an Object.  It also prevents the Object scheme from 
          addressing our "non-currency" Objects like Blots and Kudos.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Legal Changes to Objects}

     To have effect, whenever the Rules specify a Transfer, a Creation, 
     or Destruction of an Object, they must also specify a Player who 
     is to send a message to that Object's Recordkeepor to notify em of 
     the change.  The Legal Change only happens if the following
     conditions hold.

       i) The Rules mandate the change.
      ii) The Rules specify a Player to report the change to the 
          Recordkeepor.
     iii) The specified Player reports the change to the Recordkeepor.

     If all these conditions hold, then the change reported by the 
     Player becomes the Legal State of that Object.

     This Rule takes precidence over any Rule that would permit a
     Legal Change to an Object that this Rule would forbid.

{Comment: Note that this specifies the requirements to change the "Legal
          State" of an object. (see: Object Records)  Note that if the 
          above rule invalidates a move, and we discover it much later, 
          there's still no gamestate indeterminance, at worst the 
          Recordkeepor will have to revise eir records to conform the 
          Object Records to the Legal State of the game, but this would
          not invalidate any moves between the error and the
          correction.} 


Rule 1721 (The Chancellor) is amended to read as follows;

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Class of
      Object, its Name and its Recordkeepor. This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

{Comment: MUQ's and Mintors no longer exist.}


Rule 1599 (Failure to Execute Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1598 (Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1730 (Delayed Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1731 (Implicit Transfer Orders) is repealed
Rule 1596 (Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1732 (Satisfaction of Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1733 (Disputed Payment Orders) is repealed
Rule 1734 (Vacated Payment Orders) is repealed

{Comment: This repeals the Transfer Order/Payment Order bureaucracy,
          cutting down immensely on the paperwork required for simple
          actions.}

Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Transferring Objects}

     When an Object is Transferred it ceases to be owned by one entity, 
     and simultaneously becomes owned by another entity.

     An Object is Legally Transferred when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Transfer, reports the Transfer, the original
     owner of the Object, and the new owner of the Object, to that
     Object's Recordkeepor.  At this point the transfer is part of the
     Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Actually Transferred when the Recordkeepor for that 
     Object records the change in ownership for that Object.  At this 
     point the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Transfer with a 
     corresponding Actual Transfer.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     Transfers that correspond to no Legal Transfers, e is guilty of the 
     Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as defined in other Rules.

{Comment: The language here mirrors the language in Object Reports.
          Yes, theoretically the Recordkeepor could make all sorts
          of real transfers, but that is a criminalized act.  This,
          IMHO, is how "pragmatic" recordkeeping should be handled,
          W/O a mountain of paperwork.}


Create a Rule with the following text;
{Title: Creation or Destruction of Objects}

     When an Object is Created it comes into existence owned by a 
     specific entity.  When an Object is Destroyed, some specific entity 
     with at least one of those Objects has one of those Objects cease 
     to exist.

     An Object is Legally Created when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Creation, reports the Creation, and the owner 
     of the Created Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At this 
     point the Creation is part of the Legal State of that Object.

     An Object is Legally Destroyed when the Player designated by the 
     Rules to report the Destruction, reports the Destruction, and the 
     owner of the Destroyed Object, to that Object's Recordkeepor.  At 
     this point the Destruction is part of the Legal State of that 
     Object.

     An Object is Actually Created or Destroyed when the Recordkeepor 
     for that Object records the change for that Object.  At this point 
     the change becomes part of the Actual State of that Object.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Creation with a 
     corresponding Actual Creation.

     The Recordkeepor must match every Legal Destruction with a 
     corresponding Actual Destruction.

     If a Recordkeepor commits the willful initiation of Actual 
     changes (Creations or Destructions) that correspond to no Legal
     changes, e is guilty of the Crime of "Abuse of Responsibility" as
     defined in other Rules.

{Comment: See comment above}


Rule 1713 (Debt) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever the Rules require that Objects be Transferred from an 
     entity, or that Objects possessed by an entity are to be 
     Destroyed, and upon the report of this Legal Transfer or Legal 
     Destruction, the entity possesses fewer Objects of the type
     specified then are required to be Transferred or Destroyed, 
     the Recordkeepor of that Object shall do the following before e
     makes the required Actual Transfers or Destructions:

     E shall Create, in the entity's possession, a number of the 
     specified Objects so the entity possesses exactly the amount of the 
     specified Objects required to be Transferred or Destroyed.  E shall 
     then create in that entity's possession an amount of Blots 
     equivalent to the number of Objects e Created.  (If this value is 
     elsewhere undefined, the equivalent number of Blots shall be the 
     number of Objects created, divided by two, rounded up to the next
     highest integer.)  This value shall always be at least one Blot.
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify an equivalent
     value of less than one Blot.

     The Recordkeepor for the Object in question is charged with 
     reporting these changes to the appropriate Recordkeepors.

{Comment: There is no such thing as Persistent Indebtedness anymore.  If
          you go into debt, you get a Blot for the Objects you're short.
          Blots become a sort of "negative Object."
          v0.3: I am removing the concepts of Equivalence and
          Convertibility from this Proposal, the concepts are severable 
          enough, and the idea behind all this _was_ to simplify 
          things.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Transferable Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Transferable.  A 
     Transferable Object shall be Transferred whenever the Actual Owner
     of such an Object desires that Object to be Transferred to another
     entity and repots the desired Transfer to the Recordkeepor of that
     Object.
     
     A Class of Object shall not be Transferable unless the Rules
     explicitly define it so.

{Comment: A basic Rule to cover transfers between Players.
          v0.4 clarifed that only Actual Owners can cause Transfers.}


Let the following rule be created;
{Title: Personal Objects}

     The Rules can define certain Classes of Objects as Personal.  
     Personal Objects are only permitted to remain in the possession of 
     Players or the Bank.  If a Personal Object is in the possession of 
     a non-Player entity, then the Recordkeepor of that Object must 
     immediately Transfer that Object to the non-Player Entity's
     Executor, or (if it has no Executor) to the Bank.

     A Class of Object shall not be Personal unless the Rules explicitly
     define it so.

     The Recorkeepor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     changes.

{Comment: There are a number of Objects that we want to restrict to 
          Players. Blots and Kudos being two that come to mind right 
          now.  If we ever re-introduce something like Win Tokens, they 
          should be Personal as well. Note, this is not an automagical
          process, a Blot could exist in a Group "treasury," but it
          would be illegal for the Herald to let it stay there. And any 
          transfer of it wouldn't be retroactive, but only as of the 
          moment the Herald decided to move it.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Objects Changed by Proposal}

     If a Proposal directly orders changes to any Objects, and does not 
     itself specify a Player to report those changes to the 
     Recordkeepors of those Objects, then the Assessor shall report 
     those changes.

{Comment: Prevents a potential conflict with some prior Rules.}


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Reporting Object Changes, Timing}

     Whenever the Rules require a Player to report a change in an Object 
     to that Object's Recordkeepor, that Player shall make eir Report of 
     the change as soon as possible after the Rules require em to do so.

     Whenever a Recordkeepor of an Object receives a report in the 
     change of an Object, and that report caused a change in the Legal 
     State of that Object, e must then make the corresponding change in 
     the Actual State of that Object as soon as possible after receiving 
     the report.

{Comment: Fine point here, a change can be a Legal Change if never
          received by the Recordkeepor, but if so, e's not bound by the
          ASAP clause to make the Actual Change until a COE or CFJ finds
          the omission.  And then the change only happens when the
          Recordkeepor decides to make it.}

Part II: Probate


Rule 1601 (Probate) is amended to read as follows;

      No entity can be destroyed while it possesses any Objects;
      if an entity which possesses any Objects would otherwise be
      destroyed, it shall instead be placed in Probate, and its
      destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an
      entity is a "terminal estate."

      An entity leaves Probate when eir Executor in Probate announces
      that Probate is completed.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses any Objects.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in
      Probate.


Rule 1637 (Wills) is amended to read as follows;

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will is associated with exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity with which it is
      associated, and how the Transferable Objects possessed by that
      entity and its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs
      when that entity becomes a terminal estate in Probate.

      When a entity's Will is executed, the Executor in Probate of that
      entity shall, as soon as possible, report all Transfers required
      by the Will to the appropriate Recordkeepors, excepting those
      Transfers which specify Objects that the entity does not possess.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity with which the Will is to be associated, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity with which the Will is
      to be associated, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will associated with that entity.  Any prior Will
      associated with that entity is destroyed at the same time.


Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) is amended to read as follows;

     Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
     Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
     that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
     appointment in the Public Forum.

     The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
     entity, and empowered only to report Transfers of Objects
     possessed by that entity.  This takes precedence over Rules that
     provide broader authority for an Executor.
      
     The Executor in Probate must do the following upon eir nomination, 
     in the order given, and perform no other acts on behalf of the 
     terminal estate e represents.  E must not initiate a step until the 
     prior one is complete:

       i) The Executor in Probate must first report to the Herald the 
          destruction of all Blots possessed by the terminal estate e 
          represents. E must do so as soon as possible.  This step shall 
          be complete only when all Blots possessed by the terminal
          estate are Actually Destroyed by the Herald or, if the 
          terminal estate possesses no Blots, this step shall be
          completed immediately.

      ii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report all Transfers of Transferable Objects possessed by
          the terminal estate as required by that entity's Will--
          excepting any impossible Transfers, or Transfers of Objects
          the Terminal Estate does not possess-- This step shall be
          complete only when all Transfers required by this step are
          Actually made by the appropriate Recordkeepors, or, 
          if no such Transfers are Required, or no Will exists, this 
          step shall be completed immediately.

     iii) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must report the Transfer of all remaining Objects (if any) in 
          that entity's possession to the Bank. This step shall be 
          complete only when all such Transfers are Actually made by the 
          appropriate Recordkeepors, or, if no Objects remain in the 
          possession of the terminal estate, this step shall be 
          completed immediately.

      iv) Then, as soon as possible thereafter, the Executor in Probate 
          must announce, in the Public Forum, that the terminal estate
          has left Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the above steps,
      that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e announces that
      e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

{Comments: This streamlines the whole Probate process, eliminating the
           overhead created by allowing debt in such a small economy.
           v0.2 avoided elJefe's infinite loop.}


Rule 1739 (The Probate Code) is repealed

{Comment: Without TOs or POs, there's no Debt as such, and no such thing
          as a creditor or a debtor.  Therefore, most of this Rule's 
          function is subsumed by the above Rule.}

Part III: The Bank


Rule 1470 (The Bank) is amended to read as follows;

     There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank is
     permitted to possess any Object.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that would forbid the Bank from owning a particular
     Object.

{Comment: No such thing as mint authority.}


Rule 1735 (The Chancellor as Bank's Executor) is repealed.

{Comment: having the Chancellor as an interface between the Officers and
     the bank IMHO is a needless level of complication.  Better to give 
     the individual Recordkeepors the power to manipulate Objects.


Rule 1479 (Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill") is amended to
read as follows;

     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to pay out some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity receives or 
     gains some number of Objects, that Player shall report, to the
     appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of those Objects from the
     Bank to that entity for the number specified.
     
     Whenever a Rule calls for a Player to bill some number of
     Objects to some entity, or to report that an entity loses or 
     is penalized some number of Objects, that Player shall report to 
     the appropriate Recordkeepor, a Transfer of Objects from that 
     entity to the Bank for the number specified.

{Comment: v0.2 followed some language suggestions.}


Part IV: (ex-)Currencies

Rule 1701 (Proposal Notes) is amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects known as Proposal Notes. (P-Notes)
     Their Recordkeepor is the Promotor.  The Promotor has the duty to 
     publish, at least once a week in the Public Forum, a report of the 
     number of P-Notes owned by each entity that possesses P-Notes, and 
     a list of all the changes in P-Note holdings since the last such 
     report with the reason for those changes.

     The Class of Proposal Notes is Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 Redid the Rule to conform to the changes I made in
          Decimal Objects' definitional Rule.
          v0.4 Decided simplicity was served by axing Decimal Objects.}


Rule 1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals) is amended to read as follows;

      All Proposals have associated with them a Petition fee.  The
      Petition fee for any Proposal is one P-Note, unless another Rule
      specifies a higher fee.  This rule takes precedence over any
      Rule that would require a lower fee, no fee, or a fee paid in
      Objects other than P-Notes.

      The Petition Fee for a Proposal is paid when an entity
      Transfers the amount of that Proposal's Petition Fee, provided
      that e indicates clearly that the Transfer is being made to pay 
      the Petition fee for that Proposal and e makes no other claim
      as to the purpouse of the Transfer.


Rule 1696 (Voting Tokens) is amended to read as follows;

      There is a Class of Objects known as Voting Tokens. (VTs) The
      Recordkeepor for VTs is the Assessor.

      The Assessor's Report includes the number of VTs possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Assessor's Report.

      The Class of Voting Tokens is Transferable.

{Comment: v0.3 see comments re: P-Notes above.
          v0.4 Decided simplicity was served by axing Decimal Objects.}


Rule 1442 (Using VTs) is amended to read as follows;

     The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the Transfer
     of VTs to the Bank, as specified below.

     A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
     Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
     Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

     At the end of the Voting Period, the Assessor shall Transfer enough 
     Voting Tokens from the Voting Entity to pay for the last Vote (or 
     set of Votes) cast by that entity during the Voting Period.

     The Assessor is charged with detecting and reporting these
     Transfers.


Part V: Blots & Indulgences


Rule 1435 (Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate) is
amended to read as follows;

     There is a Class of Objects named Indulgences, which is 
     Transferable. There is a Class of Objects named Blots, which 
     is Personal and not Transferable.  The Recordkeepor for both Blots 
     and Indulgences is the Herald.

     A Player who owns no Blots is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing 
     condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

{Comment: The language fell out neatly given the prior Rules, and 
          finally, after having its status reduced to first a negative 
          value of a "real" currency, then to a Payment Order, a Blot 
          regains its status as an entity in its own right.;) }

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Erasing Blots)

     Any Player who Actually has Blots can erase as many Blots as e
     Actually has Indulgences.  This occurs only in the following
     manner:

       i) The Player notifies the Herald that e is erasing a number of 
          Blots.  This number must be less than or equal to the number
          of Blots e Actually possesses.
          
      ii) If that number is equal to or less than the number of 
          Indulgences possessed by the Player, this notification becomes 
          the report to the Herald of the Legal Destruction of that 
          Number of both Blots and Indulgences possessed by that Player.

{Comment: v0.3 This is a new Rule, because I eliminated Convertibility.
          v0.4 Added requirement that the request be to destroy no more
          Blots than the Player Actually has.}


Rule 1712 (Distribution of Indulgences) is amended to read as follows;

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall, among all
      Players, randomly distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the 
      number of Blots Actually Created in the past Week : for each such
      Indulgence, the Herald shall randomly select one Player and Create
      an Indulgence in the posession of that Player.  The Herald is
      charged with detecting and reporting these changes.

{Comment: Added "Actually" so that there's no ambiguity.  (Actual Blots
          are the ones in the report, which doesn't change, ever, after
          it's made.)}


Rule 1437 (Fugitives from Justice) is amended to read as follows;

     When an Executor in Probate reports the Legal Destruction of Blots 
     belonging to the terminal estate of a deregistered Player, the 
     Herald shall assign the person who was that player a value of 
     Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots the Herald Destroyed.  
     That person becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  Herald shall keep a 
     record of the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive 
     from Justice.

     At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
     value of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
     rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
     number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
     one by this method.

     When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
     Create in eir possession a number of Blots equal in number to
     the value of Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
     reregistration.  Players shall not have Fugitive Blots.

{Comment: Changed a few things to make clear that Fugitive Blots aren't
          an Object, nor do Players possess them.}

Part VI: Objects Not Created by the Rules.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Creation of Classes of Objects}

     Classes of Objects may be created only through explicit definition 
     in the Rules, or by procedures defined in the Rules.

     The Rules may empower non-Rule entities to create unique Classes of 
     Objects. If such an entity creates a Class of Object, that entity's 
     Executor shall be the Recordkeepor for that Class of Objects.

     A Class of Object created by an entity other than the Rules is 
     called a "Common" Class of Object.  The Recordkeepor for any Common 
     Class of Object is permitted to Create any number of those Objects 
     within the possession of the entity that created that Class of 
     Object, e is also permitted to Destroy any number of those Objects 
     in that entity's possession that does not exceed the number 
     possessed by that entity.  The Recordkeepor is required to detect 
     and report these changes.

     Each Player is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects.

{Common: v0.4 Replacement for Mint authority, to allow Group Coins, and
         the newer, player-mandated "Currencies"}


Rule 766 (Groups) is amended to replace the text;

     "Each Group has Mint Authority." 

with this text;

     "Each Group is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects."


Rule 1446 (Contests) is amended to replace the text;

     "Each Contest has Mint Authority." 

with this text;

     "Each Contest is empowered to Create Common Classes of Objects."

Part VII: Cleaning up refrences to Obsolete Terms

Rule 1677 (Currency Awards for New Players) has its Title change
to "Awards for New Players"

Rule 1451 (Disowning Proposals) is amended to read;

      A Proposal is disowned when its Proposer sends a message to the
      Public Forum disowning it, provided that the Proposal in
      question either has not yet been distributed, or less than four
      days have passed since its distribution.  A Proposal can only be
      disowned by its Proposer, and then only if its Proposer is
      neither the Assessor nor has been the Assessor at any time after
      the distribution of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one
      P-Note.  All other payments or awards which would result from the 
      submission of, voting upon, or adoption of that Proposal do not 
      take place, regardless of the outcome of the Vote on that 
      Proposal.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would seek to
      cause a payment or award as a result of the submission of, voting 
      upon, or adoption of, a Disowned Proposal.


Rule 1539 (Regulations and Membership of Contests) is amended by
replacing the word "Currency" with the word "Object," and the word
"Currencies" with the word "Objects."


Rule 1377 (The Herald) is amended by removing the word "Currency."


Rule 502 (Salary for Judges) is amended by replacing the text;

     "If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall vacate the Payment Order paying the salary
      originally received for that decision."

with the text;

     "If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall transfer the salary originally received for that
      decision back to the Bank."


Rule 1736 (Injunctions on Payment Orders) is hereby repealed.


Rule 1737 (Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders) is hereby repealed.


Rule 1661 (The Right of Patronage) is amended to read;

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific Objects from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      an order to Transfer one VT from the Bank to one Player.
    
      The Player to receive the award must not have received a Patronage 
      award within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must
      provide a reason along with the order.

      The VT is Legally Transferred at the time of the Speaker's order,
      an this order is also the report of the transfer to the Assessor.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.


Rule 1653 (Groups and Unity Vote)

      If a Group, during the Voting Period of a Proposal, Actually
      Transfers 3 VTs from itself to the Bank for the purpose of
      declaring Unity on that Proposal, casts exactly 3 Votes FOR or 3
      Votes AGAINST the Proposal in question, and informs the Assessor
      that it is electing to cast a Unity Vote on that Proposal, then 
      that Group has declared Unity on that Proposal.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and all of its Members
      Vote on that Proposal, and all of the Votes of its Members are
      the same as the Votes of the Group, then the Group is entitled
      to cast 3 Votes on that Proposal, at zero cost.  Furthermore,
      the Assessor shall pay out 3 VTs to the Group.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and not all of its
      Members express an Intent to Vote, or not all of the intended
      Votes of its Members are the same as the intended Votes of the
      Group, then the Group is not entitled to cast any Votes on that
      Proposal, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

======================================================================
Proposal 3616 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Nonchallenge of Election Results

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1445 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the
      announced results are the true results of that Election, whether
      or not they be in error in any way.

======================================================================
Proposal 3617 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
No Double Penalties for Officers

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which begins "If the Rules pertaining...".

[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a
document which must be published once each week.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3618 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Fix Indulgence Distribution

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1712 be amended to read:

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

[This was "adopted" during the VT-Free Era.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3619 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2
Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If an entity transfers Currency to the Bank without specifying a
      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

======================================================================
Proposal 3620 (Steve)  AI = 1
Resignation and consent

[Comment: Swann's Judgement of CFJ 1069 exposes a flaw in Rule 880:
a Player other than the Speaker can come to hold an Office without
eir consent. I propose to fix this bug. In the process, I've made 
the Rule a lot more explicit about timing.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 880 be amended to read:

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e appoints another Player to succeed em. An
      Officer who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed
      to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      The Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily
      without consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.
      If the Speaker is appointed, e becomes the new holder of the
      Office at the time of the resignation.

      If the appointed Player is not the Speaker, e does not become
      the new holder of the Office unless e explicitly consents to
      the appointment in the Public Forum in the seven days immediately 
      before or after the resignation. If e does so consent, e
      becomes the new holder of the Office either at the time of the
      resignation, or at the time of eir consent, whichever is latest.  

      If the appointed Player does not consent, and seven days have
      passed since the resignation, and the resigning Officer is still
      holding the Office, the Speaker becomes the new holder of the
      Office.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

======================================================================
Proposal 3621 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Resignation of Offices cleared up

Amend rule 880 to read:

An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e holds.  If
a resigning Officer specifies another Player to succeed them, and this
Player has previously (within the last seven days) indicated their
willingness to so succeed in the Public Forum, then the designated
successor becomes the temporary holder of the Office. 

If a resigning Officer does not specify a successor, or specifies
someone who has not consented to the appointment, then the Speaker
becomes the temporary holder of the Office.

A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically cause
the transfer of any Offices being held by the former Speaker to the
new Speaker.

======================================================================
Proposal 3622 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No nonplayer responsibilities

Create a rule reading:

When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate, officer,
judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy any role or position
to which a Rule assigns any duties or powers.  Noone who is not registered
may occupy such a role or position.  This rule takes precedence over rules
which would prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent Titles, or
any position which a Rule specifically says may be held by a non-Player,
nor shall it act to prevent a nonPlayer from registering, calling CFJs, or
doing things that nonPlayers generally are able to do.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

=======================================================================
Changes Since Last Report
======================================================================

Proposal 3614 (Crito):  -1
  Restates the Rule in whole merely to add one paragraph and replace
  another.

Proposal 3615 (Swann):  -3
  This Proposal was proposed despite several suggestions that it was
  not ripe.  It has numerous flaws, several typographical errors, and
  seeks to set aside a system which has barely had a chance to live.

Proposal 3616 (General Chaos):  0
  Wizard's Proposal

Proposal 3617 (General Chaos):  0
  Wizard's Proposal

Proposal 3618 (General Chaos):  0
  Wizard's Proposal

Proposal 3619 (General Chaos):  0
  Wizard's Proposal

Proposal 3620 (Steve):  0
  An improvement, but I think this Rule needs a complete rewrite, not
  merely tinkering.  It's not Stylish to bludgeon a bad Rule around.

Proposal 3621 (Michael):  +1
  Ah, much better.  If only there was some way to avoid having the
  Office bounce through the Speaker pending consent.

Proposal 3622 (elJefe):  +1
  A good idea; would have been better if Proposed to make a Rule of
  Power 2.

I have often remarked before that the transition from a face to face
game to game played over the Internet via the exchange of email messages
brings with it a number of tricky conceptual issues which need to be
worked out in the course of play. The treatment of the virtual objects
referred to in the Rules, eg Kudos, Blots, Voting Tokens and Locations,
is one such area.

Over the years I have been a Player, I have developed a conceptual
framework which I find congenial for thinking about such issues. The
elements of that framework were in part articulated in my Judgement
of the Appeal of CFJ 911. In that Judgement, I rejected a 'numbers
on paper' view of Currency holdings and held that for the purposes of
trying to determine what it means to own Voting Tokens, we should
think of them as being analogous to poker chips or Monopoly money. In
that Judgement, I used this principle to determine that debts are of
a different nature to possessions, on the grounds that a different
kind of poker chip or Monopoly note would be required to represent
the existence of a debt. Here, the principle could have been applied
to deliver the verdict that since Plato cannot possess poker chips or
Monopoly money, having been dead for too long, he likewise cannot
possess Voting Tokens. Had I been the Judge of the CFJ, I would
happily have applied the principle and Judged the Statement FALSE.

However, I am not the Judge of this CFJ, but a Justice on the Board
of Appeals. In my view, also developed over the years I have been a
Player, this brings with it a different set of responsibilities. In
particular, I have often stated my view that where a Justice
disagrees with a Judge over a matter of taste, it is not the role of
the Justice to impose eir own tastes. The role of a Justice, as I see
it, is to correct errors of law where such have been committed, and
to clarify the Rules where they are silent, inconsistent or unclear
by articulating principles of 'probative usefulness', to borrow a
phrase of Scott's. But where a Judge has already articulated such a
principle, perhaps not to the liking of the Justice, but not actually
mistaken in law, it is not the role of the Justice to overturn the
principle articulated by the Judge in favour of eir own. The game is
better served by encouraging differences of opinion to flourish. 

Judges, of course, are still required to consider game custom. Where
a prior Judgement has established a principle of interpretation, and
that principle has become well entrenched, I do not think a Judge can
blithely ignore it and deliver a contrary interpretation, not at
least without an excellent argument. Oerjan's Judgement that a Player
receives a message when it enters eir 'normal technical domain of
control' is, I take it, an example of a well established principle of
this kind.

I mention this in order to make the point that I do not consider my
own Judgement in CFJ 911 to be well established as game custom in
this way. As I began this Judgement by remarking, the treatment of
the virtual objects mentioned in the Rules is a tricky matter, and
a subject of ongoing controversy. Although in my Judgement of the
Appeal of CFJ 911 I rejected the 'numbers on paper' view in favour of
the 'poker chip' view, this Judgement did not, in my opinion, settle
the matter for all time. Judge Crito is within his rights to hold and
defend the view I rejected. He does not err in law in doing so; he
merely differs from me in a matter of taste. I therefore rule to
SUSTAIN Crito's Judgement.
