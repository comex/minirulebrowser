Hi all,

I should have waited with the Ambassador's report - now there is
something to report. Here are results on INP363, and a new proposal.

H. Promotor and Accountor, please note: I hereby issue a PO from the
bank to myself for 5 VTs, and one PO from the bank to myself for 2
P-notes as required by R1748 (INP363 was submitted by me).

In this context, there is the interesting question whether there will
be a reward according to R1748 if INP364 is adopted - it was submitted
by me, but through New Rishonnomic instead of Agora. While it may not
be the intention of R1748 to hand out awards to Agora players who
submit successful proposals through other nomics, the wording doesn't
make this explicit.


INP363 result:
==============

Agora and Internomic voted for, so this is adopted:

Create a new rule with the text: 

    The moderator should be subscribed to the Internomic mailing
    list. Whenever the rules require someone to communicate with
    the moderator, sending the communication to the Internomic
    mailing list is sufficient to fulfill this requirement. 


INP364:
=======

---
Amend 213 by appending the sentence:

If the nomic selected to judge an SFJ does not deliver judgement on
this SFJ within two weeks, it shall cease to be selected to judge this
SFJ. The moderator shall then randomly select another nomic to judge
this SFJ. E may not select Internomic, the nomic that made the SFJ or
any nomic that had been selected to judge the same SFJ before. If this
leaves no possible selection, the SFJ shall instead be treated as if
it had just been submitted as a new SFJ by Internomic.
---

The voting period of the Agora referendum on this proposal lasts until
one week after I send this message.

Kolja A.
