Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 3 August 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

Uri has now distributed the three proposals made by Agora in the last
few weeks. Here they are; voting on them in the Agora referendum lasts
for one week from now, and remember, voting in this referendum is
absolutely free, it costs nothing whatsoever, just send your vote to
me (Secret Voting does apply, IIRC) and make your voice count for no
price at all. Did I mention that voting on IN referenda is free and
costs you absolutely nothing ? Ok, here goes:


INP 378
Submitted by Agora


HELLO??
Create a rule with the following ...ello?...lo?-delimited text:

...ello?...lo?
If a member nomic of Internomic has not submitted a vote, a proposal,
a statement for judgement or a judgement in the last 30 days, it shall
be considered "Missing".

Other rules notwithstanding, a nomic that is considered Missing cannot
be chosen as judge for any statements for judgement.
...ello?...lo?

Amend Rule 215 by replacing the string "The moderator maintains a list
of non-voting members." with the string "The moderator maintains a
list of non-voting and of missing member nomics."
HELLO??
--------------------------------------------------------------

The submitter made the following comment:
[Comment: This is derived from a similar rule in NRn that is rather
effective in avoiding time delays caused by inactive players.]


INP 379
submitted by Agora


Amend rule 215 by removing the string " Bluesmobile Nomic,".

-------------------------------------------------------

The submitter made the following comment:
(Comment: I've been in touch with the Bluesmobile players - they had
unsubscribed from the IN list a long time ago becasue they somehow
didn't like it. Their recent fun post was triggered by my attempt to
contact them, but they agreed that we can remove them from the voting
members list].


INP380
submitted by Agora

When Nomics Default on Judging

Be it herweby resolved that R213 be amended to read:

      A nomic which has been selected to judge must deliver judgement
      within two weeks by sending its judgement to the moderator, who
      must then distribute the judgement to all members.  A legal
      judgement is either "true" or "false", and must be in accordance
      with the rules.

      If a nomic fails to deliver judgement, then it is removed as
      judge, and the moderator shall select a new judge from among the
      other eligible nomics.

Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1

This Proposal shall have an AI = 1

Rule 1630 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Blob) AI = 1
The Voting Tariff

Crete a rule, entitled "The Voting Tariff", with text:

      The Voting Tariff is a number of VTs, a multiple of the
      MUQ, between 0.5 and 2.0 inclusive. Unless the Rules give
      it another value, the Voting Tariff is 1 VT.

      The Assessor may change the value of the Voting Tariff by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value within the range proscribed above, that
      e makes the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and 
      that e has not already made such an announcement earlier in 
      the Week. The new value of the Voting Tariff does not take
      effect until the beginning of the Nomic Week after the
      change has been announced.

Amend rule Rule 1442 ("The Cost of Voting") to read:

      Proposals have a voting cost, equal to the Voting Tariff
      at the time they were distributed. If there was no value
      set for the Voting Tariff at that time, then the voting
      cost is 1 VT.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity multiplied by the voting cost for
      that Proposal.

[Comment: Yet another parameter for the economy. Gives us a way 
 to handle voting slumps, like the present one, by making voting
 cheaper. But Votes are still valuable, because of the danger that
 prices will go up.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 2
Repeal Rule 1432 (Player Uniqueness)

Rule 1432 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1502 (The Nomic Phone Books)

Rule 1502 is hereby Repealed.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

New Proposals: 3781 - 3782

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report.  The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Wednesday,
August 12.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
S = Sane
E = Emergency
I = Insane
U = Urgent

   3781 Blob           1 Use it or lose it.
   3782 Steve          1 Extend the ban on Presence

======================================================================
Proposal 3781 (Blob) AI = 1
Use it or lose it.

Create a Rule, entitled "Use it or Lose it", with text:

      If, at the end of the month, a Player who has been Active
      for that whole month has not voted on any Proposals 
      distributed that month, then the Assessor shall deny voting
      Privileges to that Player, for two weeks.

Amend Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players not denied voting 
      privileges, or one-fifth of all Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

======================================================================
Proposal 3782 (Steve) AI = 1
Extend the ban on Presence

[Comment: despite the unhappiness of some Players with the absence of
Presence (to coin a phrase), I think its effects have been interesting,
even salutary, and that they warrant further investigation. I think it
too deserves a 2 month extension so we can see how much of our present
difficulties with Quorum (which I think have been overstated in any
case) are due to the ban on Presence, and how much to general summer
holiday inactivity.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be amended
by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two months
      after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this paragraph shall
      be deleted from this Rule.
