3. WILL REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose which entities have Wills, or
anything about a Will's text.  I do so solely for informational purposes.

Summaries of Wills are not guaranteed to be accurate.

All of the Wills marked (*) have ceased to exist for various reasons, and
are listed solely for historical purposes.

----------------------------
Harlequin    all to Order of the Evil Eye, if exists
             or to all Players in Grace Period

*Morendil    all to Misanthropist's Group, if exists
             or to Morendil's Feline Orphanage, if exists and Contestmaster
               is not Morendil

=============================================================
4. PROBATE REPORT
=============================================================

No Rule requires or prohibits that I disclose the identities of
Executors in Probate, except at the time I assign them.  I do so
solely for informational purposes.

Swann is not in Probate.  Others (notably Morendil) may also not be in Probate.

Estate                Executor in Probate

=============================================================
5. FRANKENSTEIN MONSTER REPORT
=============================================================

Required by the Frankenstein Rule.  I hope, but do not guarantee, that this
list is accurate.

No Frankenstein Monster has an Administrator or SLC (and thus no FM has a
Maintainer or Jurisdiction of its SLC).  Each Player's Executor is emself;
no other Frankenstein Monster has an Executor.

Name                             Why a Frankenstein Monster?
