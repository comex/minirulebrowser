======================================================================
Proposal 3753 (Murphy) AI = 1
Plot Repair

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with this text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially
      owned by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name
      Without Objection.

Create a Rule entitled "Adjacency" with this text:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.
      Two Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

      For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y)
      from 0 to 9:

        * If a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the
          Longitude for "Y") already exists, its Latitude and Longitude are set
to
          X and Y, respectively.
        * If no such Plot exists, then a Plot with that name, Latitude and
          Longitude is created.

Create a Rule entitled "The Cartographor" with this text:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures
          since the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the
          last Report

======================================================================
Proposal 3754 (Steve) AI = 1
Reinstate unemployment benefits

[Comment: the current VT supply situation for non-Officers is most unfair.
P3741 passed, repealing unemployment benefits, but being crippled by the
passage of P3740, no other source of VTs has replaced them, leaving non-
Officers with no reliable income at all. At least util we sort out what
we're going to do with Plots, we should reinstate unemployment benefits.
I've also used this opportunity to propose a minor tweak to R1670 (The
Distributor) to bring it under the control of LMP.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Unemployment Benefits", be
created with the following text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who did not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous week an unemployment benefit
      of half the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved that R1670 (The Distributor) be amended by 
replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, at the
      beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out one Voting Token to the
      Distributor, in recognition of eir service.

with text which reads:

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out to the
      Distributor Voting Tokens equivalent to the Basic Officer
      Salary, in recognition of eir service.
