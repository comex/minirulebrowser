I am pleased to announce three election results, all by acclamation,
due to only one Nomination being received.  (The Archivist and
Assessor nominating periods have been over for a couple of days, but
that for S-E has only just finished.)

As of this message, Steve is elected to the Office of Archivist and
Speaker-Elect, and General Chaos is elected to the Office of Assessor.
Their terms of office will expire on 1 May.

Michael.
