Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 08 Apr 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

This time, we have a whole bunch of new proposals, all made by New
Rishonnomic (not by me, though).

Voting in our referendum on these lasts for one week and is _free_, so
please do vote!


INP365 by New Rishonnomic
--------------------------

--Amend Rule 306 to read:

Whenever a proposal containing to transformation rule change is
accepted, the member nomic that proposed it shall gain two points.

Whenever such a proposal is accepted with no votes against and the
number of voting members voting for it is equal to or higher than the
number of voting members abstaining, the member nomic that proposed it
shall gain eight points instead of two.


INP 366 - New Rishonnomic
------------------------

--Transmute Rule 104 to Mutable.

--Amend Rule 104 to read:

"If a Rule 309 exists, its rulenumber shall change to 205.  If a Rule
311 exists, its rulenumber shall change to 210.  If neither a Rule 309
nor a Rule 311 exists, Rule 104 shall be repealed."

--Create a Rule with the text: 

"Whenever the rules refer to something happening publicly, this shall
mean it happens in a mail to the Internomic mailing list."


INP 367  by New Rishonnomic
---------------------------

--Transmute Rule 103 to Mutable.

--Amend Rule 103 to read: 

At any time, there shall be exactly one moderator, who must be a
player of at least one member nomic. The moderator may not resign. If
the moderator is no longer a player of any member nomic, e must
announce to Internomic that a successor has to be found. E may also do
so if e wants to give up this position.

If the rules do not state methods to automatically determine the
identity of the new moderator, the old moderator must publicly name a
successor who is a

player of at least one member nomic. If the chosen successor doesn't
publicly announce e accepts within 72 hours, the old moderator may
publicly name another successor instead of the formerly chosen
successor. If a chosen successor publicly announces e accepts, e
replaces the moderator.

If the rules state methods to automatically determine the identity of
the new moderator, and these methods return exactly one eligible
person, this person replaces the moderator. If the methods return at
least two eligible persons, the old moderator must publicly pick one
of them, which then replaces the old moderator.

Other rules may specify other ways to replace the moderator. The
moderator can only be replaced as specified in the rules.

--Transmute Rule 103 to Immutable

--Amend Rule 348 by removing the string "The moderator can only be
changed as specified in the rules."


INP 368 by New Rishonnomic
--------------------------

--Transmute Rule 105 to Mutable

--Amend Rule 105 by adding as the third sentence 

"The liaison of a nomic can only be changed by that nomic, and such a
change is not effective until this has been publicly announced."

--Transmute Rule 105 to Immutable

--Amend Rule 348 by removing the string 

"The liaison of a nomic can only be changed by that nomic, and such a
change is not effective until notice of it has been sent to the the
internomic mailing list."


INP 369 by New Rishonnomic
----------------------------------------

--Amend Rule 204 to read:
"Every proposal shall contain zero or more rule changes.

A proposal containing no rule changes is called a gamestate proposal.
A member nomic may only make such gamestate proposals that are
explicitly allowed by the rules."

--Amend Rule 209 by adding as a second sentence:
"In exception to this, rules may state that gamestate proposals also
pass if less than 80% but more than at least 50% of the votes cast on
the proposal are in favor."

--Amend Rule 335 by adding as a second paragraph:
"A member may make a gamestate proposal to change the Attitude
of Internomic to one or more member nomics. If this gamestate
proposal contains only Attitude changes to Neutral, it passes if more
than 50% of the votes cast on the proposal are in favor."
