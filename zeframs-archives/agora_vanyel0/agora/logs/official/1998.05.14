Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 14 May 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report

I still haven't seen a public announcement of the results of INP364
(not to mention INP365ff). Clearly, the moderator is not doing eir job
properly. However, it looks as though INP364 was rejected, with Agora
voting for it. I therefore issue a payment order for 1 VT from the
bank to myself according to rule 1748 (I made INP 364, although it was
submitted through New Rishonnomic).
