======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The following summarizes, I hope, the consensus reached in
discussions between Crito, Chuck and myself concerning the casting of
votes during the period of the infection of R1598. Any mistakes are
my own.

The infection of R1598 invalidated the Rule which defines Transfer
Orders. We accept that this had the effect of making impossible the
execution of any delayed implicit Transfer Orders such as would
ordinarily arise from messages sent to the Public Forum purporting to
be voting messages. Since both Rules 1442 and 206 state that the
casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of Voting
Tokens, it was initially thought that it would be impossible to cast
votes on any Proposals whose Voting Periods concluded during the
period of the infection of R1598. This initial view is reflected in
the Assessor's Report of the results for Proposals 3601-3613, in
which all the Proposals are listed as having failed, with no votes
cast either for or against them.

However, Crito has persuasively argued that this initial view is
mistaken. A closer look at R1442 shows that, despite the connotations
ordinarily attached to the word 'spend', the spending of Voting Tokens
for the purposes of R1442 does not require the execution of the
implicit delayed Transfer Orders which normally arise from voting
messages. It requires only the submission of such Transfer Orders,
and this is not blocked by the infection of R1598. R1442 states
that:

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal...

Since R1442 begins by stating that the casting of any votes may only
be achieved by the spending of VTs, and since the Rule also obviously
accepts that votes are cast when a voting message appears in the PF,
it follows that the submission of the implicit delayed TOs associated
with the votes in a voting message is sufficient, for the purposes
of R1442, for regarding VTs as having been spent. The execution of
those TOs is not necessary. Hence the infection of R1598 did not
prevent the casting of votes on Proposals 3601-3613.

======================================================================
Judge's reasoning and Arguments:

The central question of the Statement, once it is given that there were
unequivocally posts to the PF that alleged themselves to be player's
votes on the given proposals, is whether or not the infection of Rule
1598 prevented those votes from being, in the terms of Rule 206, Rule
683, Rule 1741 and others, "cast."

Looking at what the infection of Rule 1598 did to the Ruleset, it left
the Rules without an explicit definition of what a Transfer Order was,
and more importantly it left us without a definition of what it was to
submit or execute a Transfer Order.  While it might have been legal for
Recordkeepors to continue paying attention to attempted TOs without
these definitions, the fact is they did not do so, and that decision was
at least as legal as the alternative.  So it is a fact that no TOs were
successfully made or executed during the period of Rule 1598.

So the question is, can a Vote be cast without a successful Transfer
Order?  Can Votes be cast when TOs are prevented by the Rules?

Rule 1442 [Power 1] states;

     "The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending of
      VTs, as specified below. . ."

The term "spending" is a unique term, that I find only in this Rule, and
nowhere else in all the technical jargon of our Currency Rules.  If the
word was not used as it is, I would argue for the common-sense
definition of the term re Currencies, but the Rule does not allow this,
since it specifies, "as specified below."  The Rule defines its own
meaning for "spending a VT."

Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal."

>From the way this is worded, the only adequate definition for "spending
a VT" we can glean from this rule is the "implicit submission of a
delayed Transfer Order [...] for however many VTs."   If a player can
only cast a Vote by spending VTs, the above paragraph states how those
votes are cast (a message to the Assessor) and how the VTs are spent (an
implied delayed Transfer Order.)

This is further strengthened by the wording later on where;

Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal."

The fact that when a vote is "uncast", the TO goes away implies that the
 implied TO is the "spending" and _not_ the implied TO's execution.
This is important, since during the infection of 1598 we had no
mechanism for successfully executing TOs, that didn't mean that Votes
did not continue to create implied TOs.  What the infection did was make
"implied TO" a noun without context or effect, but not without
existence.  (Essentially rendering the 1442 the same as if all instances
of delayed Transfer Orders with the word Blorg.  We don't know what a
Blorg is, or what it does, but 1442 more or less equates creating a
Blorg with spending a VT, which is its requirement for casting a vote.)

----

Side Note: Rule 1730 is a strange bird which gives a stopgap
interpretation for Delayed Transfer Order.  It still fails to give a
procedure for executing a TO, so it doesn't really affect the above
interpretation.  But the first paragraph of 1730 is very strange;

1730 [Power 1]

     "If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

It seems that it's lucky that Recordkeepors could still reject orders
during the infection, otherwise they might have found themselves under
all sorts of uncomfortable obligations.  (Since IMO the capitalization
of the word Order doesn't deprive it of its natural meaning in absence
of a rule to the contrary.)

---

Back to Rule 1442 [cont.]

     "A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal."

Setting aside the timing issue (if the Assessor delays the execution of
TOs until a few hours after the end of the VP, the Rule implies they did
not count) this is the crux of 1442 impact on the given Statement.  This
is again because of the fact we have no executed TOs for the Proposals
in question.  However, the problem is twofold;

  i) Can 1442 prevent Votes from being "counted"?
     (in the terms of Rule 955)
 ii) Would this prevent those Votes from being cast?

Last question first.  Rule 1442 already defines what it is to "cast" a
vote, and it does not contradict that in the final paragraph.  According
to 1442, a Vote is cast by sending a message to the Assessor and can
only be "un-cast" by a cancellation of the Vote.  Whatever other rules
say about "casting Votes" or even "casting VTs" the answer of whether
1442 prevents casting Votes is fairly clear, it does not.

Now to the final question--
Does 1442 prevent Votes from being counted?

>From Rule 955 [Power 3]

     "When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor."

This trumps whatever 1442 would say to the contrary.  There has been
some argument that the final restriction of 1442 implies that such Votes
(without successfully executed TOs) are not "legally cast,"  but I think
it is a stretch to avoid this conflict in that manner.  1442 implies
nothing in its text about the legality of the casting of any Vote.  It
merely defines what casting a Vote is, and makes an attempt at a
restriction based on the results of that Vote (the implied TO).  It is
transparent in the wording that Votes are cast at the time they are
sent, and it is a strain to interpret the last paragraph of 1442 as
retroactively illegalizing the casting of votes when it says nothing
about the casting of those Votes, but only about TOs and counting Votes.

It is this Judge's opinion that 1442 states that Votes are [legally]
cast when the Voting Entity sends a message to the Assessor.  It is also
the Judge's opinion that, due to the precedence of Rule 955, these Votes
are to be counted by the Assessor regardless of the success or failure
of any related Transfer Orders.  I hereby Judge the Statement True.


=========================
Evidence:

Rule 955/3 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.  The
      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

Rule 1442/11 (Power=1)
Using VTs

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

Rule 1730/0 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Proposal 3555, which enacted 'A Public Voting Experiment', passed on
Oct. 24, 1997. Rulekeepor Chuck subsequently assigned it, or at least
attempted to assign it, the number 1741. This attempt, however, could
not have been successful. The number 1741 was not, as it is required
to be by R1349, the "least integer greater than all other Numbers
previously given to a Rule", for that number had previously been
assigned to the Rule 'Restore Game balance II', enacted by Proposal
3538. It is true that at the time Chuck assigned the number 1741 to
'A Public Voting Experiment', he did not then believe that P3538 had
passed. However, there had been an earlier time during which he had
believed that P3538 had passed, and during that time, he did assign
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II'. Although he later came
to believe that P3538 failed and that therefore his assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore game Balance II' had been incorrect,
subsequent events have shown that this initial estimation was the
correct one: P3538 did pass after all, and so Chuck's assignment of
the Number 1741 to 'Restore Game Balance II' was the assignment of a
Rule Number to a Rule. That Number was therefore not available to be
assigned to 'A Public Voting Experiment'. That Rule, as the Statement
alleges, has not yet been given a Number by the Rulekeepor.

Note that this argument does not rely on interpreting the controversial
clause "...including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
have been incorrectly enacted" in R1349 in any particular way. Given
that P3538 actually did pass after all, 'Restore Game Balance II' was
correctly enacted and so this provision was not triggered.


======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I am in essential agreement with the Caller's arguments.

I wish to note, in addition, that this kind of confusion could
easily be avoided by a simple legislative remedy, consisting of
amending the 'pragmatic' provision of Rule 1349 - i.e. "The Number of
a Rule shall be the least integer greater than all other Numbers
previously given to a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later
determined to have been incorrectly enacted)" - to clearly refer to
incorrect *assignments* of a Rule Number rather than to the
incorrect *enactment* of a Rule, which is at present without
meaning.

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R1023 contains the following provision:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

The 'ordering requirement' referred to is, of course, that of the
ASAP Rule. But this is irrelevant to the Statement. The provision,
I claim, has two distinct effects: it excludes discussionary activity
from the ASAP ordering requirement (a curious provision, since no-one
has ever been required to discuss anything), and it enforces the
permissibility of discussion at any time. These two effects are quite
independent of each other. So, for the purposes of judging the CFJ,
I would say that the relevant part of R1023 reads:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature...may be conducted at
      any time.

As far as I know, this provision has never had any effect before. On
the other hand, no Rule has ever sought to prohibit discussion before.
Before, that is, R1729, which states, concerning Insane Proposals, that:

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been bended.

Leaving aside the question of whether there is an important distinction
between breaking the Rules and bending them, this Rule clearly seeks to
make some kinds of discussion illegal. This brings it into conflict with
R1023, a conflict which it loses, illustrating in a particular case,
the general truth of the Statement.

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I judge TRUE.

I agree with the Caller that the second part of the cited sentence must be
considered on its own behalf.

I also do not find anything else in Rule 1023 that contradicts this.
There are deferrence clauses, but those would merely reduce the Rule's
precedence and so are not of concern to the Statement.

(I do not think they trigger in the case of Rule 1729, anyhow.)

Still, I deny the requested Injunction.  This I do because Rule 1729,
while the immediate reason for the interest in this issue, is not actually
relevant to its resolution.  The statement would be just as true if 1729
did not exist.


Rule 1023/9 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      the Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

=======================================================================
Changes Since Last Report
======================================================================

Proposal 3633 (Chuck): 1
  As a general policy, I will not award style (positive or negative)
  for a straightforward excision of concepts unless the excision is
  handled unusually well (or badly) or with particular flair (or lack
  thereof).  Since Chuck remembered to amend Rule 1681, he gets one
  Style Point for not accidentially dangling a concept.

Proposal 3634 (Steve): 0
  No comment.

Proposal 3635 (General Chaos): 0 [Wizard's Proposal]

Proposal 3636 (General Chaos): 0 [Wizard's Proposal]

Proposal 3637 (Blob): -1
  Rule text is not formatted to standard conventions.  I also think
  the power to declare Perpetuity should reside in the Speaker, not
  the Registrar.

Proposal 3638 (Michael): 0
  Clean but uncomplicated excision.

Proposal 3639 (Harlequin): +2
  The idea of manually infecting a Rule is hilarious.

Proposal 3640 (Harlequin): 0
  This Proposal is its own reward.

Proposal 3641 (Kolja A.): -1
  Failure to capitalize "Promotor" and "Rule".

Proposal 3642 (General Chaos): 0 [Wizard's Proposal]

Proposal 3643 (General Chaos): 0 [Wizard's Proposal]

Proposal 3644 (General Chaos): 0 [Wizard's Proposal]

Proposal 3645 (elJefe): -2
  Doesn't work.  elJefe failed to amend out the provision of Rule 408
  that make a late Judge ineligible to submit a Judgement.

Proposal 3646 (elJefe): 0
  No comment.

Proposal 3647 (Swann): -2
  In general, stating that a thing is permitted is redundant with Rule
  116, and the Wizard strongly disapproves of this construction when
  redundant.  There are a number of similarly sloppy constructions in
  this Proposed Rule, as well as at least one phrase which is
  potentially ambigious on a first reading.  Not the worst Proposal
  this Wizard has seen, but it's up there.

Proposal 3648 (Swann): -1
  "The Speaker has the power to..."  What does this mean?  Further,
  the Proposed Rule fails to specify how the Speaker is to designate
  such a Proposal, creating an information shortfall for the Assessor.

Proposal 3649 (Swann): -1
  "integral value that is positive, negative, or zero" is redundant,
  and the Proposal contains several grammatical errors (including a
  nasty comma splice in the first paragraph).

======================================================================

Events of Note:

As of this message, Blob, elJefe, and Swann all become Boors.
Registrar, do so note.

Certain REMARKS have come phorth that my POETRY has not based on an
AUTHENTIC sources (I could find not such on the NET.  I blame the
TOLKIEN ESTATE and its intolerant COPYRIGHT POLICIES.) My POETRON
works hard but is NOT able to find a suitable rhyme for "Lab" YET.
AnyHOW.


There be 12 DELETABLE sentences in the Frankenstein Rule.

The first number is 558, giving 5 as our MOD 4, and the second number
is 13467, giving 1 as our MOD 3.  SENTENCE 1 is selected:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
      Frankenstein Monster.

The second sentence is chosen AMONG sentences 2-12.  The number is
16145, giving 61 = 6 (mod 11), or sentence number SEVEN:

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

Per my POLICY, sentence _1_ is chosen to be deleted.


We must AGAIN select a Rule.  The Rulekeepor has selected number 1749
for the "Public Voting experiment", which means the PRELIMINARY number
for "Read the Ruleset Week" has been taken.  So will the latter Rule
be temporarily assigned number 0.

555, 871, 1271, 1442.

Rule 1442/11 (Power=1)
Using VTs

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.


The Mad Scientist WISHES it recorded that the TEMPTATION to break Policy
is currently immense.

However, I see POTENTIAL in expanding upon the procedures in sentence 1-2
of the Frankenstein Rule.  I select the sentence:

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.

I select the noun "Proposal".

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Frankenstein Monster when e, during 
      the Voting Period of that Frankenstein Monster, informs the
      Assessor of the Vote (or Votes) e is casting upon that
      Frankenstein Monster.

The above sentence is inserted as paragraph 3 of the Frankenstein Rule,
which now READS:

Rule 1671/100 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Frankenstein Monster when e, during
      the Voting Period of that Frankenstein Monster, informs the
      Assessor of the Vote (or Votes) e is casting upon that
      Frankenstein Monster.

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Frankenstein
      Monsters, make Frankenstein Monsters, or hold Office, and cannot
      be required by the Rules to perform any duty or action, unless
      that Rule specifically states that it can require On Hold
      Players to perform actions.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in 
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the
      Frankenstein Monster's report of an infraction from having legal
      effect.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.


The Frankenstein Rule has reached Amendment Number 100!  I expect WILD
CELEBRATIONS, especially in Niger.

HIP HIP HOORAY,
ØRJAN.

                               CFJ 1074

 "A Proposer of a Disinterested Proposal is not liable for a 1 P-note
  fee if their proposal fails."

======================================================================

Judge:       elJefe
Judgement:   DISMISS

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin,

Caller:      Michael

History:

  Called by Michael, 10 Dec 1997 08:44:05 +0000
  Assigned to elJefe, 10 Dec 1997 21:59:41 +0000
  Dismissed, 17 Dec 1997 13:41:00 +0000


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The relevant sentence is in R833/9: "If the Sponsor and the Proposer
of a Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note."

The Sponsor is earlier defined in the same rule as "The entity which
paid the Petition fee for a given Proposal".  By definition, a
Disinterested Proposal does not have a Sponsor, so the first sentence
quoted is best interpreted as having no meaning; just as sentences
involving the "King of France in 1997" are meaningless.

Without that sentence, there is no requirement for the Proposer of a
Disinterested Proposal to be billed.

Michael.

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I would like to judge this TRUE.  The facts and Rules are as noted by the
Caller, in particular the crucial sentence of Rule 833, "If the Sponsor and
the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the
Assessor shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note."  Any meaning that it has
clearly presupposes that the Sponsor and the Proposer are entities.  Since
the Sponsor does not exist (for a Disinterested proposal), the antecedent
is False by virtue of depending on a false assumption, and so the
consequent does not take effect.

The trouble is that the statement is phrased too broadly.  Another Rule
seeks to impose a 1 P-note fee on a Proposer in certain situations, namely
Rule 1451 for disowning a Proposal.  Judging TRUE would bind us to an
interpretation in which this fee cannot be imposed either, and that would
be wrong.  On the other hand, judging FALSE is also inappropriate.

The best way to treat such incomplete hypotheticals as the Statement, is to
hold them unjudgeable as not containing sufficient information.  In this
case, there is no way to discover whether or not the hypothetical failed
Disinterested Proposal was disowned, and thus no way to find sufficient
information to judge true or false.  Therefore I dismiss the CFJ under Rule
1565(vi).
