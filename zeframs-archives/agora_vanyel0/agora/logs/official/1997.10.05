Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Sun, 5 October 1997

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 10 and 11, which read:


      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Frankenstein Monster shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer
      of that Proposal.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.


I selected sentence 10 to be deleted.


STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1697, which reads:

####
Rule 1697/0 (Power=1)
Multiple rapid wins prohibited

      Any Player who has Won twice within a given seven day period is
      prohibited from Winning again during that period.  This is a
      Win-Preventing condition for that Player.
####

I selected the sentence

      This is a Win-Preventing condition for that Player.

I selected the noun "condition."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      This is a Win-Preventing Frankenstein Monster for that Player.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/45 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      This is a Win-Preventing Frankenstein Monster for that Player.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
