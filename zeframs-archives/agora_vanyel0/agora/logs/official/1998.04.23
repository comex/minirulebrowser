Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3731 (Steve) AI = 1
Variable Batch Sizes

[Comment: fixed the bug spotted by Murphy (I think?), and decided
after all to force the Promotor to give a bit of warning -4 days,
in fact. Note that "midnight GMT Thursday" is assumed to mean
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, in line with the customary 
interpretation of R459.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

======================================================================
Proposal 3733 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Vacated blots and scores

Amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The Herald must order this Score change.

======================================================================
Proposal 3734 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No PI for players on hold

Amend 1713 by replacing the second sentence with the following text:

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a 
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order 
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.
