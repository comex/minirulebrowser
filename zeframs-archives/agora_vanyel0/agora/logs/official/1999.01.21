Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3823 (Oerjan) AI = 2
Spring Cleaning
   
[Corrections of various errors found during Read the Ruleset Week, and
a few found while preparing this Proto.
   
I have not included capitalization in this, although it is a mess.
That may be a separate Proto.

I also did not try to standardize between "a SLC" and "an SLC".
I _did_ include corrections of "he/his" to "e/eir".

I have divided the Proto into "Basic grammar and spelling", which
should be fairly uncontroversial changes, and "Various", which may or
may not be so.

I'll check what AI this needs at a later stage.

2: Many changes, mostly removing provisions that have become
unnecessary due to other Proposals.  For a while I kept track of newly
introduced errors as well, but I have mostly given up on this - I did
find one by chance during the latest check.  The Proto title is no
longer fitting, alas, but maybe I can get this proposed before it
becomes so again.

3: Final cleanup.]

Part 2: Various


Amend Rule 1023 ('Definition of "As Soon As Possible"') by replacing

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

           duties.

[I find the current formulation illogical.
2: Steve found my reformulation illogical.  Let's see if removing the
indices helps.]

[2: Rule 1645 was disinfected.  Provision removed.]
      
[2: Rule 1659 was amended by the Electee reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1626 ("Applications") by replacing the paragraph reading

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.
      
with
      
      If a Player Executing an Application claims that the Application
      contains certain Signatures, but the purported Signatures have
      not been added to it in a manner consistent with this Rule, e
      commits the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

[The rest of the Rule defines Signatures Platonically, in such a way
that an Application cannot contain illegal ones.]
           
Amend Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges") by replacing the paragraph
reading
           
      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

with

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of   
      Judicial Delinquency, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts
      and bearing a penalty of 2 Blots.

[The original Rule only requires the penalty to be reported, not the
Infraction.]

If the last and second last paragraphs of Rule 1575 ("Standards of
Proof") are identical, delete the last paragraph.  
      
[They certainly look identical to me...]

[2: Rules 663 and 1564 were repealed and amended, respectively, by the
Omnibus Reform.  Provisions removed.]

[2: Rule 1713 was amended by the Omnibus Reform.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1637 ("Wills") by replacing "treasury" with "entity".

[Old terminology.]
           
Amend Rule 1662 ("The Speaker's Gratuity") by replacing "At the end of
every month" with "After the end of every month".
      
[The current formulation could be taken to imply that the Registrar
has to pay out at an exact moment.  While there is game custom to the
contrary, this is still not a good formulation.]
      
[2: Rule 1682 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

Amend Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") by removing the text ", or which would
allow em to reregister".

[The Pardoning system does not work due to this.  It doesn't help
having a precedence clause when the lowered-numbered Rule you are 
trying to trump also has one...]
      
Amend Rule 1747 ("Pardoning Lawlessness") to read

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon   
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing e is doing so in the Public Forum. Then the following
      events shall occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned  
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period e must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to eir debt and may not transfer them to  
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.
      
["He/his" and some bad timing requirements have been changed.
2: Steve had some comments on the substance of this Rule, however, I 
believe that is beyond the scope of this Proposal, so no change due to
this.]
      
Amend Rule 1439 ("Blots Due to a CFJ") by replacing the text

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of   
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for   
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

with
           
      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall make the
      Payment Orders necessary to apply the Blots.
      
      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall vacate the Blots that were given due to
      the initial Judgement of the CFJ.
      
[Fixes a missing period and makes the Rule PC compliant.]   

Amend Rule 1658 ("Tainting the Speaker") by replacing "permitted to   
call such a Referendum" with "authorized to call such a Referendum".  

[With all the Rule 116/1011 debates I don't feel that the word   
"permitted" has enough weight for this purpose.]

[2: Rule 681 was amended.  Provision removed.]
      
Amend Rule 1590 ("Maintainer of SLCs") and Rule 1531 ("Administrators
and Their Duties") by replacing each instance of "Compact" with "SLC".

[Old terminology.]

[2: Rule 1651 was repealed.  Provision removed.]

                               CFJ 1112

  In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and elsewhere, it
  is not sufficient that a collection of text "with the clear indication
  that that text is intended to become a Proposal" (R1483) merely be
  sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the collection of text
  must also be received in the Public Forum.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The truth of the Statement almost, but not quite, follows directly from
R1483, which states that:

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

But R1483 only talks about Proposal *creation*, not about Proposal
*submission*. Nevertheless, armed with the distinction in R1483 between
collections of text on the one hand, and Proposals on the other, it is
only a short step to the truth of the Statement. One need only consider
the absurd consequences of denying the truth of the Statement. If we
denied it, and held instead that merely sending a collection of text to
the PF is sufficient for submitting a Proposal, then in a case like the
one which inspired this CFJ, in which Morendil provably has sent to the
Public Forum a collection of text intended to become a Proposal, but
which equally provably did not reach the Public Forum, we should have to
say that although Morendil submitted a Proposal, there is no Proposal
which Morendil submitted, since a Proposal is only created when the text
is delivered to the PF. That seems to me to be an untenable view.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

After deliberating the meaning of "received in the Public Forum", I
have come to the conclusion that this term, while it can be
interpreted either when considering the PF (R478) as a medium (or
approximately, channel), or also when considering the Public Forum as
an abstract public space (presumably containing the Players), requires
an implicit recipient or recipients different from the Public Forum
itself.

While delivery to the Public Forum implies receipt _by_ the Public
Forum, it is not therefore clear that it implies receipt _in_ the
Public Forum.  I think this rests exactly upon the dichotomy between
medium/channel (which would, in our current situation, consist mainly
of the mailing list and its software, possibly including the list
administrator) and public space (which would include the Players,
except those with temporary connection problems).

Which should be used in the current situation?  I believe that the
latter would be in the best interest of the game, as it allows us to
liberate the Public Forum from technical issues and to consider a
message to be received only when it has been received by people, which
gives accountability.

However, it remains to argue that this is consistent with the
definition provided of Public Forum in Rule 478.  The way the Rule is
written, I interpret it as taking a medium/channel and vesting upon it
the property of also being a public space.  This does, I believe,
require that we consider the word "Public Forum" to be more than an
arbitrary name tag and to imply that the entities described in Rule
478 do become fora, in the common language sense.  I think this is an
admissible interpretation.

Given this, I conclude that receipt by and receipt in the Public Forum
are equivalent.  I further agree with the remainder of the argument 
provided by the Caller, and find the statement TRUE.

==========================================================================
Evidence attached by the Judge:

Rule 478/9 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      annoucing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.) 

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum. 

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules calls upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise

(The current version is probably a nearly identical 478/10, amended by
Spring Cleaning.)
