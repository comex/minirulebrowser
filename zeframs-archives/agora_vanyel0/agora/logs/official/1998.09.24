Repeal-O-Matic Rule selection for Sep 24 1998
---------------------------------------------

There are 335 rules in the latest short logical ruleset.
Selecting five at random gives:

 33 : Rule 104  (First Speaker)
146 : Rule 889  (Clerk of the Courts)
144 : Rule 1810 (Noncompliance with Orders)
141 : Rule 1802 (Vacation of Orders)
 95 : Rule 106  (Amendment Numbers)

This is a rather uninspiring batch. I'll choose R104, for 
no good reason, and make the following proposal, on behalf
of the Repeal-O-Matic:

PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule 104 (First Speaker)
      This Proposal shall have an AI = 3
      Rule 104 is hereby Repealed.

A Duty to Vote

[Comment: a second try at this. Crito said he would have voted for it
if it hadn't been for the Blot penalty, so I've taken the Blot penalty
out. I've also added some other extraneous stuff at the end, including
the repeal of R1625 that 'Permanent Electioneering' was supposed to have
accompished.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Vote", be enacted
with the following text:

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three Voting
      Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed, who is not
      denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active at the end of
      the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch whose Voting Period
      finishes latest, and who fails to cast a vote on any Proposal in
      the batch, commits the Infraction of Failing to Vote, to be
      detected and reported by the Assessor. The penalty for commission
      of this Infraction is 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1016 (Putting Oneself on Hold) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last went On Hold.

with text which reads:

      E may not do so until at least a week after e last went On Hold.

Be it further resolved that R1838 (Tabula Rasa) be repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1744 (Danger! Danger Will Robinson!) be
repealed.

Be it further resolved that R1625 (Secrecy of Votes) be repealed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  Steve (AI = 1)
Tweak the Taxation Rules

[Comment: a second try (the first failed Quorum while declaring Presence
was banned) at two minor fixes to the taxation Rules. The first changes
the definition of 'in circulation' to exclude Currency already owed to
the Bank (this fixes the bug which would otherwise require the Accountor
to Levy Taxes again immediately after e has just done so, but before any
taxes have been paid). The second lifts the requirement that the
taxation POs actually be made in the same message as the taxation
announcement, and removes the silly requirement that the Accountor tax
the Bank. As a bonus, I include the repeal of R1542 (Style Points),
which was supposed to have been repealed with the passage of 'Get Rid of
4 Offices'.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1852 (Circulation of Voting Tokens) be
amended by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank. 

with text which reads:

      The amount of a Currency in circulation is the amount of that
      Currency possessed by entities other than the Bank, minus the 
      total of the undisputed Payment Orders for that Currency naming
      entities other than Bank as payor, and the Bank as payee.

Be it further resolved that R1853 (Levying Taxes) be amended by replacing
in it the text which currently reads:

      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy.

with text which reads:

      As soon as possible after making the announcement, the
      Accountor is required to execute Payment Orders naming each
      entity other than the Bank in possession of the named Currency
      as payor, and with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the
      named Currency equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1542 (Style Points) be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[Comment: it's hard to believe we haven't already done this.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1808 (Administrative and Private Orders)
be amended by deleting from it the word "directly".

Repeal Rule 104 (First Speaker)

      Rule 104 is hereby Repealed.
