                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

Vlad

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

Decision of the Justiciar: SUSTAIN the judgement of FALSE

For trivial reasons.  The date in the statement is wrong for the caller's
argument to work, and there is no other reason for thinking the statement
true.

This is a factual error, not a spelling (etc.) error, nor the use of a
synonym or abbreviation, so I can't use Rule 754 to Judge the statement
that was probably intended.

The caller states:

>However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
>statement, contained the sentence

>      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster

>      or implicitly permits it.

This sentence was reported on 6 September 1997, _not_ at the time specified
in the Statement.

The only sentence addition reported on Mon, 11 August 1997, was:

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.


There is no reason to think that this addition made changes impossible.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

It is the opinion of the Speaker that the Judgement in CFJ 941 should
be OVERTURNED, that the original Judgement be VACATED, and the
original CFJ DISMISSED.

The Statement of CFJ 941 refers to the "change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to 'Week 1', reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11
August 1997".  This entity does not exist; nothing in the Report of
the Mad Scientist posted on 11 August 1997 assigned anything to 'Week
1', as my fellow Justice elJefe has noted. 

There are two schools of reasoning regarding the truth values of
statements which contain definite descriptions of entities which do
not exist; one school holds that all such statements are categorically
FALSE, while the other holds that such statements are not well-formed
and thus have no truth value.  I am of the latter school.  I find that
the Statement of CFJ 941 "can not logically admit to either being TRUE
or FALSE", and therefore this CFJ should properly have been dismissed
under Rule 1565(ii).

Respectfully submitted,

General Chaos
Speaker, Agora Nomic

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

As my fellow Justice elJefe already noted, the change claimed to make
future Amendments impossible, was not reported on 11 August, although
some other, much less dangerous change was. However, there is something
more to discuss. As can be seen from the actual 11 August report,
there is no ''change to the Frankenstein Monster assigned to "Week 1", 
reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon, 11 August 1997,'' and thus also
no time when it took effect.

To General Chaos this has let to a dismissal, as the truth of a statement
about a non-existing object cannot be decided, and even has no logical
meaning. However, I would not go that far. In my opinion some statements
can and other can't be decided. "The pink unicorn has 678 legs" is
undecidable, but "The pink unicorn has made me pregnant" is false. Maybe
it has to do with its effects on reality. But what about "All proposed 
Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible by the 
Frankenstein Generator when the pink unicorn was born"? It's a close call,
but to me it is false. And so I judge.

Normally it's my opinion that in case the decisive points are points that
neither the Judge nor the Appellants (how is that spelled?) have mentioned,
the Court of Appeals should ask for rejudgement, but in this case it is
clear that either FALSE or Dismissal is right, and their difference is of
no importance.

Thus, I call for SUSTAINing the Judgement of FALSE.
