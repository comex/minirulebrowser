Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 28 Dec 1997

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


1. IN voting results:

INP 353 rejected
   Yes: Ackanomic
   No: Agora, [New Rishonomic and Internomic if New Rishonomic can vote]

INP 354 rejected
   No: Ackanomic, Agora, [New Rishonomic and Internomic if New 
       Rishonomic can vote]


INP 355 (the 'Play Nomic' proposal), was rejected.

Against: Ackanomic, Agora, Internonic [and New Rishonomic assuming
it is a voting member].


2. SFJ 9: The statement for judgement,
     "New Rishonnomic (with 2 n's) is not a voting member of
      Internomic."

was judge TRUE. The Pumpkin Patch made a big effort to deliver a well
reasoned judgement, and this is certainly worth reading even for those
not interested in IN or the New Rishon'n'omic affair. Ask me for a
copy if you didn't get one.

Friendliness Report:

Friendly: Agora, FRC, InterNomic
Hostile:  none
