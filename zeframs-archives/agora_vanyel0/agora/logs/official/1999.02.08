H. Registrar Andre: please note that Steve and Blob have been awarded
the Patent Title of Zeitgeist for the unanimous passage of P3829 and

Failure to Vote
======================================================================
The following Players were deemed to have a Duty to Vote on these 
Proposals: Crito, Kolja, Vlad.

Of these, the following are guilty of Failure to Vote: Kolja
Appropriate POs are issued below.

Note: I realise that Kolja's Duty to Vote is open to debate. E had
3.5 VTs at the beginning of the Voting Period, but he had already
voted on the previous batch of proposals, which meant that a debt
of 1.2 VTs was imminent, but had not yet been issued. In my opinion,
this means that he did have "effective control" of more than 3 VTs,
so he had a Duty to Vote. I raised this with Kolja, and he was keen
to see the matter debated, and go to the courts if necessary, with 
Steve as his advocate. 
======================================================================
Payment Orders

The following Payment Orders are issued, each for the reason specified:

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3829 (Steve) AI = 3
Clearing the Ground
     
[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
may not deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any
      other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.


Be it further resolved that R113 (Players may always opt out) be amended
by replacing the phrase "A Player" with the phrase "A Player other than
the Speaker".
      
[Since the Proposal has an AI of 3 anyway, I've taken the opportunity to
iron out some of the wrinkles in the Rules about the Speaker and   
deregistration. At present, the wise policy of preventing the Speaker
from deregistering is enforced indirectly by R103, and only then because
that Rule takes precedence over R113 in case of a conflict, which there
would be if the Speaker ever tried to claim eir right to deregister   
under R113.]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:
     
      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read: 

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message, 
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.
      
[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be  
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3830 (Blob) AI = 1
Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to   
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must  
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then  
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:
      
      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;
      
      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

                               CFJ 1118

  General Chaos' message to agora-business, dated Thu Feb 4 04:47:07 1999,
  with message-id < 199902041242.HAA2542-@poverty.bloomington.in.us >,
  initiated a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre.

History:

  Called by Steve:                         Mon, 08 Feb 1999 20:21:17 +1100
  Assigned to Vlad:                        as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

As is usual, I begin with the facts. The full text of the General's
message, which was sent to the Public Forum, is as follows. Replying to
a message from Andre, he wrote (text delimited by triple hyphens):

---
"Andre" == Andre Engels < engel-@win.tue.nl > writes:

Andre> I hereby again set the BOS to zero Voting Tokens.

Anybody who thinks I'm going to work for free while the Duty to Vote
exist is daft.

I hereby call for the Impeachment of Chancellor Andre.
---

Now, the Rules. Rule 1486 (Procedure to Impeach an Officer) states in
part that:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to Impeach an
      Officer at any time, by requesting such in the Public Forum... The
      Referendum must list both the Office and the current Electee to
      that Office by name.

General Chaos insists that because he did not use the word 'Referendum'
in his message, for example by saying "I hereby call for a Referendum to
Impeach Chancellor Andre", that his message did not succeed in
initiating a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre. I disagree. I hold
the contrary view that in the context (i.e., the existence of R1486),
specific use of the word 'Referendum' was not necessary to initiate a
Referendum to Impeach, and that a reasonable person would interpret his
message as a call for a Referendum to Impeach Chancellor Andre. To
insist that the use of the word "Referendum" is necessary to initiate a
Referendum is to insist on an absolutely strict adherence to rigidly
defined forms of words that is not in the best interests of the game. If
allowed to stand, this ultra-finicky legalism will set a dangerous
precedent. It might, to give just one example, allow the Assessor to
discount a message of the form "6666: FOR" (following the distribution
of Proposal 6666) as a vote for Proposal 6666, on the grounds that
neither the words 'vote' nor 'Proposal' appear in the message. I ask the
Judge to reject such insults to commonsense and deliver a Judgement of
TRUE.

I didn't bar Andre in this CFJ.  I believe the previous CFJ was when
this occurred.  My CFJ was meant to highlight the problem, but I
didn't end up barring anyone.

Michael.

Andre was barred by Crito in this CFJ, not by Michael in the next one.

==========================================================================
                               CFJ 1116

  The VT Payment Order labeled "RVTPO 822" in message "Message-Id:
  <199902031535.QAA07830@wsinfm15.win.tue.nl> Subject: OFF: Officer
  Salaries" (salary paid to Justiciar Crito) was improperly executed.

==========================================================================

Called by:           Crito

Judge:               Murphy
Judgement:           

Judge selection:

Eligible:            Chuck, elJefe, Kolja. A, Morendil, Murphy, Peekee, 
                     Steve, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:              Crito
Barred:              Andre
Had their turn:      Ørjan, Macross, Blob, General Chaos
Already served:      -
Defaulted:           -
By request:          -
On Hold:             Ørjan, lee

History:

  Called by Crito:                         Thu, 04 Feb 1999 13:38:42 -0500
  Assigned to Murphy:                      Fri, 05 Feb 1999 23:04:48 +1100

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R910 states "The Justiciar does not receive a fixed weekly salary."
R1007 states "Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an Office
              shall be equal to the Basic Salary."

I contend that the above statement in R910 constitutes a specification
of the salary for the Justiciar.  Because the (lack of) salary is
specified in R910, the above statement in R1007 prevents it from setting
the salary of the Justiciar to the Basic Salary.  I should remind the
Judge that if e were to find this CFJ TRUE, e must then vacate the
referenced Payment Order.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

This possibility is not prohibited by R897, and so, by our general
principle of the permissibility of the unprohibited (R116), is
permitted.  The Judge may wish to expand on the effect that a barring
might have if specified after a Judge selection was made.  I think
precedent (specifically, the decision that Players can not make
themselves ineligible for CFJs not yet called), makes it clear that
one couldn't bar possible judges before actually making a CFJ.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments

I judge the Statement of CFJ 1117 to be TRUE.

Argument:

I believe the Callers Arguments are correct.

R897 does not specify how or when, a Caller may bar players from judging
a CFJ.  So I believe R116 holds for this case.  Provided that it is
clear which CFJ  the players are barred from, and the person barring
them is the Caller.  (These conditions are obvious from the rules.)  The
time at which the Caller bars them is irrelevant.   Hence, I have to
conclude that the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.


My Opinions:        (As requested from the Callers Argument)

Considering R1860, 

Rule 1868/0 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This selection
      shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible to serve
      as the Judge of that CFJ.

>From my reading of this rule I conclude that if the Clerk of the Court
has not assigned a player to be a judge for a given CFJ.  Then the
caller is still open to bar players, if this is before OR after they
have posted their CFJ.  Provided that there is a clear indication of
which CFJ the Caller is referring to.  This would be most likely done by
number after the CFJ has been called, but could also be achieved by
quoting the statement.

The Caller in my opinion should be allowed to bar players after the
Clerk of the Court has assigned a judge.  This would not change the
judge at that time, but if the judge was then to change, (E.g. the judge
ceases to be a Player.) then the players which the Caller has barred,
would still be barred.

Also I believe that this is entirely different from Players making
themselves ineligible to serve, and so no precedents are broken.  If the
Caller knows who might be biased, then he should be able to bar them.
Also this knowledge could become known to the Caller before or after he
makes the CFJ. I assume CFJ1101 was to prevent blanket ineligibilities.
E.g. declaring yourself in eligible to judge on CFJs 1100 to 2000.  The
Caller could bar players in the same manner only if he was sure he was
going to be the Caller of CFJs 1100 to 2000.  As this is very unlikely I
believe my reading of the rules is in the best interests and the spirit
of Agora.
