                               CFJ 1081

  "Harlequin did not win the Game upon the conclusion of the voting
   period of Proposal 3640."


======================================================================

Judge:       Time Agent
Judgement:

Eligible:    Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Jester, Kolja A., Michael,
             Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Chuck
Barred:      Harlequin, Steve
On request:
On hold:


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Chuck, 22 Jan 1998 17:41:53 -0600
  Assigned to Time Agent, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Harlequin alleges that he did win the Game at that time, due
to Rule 1729.  I present two separate arguments why e did
not (the second applies only if the Judge rejects the first
argument).

I. Rule 1729 states, in part,

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

In CFJ 1078, Judge Blob ruled that Morendil *did* vote on P3640,
and thus was guilty of the violation of R1729, despite the fact
that the votes were later retracted.  Thus, in accordance with
CFJ 1078, Morendil did vote FOR it (e voted once FOR and once
AGAINST), and thus Harlequin did not win.

It has been suggested that "vote" can have more than one meaning
in the Rules, depending on context.  I will grant that the meaning
of "vote" differs depending on whether it is a noun or a verb, and
if the object of the vote is an Agora Proposal, Referendum, or Internomic
Proposal.  *However*, I find no use of the word "vote" as a verb
in reference to Agora Proposals in the Ruleset which would support
any interpretation other than that in the Judgement of CFJ 1078.

II. If the Judge rejects my argument above, I contend that Harlequin
still did not win, in that the reason that no one voted on P3640
was because it was against the Rules, and not "due to greed or sin"
as spelled out in R1729.

It has been objected that, as "due to greed or sin" is in parentheses,
it is meant only as an example, and not limiting on the wins which
might otherwise be permitted by R1729.  IMO, without a "for example,"
or "e.g.," in the parenthetical phrase, the most natural reading of
it is synonymous with an equivalent non-parenthetical phrase.

It has also been objected that not voting because it was against
the Rules is also due to greed, i.e., a desire to avoid the
penalty associated with breaking a Rule.  This is an overbroad
and non-standard interpretation of the word "greed."  For example,
my prime motivation in not speeding on the freeway may be a desire
to avoid the monetary penalty which may be involved, but this would
not be called greed.

>      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:

>On Thu, 18 Dec 1997 10:55:40 +0100, Morendil sent a message to the

>13:57:25 +0100, and also sent to the Public Forum, Morendil
>subsequently retracted these votes (see the Evidence attached for
>both messages).
>
>There are a number of points I think it worth bringing to the attention

>in force at the time, stated that:
>
>      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
>      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or
>      Referenda, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
>      Public Forum.
>
>Was there a conflict between Rules 1729 and 1749, a conflict which
>R1749 would have won in virtue of its precedence claim? I argue that
>there was no conflict. R1749 made it impossible to vote without
>sending a message to the PF; R1729 merely makes it illegal to vote by
>sending a message to the PF. The result is clear and achieved without
>conflict between the Rules: no Player could legally vote on P3640. A
>Player could, however, vote illegally on P3640 by sending a message
>to the PF, violating the stricture in R1729 that Players shall not
>vote in public on Insane Proposals. This is what I argue Morendil did.
>
>Secondly, we can quickly dismiss the matter of R1729's use of the
>word 'bended'. Although it is an interesting question whether there
>is a distinction recognized by Agoran law between breaking the rules
>and merely bending them, that question is not relevant here. The
>'bending' of R1729 arises in reference to the *discussion* of votes
>on Insane Proposals, not the act of voting itself. As far as that
>act is concerned, R1729 is crystal clear in prohibiting public
>voting on Insane Proposals, when it says "Nor shall a Player vote
>in public, only to Assessor. / The Votes shall be unknown to others,
>even employer and professor."
>
>Finally, there is the question of Morendil's retraction of his
>votes. Does this save him from having violated R1729? I do not
>think so. I argue that the Rules can distinguish between a case in
>which a Player first votes and then retracts his vote, and a case
>in which a Player does not vote at all. The fact that Morendil
>subsequently retracted his vote does not make it any less true that
>he had earlier voted, in violation of R1729.
>
>
>======================================================================
>Judge's Arguments:
>
>I concur with the Steve's argument in calling this judgement. Morendil
>has clearly violated rule 1729. I have little to add to the points
>Steve has already made.
>
>I will say that if, when a player retracts eir vote, e really has not
>voted at all, then this makes for a very complicated interpretation of

    "Chuck incorrectly stated that Andre, Blob, Crito, ElJefe,
     General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil,
     Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann, & Time Agent were
     guilty of the Infraction of Delayed COE Response."

Judge:       General Chaos
Judgement:

Eligible:    Blob, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester,
             Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve,
             Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Kolja A.
Barred:      Chuck
On request:
On hold:


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Kolja A., 22 Jan 1998 22:15:31 +1100
  Assigned to General Chaos, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I quote Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

None of us were "the Player who is required by the Rules to publish the
information subject to a Claim", as I find no Rule that _requires_ anyone to
publish the information subject to this Claim, therefore the Rule states no
allotted time for a Response from any of us. We have therefore not yet
failed to
respond within the (unspecified) allotted time.   :oP
