Promotor's Report of P-Note holdings as of 7 October 1997

This is the easy one. 8)

--------------
Recent events:
--------------

    CFJ 933 judged TRUE on appeal means no P-Notes exist and they have not been
    a Currency since the passage of Pragmatic Currencies.

    Therefore, no Payment Orders or Transfer Orders have ever legally been
    submitted or executed for them.  AFAIK, no one has ever been reported as
    having committed the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness for P-Notes.

Herald's Report as of 7 October 1997

Here's the tough one.  Several things to point out:

1)  This is based on the last preview I posted to discussion which shows
    how I arrived at the current numbers.  If anyone wants a copy of that
    post, let me know - I'll be glad to forward you a copy.

2)  It seems to me, the Rules do not require me to keep a record of
    failed Transfer Orders.  Since all but the delayed TOs for Indulgences
    have failed, for the sake of brevity and clarity I have only included
    the outstanding delayed TOs in the listing below.

3)  I agree with the sentiments I have seen expressed that some sort
    of amnesty is in order for PI Infractions.  My feeling is that it should
    be a general amnesty for *all* PI Infractions up to the point where we
    get the Currencies back in shape.  Therefore I will stop reporting PI
    Infractions as of this report, until we decide that there should be no
    amnesty, or unless some Player forces the issue with a COE.

4)  The outstanding POs have all been renumbered and I have updated the
    delayed TO listing to reflect the current numbers.

5)  I was tempted to reject all outstanding delayed TOs (the Rules allow
    me to do this any time before a delayed TO is executed) just to clear
    the decks, but I figured I should leave this up to the individual
    Players.  Note that it may be to your advantage to cancel some or all of
    your delayed TOs (Harlequin, especially).

    Andre transfers one Kudo FROM G. Chaos TO Oerjan.

    I take one Kudo from General Chaos for baseless Kudo transferring, which
    would have gone to Morendil as the wronged party, were it not for the fact
    that Morendil himself, in my opinion, should lose a Kudo for giving
    unnecessary extra work to the Judge of his CFJ, would that Judge not agree
    with him, but now will be transferred to Oerjan, who often shows to have a
    pleasant and responsible way of playing Nomic.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
