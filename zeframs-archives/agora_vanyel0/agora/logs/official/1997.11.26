Rule 1598/3 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Transfer Order is submitted when the Executor of the source
      entity specified in the Order transmits the Order to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in the Order, or whenever
      the Rules otherwise state that a Transfer Order is submitted.
      Unless otherwise specified, a Transfer Order is executed upon
      being submitted.  In no case may any Transfer Order be executed
      prior to its submission or without having ever been submitted.

      When a Transfer Order is executed, if the source possesses at
      least as many units of the specified Currency as specified in
      the Order, the number of units of that specified Currency shall
      be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
      entity.  Such an Order is said to have been successfully
      executed.

      However, if the source entity does not possess sufficient units
      of the specified Currency, then no transfer occurs, and the
      Recordkeepor shall, as soon as possible, notify the Executors of
      the source and destination that the Transfer Order was not
      successfully executed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

As Zefram has pointed out, "A player is anyone who is registered as a player"
may (especially with game custom backing it) be interpreted as making "player"
and "person who is registered as a player" synonymous.
