AMBASSADOR
=======================================================================

The Office of Ambassador has been held temporarily by Speaker Steve since
1997-10-14T10:37:24Z (Tuesday).  (Morendil was removed from this Office
when e was correctly alleged to be Lawless.)  An Election is therefore
required, with Registrar Zefram as Vote Collector.  The Nominating Period
begins as of this message, and lasts one week.

=======================================================================
CHANCELLOR
=======================================================================

The Nominating Period in the Election for Chancellor ended at
1997-10-15T12:21:03Z (Wednesday).  General Chaos was the only candidate,
and was therefore Elected Chancellor at that time.  Eir Term of Service
ends on 1998-02-01.

=======================================================================
SPEAKER-ELECT
=======================================================================

The Voting Period in the Election for Speaker-Elect ended at
1997-10-15T12:21:03Z (Wednesday).  Candidates were General Chaos and
Morendil.  Quorum was 9.  Votes were:

                    G.C  Mor
		    ---  ---
ChrisM              ********
Chuck                X
elJefe               X
General Chaos        X
Kolja A.                  X
Michael                   X
Morendil                  X
Oerjan               X
Steve                     X
Vir                 ********
Zefram                    X
-----               ---  ---
TOTAL                 4    5

Quorum is achieved, and Morendil is the winner.  Morendil is therefore
Elected to the Office of Speaker-Elect, and eir Term of Service ends
on 1998-02-01.

[R790, "The winner of that Election shall then hold that Office until
e resigns or is retired or removed from that Office." takes precedence
over R1006, "At each time an Office is held by exactly one Player.".]

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 663 permits an Injunction to apply more than one Player.
Therefore it is consistent to read the message in the relevant
Judgement as issuing 4 Injunctions. That the statement of the
Injunctions themselves refers to 'Injunctions' rather than 'an
Injunction' may be considered irrelevant under 754; further, Rule
663 requires that *each* Injunction should specify the Player or
Players to which it applies; thus, this reading is rendered necessary 
as well as legal by Rule 663; for multiple Injunctions to exist, 
mutliple specifications should exist, whereas "all current Officers" 
is merely one specification.

I bar Andre, Steve and elJefe. (The reason for doing so is that as
Justices in the relevant Board of Appeals, each Player named seems
to have already formed a conclusion as to this issue, which
conclusion was not part of what that Board was to consider - it seems
prudent, therefore, to leave a final decision in the hands of Players
who cannot be considered biased.)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

The heart of this judgement clearly lies in counting the number of
Injunctions made by Morendil in CFJ 1045.  Let us do that.

Let us begin by looking at Morendil's first sentence/paragraph containing
at least one Injunction:

---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

There are a few things to consider when trying to determine how many
Injunctions lie in this sentence.  First of all, the word "injunctions" is
used in its plural form.  This implies that there's more than one.
Morendil follows this word, however, with the phrase "applying to all
current Officers".  Therefore, he is making the statement "I hereby issue
Injunctions ..., applying to all current Officers, requiring them ... [to
issue one PO from the Bank to each player]"  Was the word "Injunctions"
used to imply there are more than one, or was it used to imply that there
were more than one Order?

Rule 663 states (in part):

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, the phrases "applying to all current Officers" states the target
of the Injunction(s), and the phrase "requiring them ..." to the end of the
sentence states what the targets are required to perform.  Nowhere in the
sentence/paragraph are further "injunctions" defined.  The first paragraph
therefore contains one injunction.

The second sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can be analyzed exactly as above.  It, also,
contains only one injunction.

The third sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can also be analyzed exactly as above.  It
therefore contains only one injunction.

The last sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)
---

This sentence/paragraph is exactly like the above, only it applies only to
the Registrar, and not all current Officers.

Counting up the total injunctions, I see only four.

The CFJ states that some or all of Andre's PO's of Oct 11 were issued
illegally, as there were no more than four injunctions.

I hereby find CFJ 1055 to be TRUE.

I hereby, as described and permitted by Rule 663, issue an Injunction
applying to Andre requiring em to vacate the Payment Orders POI101 through
POI124, inclusive.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

========================================

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, the phrases "applying to all current Officers" states the target
of the Injunction(s), and the phrase "requiring them ..." to the end of the
sentence states what the targets are required to perform.  Nowhere in the
sentence/paragraph are further "injunctions" defined.  The first paragraph
therefore contains one injunction.

The second sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can be analyzed exactly as above.  It, also,
contains only one injunction.

The third sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can also be analyzed exactly as above.  It
therefore contains only one injunction.

The last sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)
---

This sentence/paragraph is exactly like the above, only it applies only to
the Registrar, and not all current Officers.

Counting up the total injunctions, I see only four.

The CFJ states that some or all of Andre's PO's of Oct 11 were issued
illegally, as there were no more than four injunctions.

I hereby find CFJ 1055 to be TRUE.

I hereby, as described and permitted by Rule 663, issue an Injunction
applying to Andre requiring em to vacate the Payment Orders POI101 through
POI124, inclusive.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)
