OFF:  New Proposals: 3624-3633

Hey, I almost forgot!   There are nine new proposals distributed as of this
report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
E = Emergency
 
D  3624 G. Chaos   1 No Passing the Buck
D  3625 G. Chaos   2 Synonymity
D  3626 G. Chaos   2 Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist
D  3627 G. Chaos   2 Pragmatization of Transfer Orders
D  3628 Murphy     1 Fix Nominations
D  3629 G. Chaos   1 Persistent Judges
D  3630 Crito      1 Ratifications
D  3631 Steve      1 Left In A Huff!
D  3632 Steve      1 Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

======================================================================
Proposal 3624 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No Passing the Buck

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      A Recordkeepor may elect to reject any Transfer Order or Payment
      Order, the amount of which is not specified by its Executor as a
      fixed numeral.

      The actual numerical value of the amount of a Transfer or
      Payment Order whose amount was not specified by its Executor as
      a fixed numeral is whatever the Recordkeepor, in good faith,
      determines it to be at the time the Order was submitted.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a "fixed numeral" is a numerical
      constant specified in a manner that the Recordkeepor may
      determine its value with definite certainty without referring to
      any information in the Game State other than the message
      itself.

[This is to prevent Players from stating that they "execute whatever
 Payment Orders they are required to execute" or "transfer all but two
 VTs to some entity", thereby transferring the responsibility to
 determine what they are legally required to do to Recordkeepors,
 and/or creating uncertainty in Currency Records by specifying
 contingent transfer amounts.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3625 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2  (Disinterested)
Synonymity

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1016 be amended, by appending the
following paragraph:

      "Active" and "Inactive" are unambiguous synonyms for "Off Hold"
      and "On Hold", respectively.

["Active" is used broadly in the Rules, but never defined.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3626 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2  (Disinterested)
Award Oerjan the Title of Exorcist

In recognition of his leadership during the Great Zombie Crisis, let
it be ordered that Oerjan henceforth be known as the Exorcist of Agora
Nomic (a Patent Title).

======================================================================
Proposal 3627 (G. Chaos)  AI = 2  (Disinterested)
Pragmatization of Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended by appending the
following paragraph:

      The determination, for the purpose of this Rule, of whether an
      entity has sufficient Currency to execute a transfer shall be
      made based on the Recordkeepor's records at the time the
      transfer is executed.  A Recordkeepor's good faith determination
      that a transfer has succeeded or failed is definitive, even if
      it is based on erroneous information.

[Believe it or not, this single change is sufficient to eliminate
 almost all indeterminancy regarding the interplay of Currency
 Holdings upon other events.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3628 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Nominations

Amend Rule 1558 by replacing this text:

      * No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
        the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

with this text:

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted Nomination,
        would not be permitted to hold the Office which the Election is
        seeking to fill.

======================================================================
Proposal 3629 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Persistent Judges

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 951 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      randomly select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This
      selection shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
      to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.  

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
      when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir assignment
      to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ by dismissing or
      judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying any outstanding
      judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.  Other Rules may
      prescribe a different time limit or establish procedures by
      which this time limit may be extended or shortened, and this
      Rule defers to them.

      The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
      time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
      carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction thereof)
      that the case remains open beyond the permitted time.  This
      penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

      The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
      cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor does
      it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or grant or
      denial of any related judicial motion which that Judge might
      submit after the limit has expired.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 591 be amended to read:

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT for judging a
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge of that
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

======================================================================
Proposal 3630 (Crito)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Ratifications

The Herald's Report dated December 1, 1997 is hereby ratified.
The most recent Promotor's Report of P-Notes dated December 1, 1997 is hereby
ratified.

[Given the recent Currency Crisis and it's complications, it seems prudent
to ratify the current game state with respect to these Currencies.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3631 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Left In A Huff!

Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann, KoJen, Zefram
and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In A Huff.

======================================================================
Proposal 3632 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Electioneering and the Public Voting Experiment

[Comment: it occurs to me that during the Public Voting Experiment,
we might as well allow the Assessor to publish summaries of everyone's
votes, since votes are being sent to the PF anyway.] 

[Comment: fixed the bug noted by Harlequin.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

with text which reads:

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, and has
      not subsequently been altered, then the Vote Collector is
      permitted to indicate what that vote was, or whether it was a
      declaration of Presence. Otherwise, the Vote Collector is
      prohibited from specifically indicating whether and how the
      Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The publication
      of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime, unless
      specified as such by another Rule.

Rule 1670/4 (Power=1)
The Distributor

      There is a Patent Title of Distributor.  It shall be possessed
      by that person most responsible for the maintenance of the
      Public Forum, as designated by the Registrar.  It shall be
      awarded without need for a proposal when the Registrar
      identifies this person in the Public Forum.  The title shall be
      removed whenever the Registrar designates a new Distributor.

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, at the
      beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out one Voting Token to the
      Distributor, in recognition of eir service.

      The Registrar is obliged to keep the Distributor informed of the
      e-mail addresses of all Players, as well as to inform the
      Distributor of any address changes as soon as possible after e
      learns of it.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.
