The Terms of Service for the Offices of Assessor, Justiciar, Mad Scientist
and Promotor all concluded at Sat, 01 Nov 1997 00:00:00 GMT. The holders
of these Offices are therefore holding them temporarily, and Elections
must be held to fill them in the normal fashion.

I therefore call for nominations for the Offices of Assessor, Justiciar,
Mad Scientist and Promotor. The Nominating Period will last one week,
commencing as of this message.

Proposal 3579 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Stranded Currencies 

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be created with the following
text:

      The Chancellor is empowered to submit Transfer Orders for any
      entity which lacks an Executor, as if e were the Executor of
      that entity, but may do so only as specified by this Rule.

      Whenever there exist units of any Currency in the possession of
      any entity which neither has an Executor nor is in Probate, the
      Chancellor shall (as soon as possible after being made aware of
      this condition) execute Transfer Orders transferring all such
      Currencies to the Bank.

======================================================================
Proposal 3580 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Improper Transfers

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.
      
      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

======================================================================
Proposal 3581 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3582 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal-O-Matic

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

======================================================================
Proposal 3583 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeals Without Objection

     All Players are Empowered to Repeal any Rule over which this Rule 
     takes precedence, Without Objection.

     This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules.

======================================================================
Proposal 3584 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Free-for-All

Let the following rule be created (Title: Duty-Free Days):

     Any Speaker shall have the Right to declare Duty-Free Days if e has 
     not yet done so since e assumed the Speakership.  This Right is 
     exercised by the Speaker making an announcement in the Public Forum 
     that includes the following information:

       i) A declaration that Duty-Free Days are about to begin.
      ii) The time that these Duty-Free Days shall be initiated.
     iii) The duration that the Duty-Free Days shall be in force.

     To be a valid declaration, the time of initiation must occur 
     between 72 hours and one week after the Speaker's announcement.  In 
     addition, the duration of the Duty-Free Days shall be no less than 
     48 hours, and no more than one week.

     While Duty-Free Days are in force, all fees and/or payments that 
     the Rules require of the Players shall be suspended.  The Players 
     may only be assessed fines due to Crimes and Infractions, any other 
     activity for which the Rules require a payment may be performed by 
     the Players at no charge.  This rule takes precedence over all 
     Rules that require payments by the Players.

{Comment: This is another toy for the Speaker.  It serves two purpouses.
          1) A blatant source for political power.
          2) An emergency recovery mechanism in case of economic
             collapse.}

======================================================================
Proposal 3585 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Abolish P-notes by making the following rule changes:


1727: replace the string "one P-note each from the Bank to each Player
who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's BIrth" (in the last
paragraph but two of version 2 of this rule) by "one Voting Token each
from theBank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during
Agora's Birthday"

replace the string " and shall pay out to each such Contest 5
VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each" (in the last
paragraph but one of version 2 of this rule) by "and shall pay out to
each such Contest 5 Voting Tokens."


1451: in the first sentence of the second paragraph, "The Assessor
shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one P-Note.", replace "one
P-note" with "two Voting Tokens".

[It might be simpler to repeal this rule altogether, but then 1065
becomes kind of useless.]


947: replace the string "the Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the
Proposer of that Proposal." by "the Rulekeepor shall pay out one
Voting Token to the Proposer of that Proposal."


1678: replace the string "If an Interested Proposal passes," by "If a
Proposal passes,"


1047: replace the string "When an Interested Proposal Proposed by some
Player" by "When a Proposal Proposed by some Player".

replace the string "the Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that
Player." by "the Assessor shall pay out one Voting Token to that Player."


1705: replace the string "the Wizard shall pay out to each Player with a
positive Style Point rating a number of P-Notes
equal to half their Style," by "the Wizard shall pay out to each
Player with a positive Style Point rating a number of Voting Tokens
equal to a third of their Style,"

Change the title of 1705 to "Voting Tokens for Style".


1723: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested", and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three."


1724: delete the string ", and it is not Disinterested" and the
sentence "The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by
two.

[Question re 1723 and 1724: should a price for making such proposals
reintroduced? How can that be done without keeping the whole petition
fee mechanism just for this purpose?]


1036: replace the string "accompanied by its Number, the identity of
its Proposing Entity, and a clear indication of whether the Proposal
is Disinterested." by "accompanied by its Number and the identity of
its Proposing Entity."


1729: replace the string "An Interested Proposal is Insane," by "Any
Proposal submitted is Insane,"

[Anyone have a better change? I tried to preserve the meter, though
there isn't a clear metric structure of this rule, anyway.]

---

Repeal the following rules:

833 (Awards & Penalties for Proposals)
1583 (Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players)
1701 (Proposal Notes)
1702 (Petition Fee for Proposals)
1623 (Disinterested Proposals)

---

[Comment:

On some occasions P-note rewards or fees are replaced by VT awards,
e.g. 1727, 1451.

In some of these cases I have reduced the amount of VTs, because I
think they are more valuable than P-Notes used to be. Maybe this
could be done even more rigorously.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3586 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Pardons
Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players. The
Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic month, and may not
Pardon the same Player twice in a given term of office (although, if re-elected
later, he may again Pardon that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a
Player by announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
following events may occur:
      1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to eliminate
all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player, and the Herald shall do
so as soon as possible.
      2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any Payment
Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned Player's estate in order to
reduce the number of Blots possessed by the Player's estate to below the
threshhold for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X number
of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number of Indulgences would
suffice to render the Player no longer Lawless.
      3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player may
immediately reregister.
      4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to ten
Prescribed Words in his Pardon.
      5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during this period he must
apply all Indulgences received (from any source) to his debt and may not
transfer them to another Entity.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or Persistent
Indebtedness.

[I was going to originally make this a prerogative of the Speaker, but
Swann's Proposals would already give the Speaker much power and anyway, to CotC
is not paid enough :-)]

======================================================================
Proposal 3587 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Reduce Frivolous Appeals

Amend Rule 1447 by appending the following paragraph:

      If a Judgement, Dismissal or Injunction is Appealed, and the Board
of Appeals unanimously upholds the original Judgment, Dismissal or
Injunction, then the Player or Players who initiated the Appeal have
committed the Infraction of Frivolous Appeal, detected and reported by the
CotC, which carries a penalty of one Blot.

[I think Appeals are too readily made. This seems like a relatively
simple and, hopefully, uncontroversial way to address that problem.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3588 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
We Don' Need No Stinking Game Custom!

Amend Rule 217 by removing the phrase "game custom"

======================================================================
Proposal 3589 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Sunset Stare Decisis

Amend Rule 217 by replacing the phrase "past Judgements" by "past
Judgments handed down within the last six months".

[Note the last two Proposals are independent of one another. Vote for
one, or both, or none, at your pleasure.]
======================================================================
Proposal 3590 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Internomic Encouragement Act

Let the following rule be created:
(Title: Awards for InterNomic Proposals)

     A Player who submits an InterNomic Proposal shall receive the 
     following awards based upon the results of that InterNomic 
     Proposal.  The Ambassador shall pay out these awards as soon as 
     possible after e announces the results of the InterNomic Proposal.

       i) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, and Agora did 
          not vote FOR it, there is no award.
      ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora did 
          vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
     iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award 
          shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

     In addition, if the adoption of the InterNomic Proposal directly 
     results in Agora receiving enough InterNomic points to win a game 
     of InterNomic, the Player who submitted that InterNomic Proposal 
     shall Win the Game (of Agora).

{Comment: Some encoragement for submitting IN Proposals, and a reward
          for having Agora win.}

======================================================================
Proposal 3591 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Pitchfork

Let Rule 1675 (Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers) be repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3592 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Remove Silliness

Let Rules 1650 (The Silly Person) and 1651 (The Silly Proposal) be
repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3593 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
InterNomic Proposal cleanup

Amend Rule 1633 (InterNomic Proposals) to read:

      Players are permitted to submit InterNomic Proposals, which are
      distinct from Proposals in Agora, by sending to the Ambassador
      a text which is clearly intended to become an InterNomic
      Proposal. If a Player does so, the Ambassador shall be required
      to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance
      to InterNomic procedures.

      In no case shall such submission, or the distribution by the
      Ambassador of text clearly labeled as InterNomic Proposals cause
      the Proposing of Proposals in Agora, any Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

[Explanation:
Removes the restriction to one IN Proposal per Player per week,
disinfects the Rule (it still contained the old Virus sentence!),
and improved the wording.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3594 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Shorten InterNomic Voting Period

Amend Rule 1632 (InterNomic Voting Procedure) by replacing the phrase

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until one week before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

by:

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until 72 hours before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

[Explanation:
Avoids short (if the Ambassador happens to be slow) or even negative
(if the Ambassador happens to be Tardy) Voting Periods.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3595 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Liaison? Which Liaison?

Amend Rule 1634 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's"
Amend Rule 1631 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's" in all
its concurrences.

======================================================================
Proposal 3596 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Amend 1715 by replacing the sentence       

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to the Assessor to that
      effect.

with

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote 
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

[At the same time, correct the spelling error in the rule's title so it
reads "Announcing One's Presence" (not "Annoucing").]

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 03 Nov 1997

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report:

The Agora referendum on INP 349 ended with a split vote: 3 FOR, 3
AGAINST and one declaration of presence. Therefore, Agora abstained
from the vote on this proposal by not voting at all.

Currently up for vote is the referendum on INP 350. The voting period
lasts until Sat, 08 Nov 1997 14:57:45 -0400. The text of this proposal
follows (yes, the text appears twice, I messed up my mail to the IN
list :(

---INP 350---

Let the following rule be created:

     Any nomic that objects to the actions of a player in Internomic may 
     make a formal protest by sending a message to the moderator 
     detailing the objectionable act the nomic is protesting.  The 
     moderator must then make the protest known to all players of 
     Internomic.  Voting players of Internomic may second the protest by 
     sending a message to the moderator stating that they agree the act 
     is objectionable.  If, within five days of the protest being made 
     known, at least one voting player of Internomic (other than the 
     nomic making the formal protest) seconds the formal protest, the 
     moderator shall call a vote on sanctions.  No formal protests shall
     be permitted while a vote on shanctions is taking place.

     Immediatly after the moderator calls for a vote on sanctions, the 
     moderator shall collect votes form all voting members for a period 
     of two weeks.  Immediately after this period, e shall make known 
     the results, which shall be as follows;

       i) If 25% or less of voting members voted FOR sanctions;

          protests for a period of two months after the vote's 
          conclusion.
          Any nomic that seconded the protest shall loose 5 points.

      ii) If more than 25% and less than 50% of voting members voted FOR
          sanctions;
          If the protesting nomic is a player, it shall lose 7 points.
          The protesting nomic shall be forbidden from making any formal 
          protests for a period of one month after the vote's 
          conclusion.

          The player being protested shall lose 10 points.

A Revolt has just occurred: Andre, Crito, Kolja, Murphy, Vir and Vlad
have all Rebelled.

In accordance with R1664, then, the following occur:

The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. The Speaker-Elect is currently
Morendil, who is not a Player. He becomes Speaker, and therefore
a Player, in accordance with Rule 103.

All Players are retired from whatever Offices they hold.

All Rebellious Players become Abiding again.

As a result of the Revolt, the remaining Offices for which Elections
were not already being held are now being held temporarily and must
have Elections held for them to fill them in the normal fashion.

I therefore call for nominations for the Offices of Ambassador, Archivist,
Cartographor, Chancellor, Clerk of the Courts, Commander-in-Chief, Herald,
Rulekeepor, and Speaker-Elect. The Nominating Periods will last one week,
commencing as of this message.

Registrar pro-tem Steve, who sympathizes with the Assessor. And I didn't
even ask for this job.
