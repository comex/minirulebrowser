I hereby order the Bank to pay Steve 1 VT as his judicial salary.

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1092

 If a Player with nonzero Score deregisters and later re-registers,
 eir Score is the same as it was when e deregistered.

======================================================================

Judge:        Steve

Judgement:    TRUE

Eligible:     Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, Harlequin, Jester, Kolja A.,
              Michael, Morendil, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann

Not eligible:
Caller:       Murphy
Barred:       -
Disqualified: -
On hold:      Antimatter, General Chaos

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Murphy, Sat, 18 Apr 1998 07:18:20 -0700
  Assigned to Steve, Mon, 20 Apr 1998 09:15:48 +0100
  Judged TRUE, Tue, 21 Apr 1998 10:59:21 +1000
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

I Judge that the Statement is TRUE. R1432 is relevant here: when an
ex-Player reregisters, e is the same Player. Since no Rule states that
a Player's Score is changed by the act of deregistration, I draw the
conclusion that a reregistering ex-Player resumes with same Score e
had when e deregistered, as the Caller alleges.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1775 says "Only a Player can have a Score" but doesn't say what
happens when an ex-Player re-registers.  As a candidate for
Scorekeepor, I'd like to know whether Time Agent will get his Score of
-13 back if e ever re-registers.


List of relevant Rules:


Rule 1775/0 (Power=1)
Points and Scoring

      Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value
      known as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an
      integer.  If the rules specify a non-integral change in a
      Player's Score, that change shall be rounded to the nearest
      integer before being applied.

      Only a Player can have a Score.

      Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or
      loss of Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that
      number is to be added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number
      of Points means that number is to be subtracted from a Player's
      Score.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with
      Points and Scoring.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Proposal  (Harlequin) AI = 1
Electees

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.

      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 910 ("The Justiciar") by replacing the text:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with the text:

      If the Justiciar ever becomes Clerk of the Courts, e is removed
      from the Office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

      and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

with the text:

      and the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by its Electee.

and the text:

      only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion

with the text:

      only until the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by an
      Electee who is not the Speaker.

Amend Rule 833 ("Awards & Penalties for Proposals") by replacing the text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,

      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during

[Comment: As Steve pointed out, we lack a regular supply of P-Notes.
This relates supply to spending, but with a bit of complexity. You can
turn a profit by making lots of Proposals with Priority 1, but you have to
make sure they get distributed, and that they pass, which is not easy.]

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      1 for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the Referendum
      fails.

with:

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the 
      Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption Index
      for a Referendum is 1.

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach An Officer") by replaing the
text:

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the

Riot Act

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Inciting to Riot}

Any Player who is Rebellious continually for a period in excess of one
month shall be guilty of the Infraction of Inciting To Riot. This
Infraction shall be reported by the Registrar, and upon the report of
the Infraction the Player becomes Abiding.

The penalty for this Infraction shall be one Blot, plus one additional
Blot for each instance the player switched from Abiding to Rebellious
since the last Rebellion.

{Comment: Thinking thoughts about rebellion, it strikes me that the one
          reason that rebellion is so easy is because Players can be 
          rebellious effectively permanently.  (Players such as myself 
          :)  This rule forces a little cost into the Rebellion picture 
          without changing the mechanism.  (sort of a converse of the 
          Miscreant proposal.)}

Non-Pejorative Elective Tools.

Rule 1660 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1659 is amended by replacing each instance of the word "Tainted"
with the phrase "in Transition."

Rule 1661 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1648 has its title change to, "When the Speaker is in Transition."
Rule 1648 is amended by replacing each instance of the phrase "Speaker
is Tainted" with the phrase "Speaker is in Transition," and replacing
the phrase "A Tainted Speaker," with the phrase, "A Speaker in
Transition."

Rule 1658 has its title change to, "Calling for a Speaker Transition."
Rule 1658 is amended to read as follows;

      A Speaker shall be forced into Transition when a Referendum
      calling for a Speaker Transition passes. Any Active Player is 
      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting 
      such to the Public Forum.

      If this Referendum passes, and a Speaker Transition has not
      occurred since the Referendum was called, then the Speaker shall
      be placed in Transition upon the announcement of the Referendum's 
      results.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and the Adoption Ratio
      required for passage is 2.

{Comment: There is a pejorative cast to the word Tainted, this replaces
          the term with the more neutral "in Transition."  Rule 1658 is 
          rewritten to remove some other pejorative language "such as 
          offending Speaker."  With this redone, there should be less of 
          a moral cast to this whole process, allowing more political 
          use of the process. Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}

Rule 1486 has its title change to, "Public Calls for Elections."
Rule 1486 is amended to read as follows;

     Any Active Player is permitted call a Referendum known as a Public 
     Call for Elections.  This is done by requesting such a Referendum
     in the Public Forum.  Such a call must list one or more Offices 
     that are subject to this Public Call for Elections.  Upon passage 
     of this Referendum, any listed Office that has not been filled by 
     an election since the Referendum was called shall become held 
     temporarily.

     For a Public Call for Elections the default procedure for referenda
     is modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum.

     Such a Referendum can be declared a Call for Impeachment.  Such a 
     call must be clearly identified as such, can only list one Office, 
     and must identify the Player holding the listed Office.  If
     that Player still holds the Office upon passage of the Call for 
     Impeachment, e shall immediately be removed from the listed Office.

     For a Call for Impeachment, the default procedure for referenda is
     modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum, Voting Entities do not include the Officer under 
     consideration for Impeachment, and the Adoption Ratio required
     for passage is 2.

{Comment: Created a less offensive way for the public to wield some
          power vs. Officers.  It gives the Players the Speaker-like 
          right to call elections (should they gain a majority
support.)  
          I retained impeachment as impeachment, since there should 
          be a means of emergency Officer removal if someone is truly
          damaging the game.  (The former only forces an election, the 
          latter boots the person out of Office, dumping it on the 
          Speaker.)  Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}

Power of Attorney

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that 
     means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for 
     as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

     No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than two 
     other Players.

     text, delimited by three asterisks;
     ***
     PROPOSAL (Fix the Coercion/Bribery Loophole)
     This Proposal shall have an AI=2

          Rule 1561 is amended to read as follows.

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.


          {Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to 
                     bribes to vote FOR or AGAINST.  It's perfectly
                     legal to bribe someone to not vote at all, or 
                     declare presence, or even ABSTAIN.}

               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
          {Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to

          Coercion or Bribery}with a Power=2;

               If an SLC, or other agency created by the Rules, bribes
               players to vote, not vote, declare presence, or buy back
               quorum, then no Proposal which has as part of its effect
               the award of any currency to that entity, or to entities
               under the control of that entity, shall take effect,
               even if adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
               notwithstanding.

         {Comment: Fixes the hole that permitted the bribery done by my
                   Contest.}

     Win the game immediately thereafter.  This rule takes precedence
     over all other rules defining win-preventing conditions and the

Proposal 3735 (Swann) AI = 1
Coercion through the back door v3 w/Contest

Let the following Rule be created {Title: Fix the Loopholes};

     This Rule is a Proposing Entity.  The Proposal this Rule submits 
     shall have its Priority raised to five immediately after its
     submission.  This Rule's Proposal shall consist of the following 
     text, delimited by three asterisks;
     ***
     PROPOSAL (Fix the Coercion/Bribery Loophole)
     This Proposal shall have an AI=2

          Rule 1561 is amended to read as follows.

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.


          {Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to 
                     bribes to vote FOR or AGAINST.  It's perfectly
                     legal to bribe someone to not vote at all, or 
                     declare presence, or even ABSTAIN.}

          Rule 1003 is amended to read as follows.

               Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a 
               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
          {Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to
                    coercing a vote, not a declaration of presence &c.}

          Create a Rule with the following text {Title: No Indirect
          Coercion or Bribery}with a Power=2;

               If an SLC, or other agency created by the Rules, bribes
               players to vote, not vote, declare presence, or buy back
               quorum, then no Proposal which has as part of its effect
               the award of any currency to that entity, or to entities
               under the control of that entity, shall take effect,
               even if adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
               notwithstanding.

         {Comment: Fixes the hole that permitted the bribery done by my
                   Contest.}              
     ***
     This Rule's Proposal shall be deemed to have been submitted upon 
     the enactment of this Rule.  This Rule shall repeal itself 
     immediately after this Proposal is distributed.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Do you want to vote against this?}

      For the Purpose of this Rule, the term "The Coercive Proposal"
      shall refer to the Proposal that created this Rule and the term
      *Contestmaster* shall refer to the Contestmaster of the Contest
      named *Swann*s Ragtime Band.*

      As soon as possible after the Adoption of this Rule, the
      Contestmaster shall bill every entity that voted upon The Coercive 
      Proposal (except the Contestmaster and current Contestants of 
      Swann's Ragtime Band) the sum of three Indulgences for each vote 
      that entity cast.  The Contestmaster shall also pay out one 
      Indulgence to every Player that did not vote on the Coercive 
      Proposal (excepting the Contestmaster and current Contestants of 
      Swann's Ragtime Band) 

      As soon as possible after the Adoption of this Rule, the
      Contestmaster shall bill every Player who did not declare presence 
      on The Coercive Proposal (excepting those Players who were on Hold 
      during all of the Coercive Proposal's Voting Period, and the 
      Contestmaster and current Contestants of Swann's Ragtime Band) for 
      the sum of four Voting Tokens. The Contestmaster shall also pay 
      out two Voting tokens to every Player who declared Presence on the
      Coercive Proposal (excepting the Contestmaster and current 
      Contestants of Swann's Ragtime Band). 

      As soon as possible after the Adoption of this Rule, the
      Contestmaster shall pay out 2 P-Notes, and one Voting Token to
      every Player who bought back Quorum on the Coercive Proposal.

      As soon as possible after the Adoption of this Rule, the
      Contestmaster shall pay out 15 Indulgences 25 Voting Tokens to the 
      Contest Named Swann's Ragtime Band.

      This Rule shall repeal itself once all transfers mandated by it 
      are successfully completed.


Let the following Rule be created, {Title: A Win for Swann}

     Immediately upon enactment of this Rule, all win-preventing 
     conditions are removed from Player Swann, specifically, Swann
     is both empowered and required to vacate all outstanding Blots
     possessed by Swann.  Once this is done, Player Swann shall 
     Win the game immediately thereafter.  This rule takes precedence
     over all other rules defining win-preventing conditions and the
     vacation of Payment Orders. Player Swann shall report this win.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT May 1 1998

======================================================================
Proposal 3736 (Blob) AI = 3
Fix the Proposal Queue

Amend Rule 106 ("Adopting Proposals") to read:

      All Proposals made and distributed in the proper way shall
      be voted upon.  A Proposal shall be adopted if and only if
      it receives the required number of votes and if Quorum is 
      achieved.

[Comment: Allows undistributed proposals to never be voted upon.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3737 (Swann) AI = 1
Riot Act

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Inciting to Riot}

Any Player who is Rebellious continually for a period in excess of one
month shall be guilty of the Infraction of Inciting To Riot. This
Infraction shall be reported by the Registrar, and upon the report of
the Infraction the Player becomes Abiding.

The penalty for this Infraction shall be one Blot, plus one additional
Blot for each instance the player switched from Abiding to Rebellious
since the last Rebellion.

{Comment: Thinking thoughts about rebellion, it strikes me that the one
          reason that rebellion is so easy is because Players can be 
          rebellious effectively permanently.  (Players such as myself 
          :)  This rule forces a little cost into the Rebellion picture 
          without changing the mechanism.  (sort of a converse of the 
          Miscreant proposal.)}

======================================================================
Proposal 3738 (Swann) AI = 1
Non-Pejorative Elective Tools.

Rule 1660 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1659 is amended by replacing each instance of the word "Tainted"
with the phrase "in Transition."

Rule 1661 is amended by replacing the word "Tainted" with the phrase
"in Transition."

Rule 1648 has its title change to, "When the Speaker is in Transition."
Rule 1648 is amended by replacing each instance of the phrase "Speaker
is Tainted" with the phrase "Speaker is in Transition," and replacing
the phrase "A Tainted Speaker," with the phrase, "A Speaker in
Transition."

Rule 1658 has its title change to, "Calling for a Speaker Transition."
Rule 1658 is amended to read as follows;

      A Speaker shall be forced into Transition when a Referendum
      calling for a Speaker Transition passes. Any Active Player is 
      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting 
      such to the Public Forum.

      If this Referendum passes, and a Speaker Transition has not
      occurred since the Referendum was called, then the Speaker shall
      be placed in Transition upon the announcement of the Referendum's 
      results.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and the Adoption Ratio
      required for passage is 2.

{Comment: There is a pejorative cast to the word Tainted, this replaces
          the term with the more neutral "in Transition."  Rule 1658 is 
          rewritten to remove some other pejorative language "such as 
          offending Speaker."  With this redone, there should be less of 
          a moral cast to this whole process, allowing more political 
          use of the process. Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}

Rule 1486 has its title change to, "Public Calls for Elections."
Rule 1486 is amended to read as follows;

     Any Active Player is permitted call a Referendum known as a Public 
     Call for Elections.  This is done by requesting such a Referendum
     in the Public Forum.  Such a call must list one or more Offices 
     that are subject to this Public Call for Elections.  Upon passage 
     of this Referendum, any listed Office that has not been filled by 
     an election since the Referendum was called shall become held 
     temporarily.

     For a Public Call for Elections the default procedure for referenda
     is modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum.

     Such a Referendum can be declared a Call for Impeachment.  Such a 
     call must be clearly identified as such, can only list one Office, 
     and must identify the Player holding the listed Office.  If
     that Player still holds the Office upon passage of the Call for 
     Impeachment, e shall immediately be removed from the listed Office.

     For a Call for Impeachment, the default procedure for referenda is
     modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
     the Referendum, Voting Entities do not include the Officer under 
     consideration for Impeachment, and the Adoption Ratio required
     for passage is 2.

{Comment: Created a less offensive way for the public to wield some
          power vs. Officers.  It gives the Players the Speaker-like 
          right to call elections (should they gain a majority
support.)  
          I retained impeachment as impeachment, since there should 
          be a means of emergency Officer removal if someone is truly
          damaging the game.  (The former only forces an election, the 
          latter boots the person out of Office, dumping it on the 
          Speaker.)  Also fixed the Adoption Ratio bug.}

======================================================================
Proposal 3739 (Swann) AI = 1
Power of Attorney

Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Granting Power of Attorney}

     Any Player who has been continuously registered for two or more 
     months is empowered to give another willing Player eir Power of 
     Attorney for a specified period of time.  The giving Player shall 
     be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving Player 
     shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

     Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor posting in the Public 
     Forum, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to, and 
     the time period for which the Power of Attorney shall given.  To be 
     effective, this post must name a time that begins within the week 
     following the posting. The Power of Attorney shall not be granted 
     unless the Holder is an active Player and consents in the Public 
     Forum before the beginning of the specified period of time.

     If the grant is effective, the Holder shall then have the Power of 
     Attorney beginning at the specified time.  This grant shall end 
     when one of the following occurs;

       i) The period specified expires.
      ii) The Grantor posts in the Public Forum that e is withdrawing 
          eir Power of Attorney.
     iii) The Grantor is deregistered, or goes On Hold.
      iv) The Holder is deregistered, or goes On Hold
       v) It has been over three months since the Grantor gave eir Power 
          of Attorney to the Holder.


Let the following Rule be created;
{Title: Power of Attorney}

     In certain specified circumstances the Rules may grant one Player, 
     hereafter called the Holder, Power of Attorney for another Player, 
     hereafter called the Grantor.  Such a grant shall only occur when 
     specified by the Rules, and shall last only as long as the Rules 
     permit.

     When the Holder is granted Power of Attorney for the Grantor, that 
     means that the Holder becomes the sole Executor for the Grantor for 
     as long as e has that Power of Attorney.

     No Player is permitted to have Power of Attorney for more than two 
     other Players.

[Comment: too many P-Notes, too many Indulgences, too many VTs. Time
to start again, again.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Tabula Rasa", be created
with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, all Voting Tokens, Proposal
      Notes and Indulgences are destroyed. Further, all obligations
      on the Chancellor to transfer Currency incurred under the
      authority of Rule 1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank) are
      cancelled. Further, all unsatisfied Payment Orders naming any
      Player as Payor are vacated.

      Within three days after the creation of this Rule, the
      Chancellor shall pay out to each Player seven Voting Tokens
      and 1 Proposal Note.

[Comment: basically, besides destroying all Currencies (and then
giving a limited amount back), this also cancels nearly all POs,
leaving only Officer Salaries alone. The Proposal gives seven
VTs back, rather than, say, five, because under the new billing
system, Players will have to pay for their votes on the batch of
Proposals containing this one after this Proposal is adopted, which
is to say after nearly all VTs have been destroyed. If we're going to
destroy all Indulgences, it's only fair to cancel all Blots.]

Be it further resolved that R1754 (Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank)
be repealed.

[Comment: As Scott points out, after Omnibus Reform, this Rule is
superfluous, since Players can vacate inadvertent transfers. So why
keep the reference to R1754 in the provision above if the Rule is
being repealed? Because I'm not sure that the repeal of the Rule
would result in the cancellation of obligations already incurred
under its authority before its repeal.]

Be it further resolved that R1465 (Champion's Reward) be amended
by replacing the text "ten Voting Tokens" with the text "four
Voting Tokens".

[Comment: it's been clear for quite a while that this reward
is too generous.]

Be it further resolved that R1654 (Rewards for Doctors of Nomic
History) be repealed.

[Comment: we could lower the reward as in R1465, but the Rule has
hardly been effective in encouraging submissions for the Degree of
D.N.Hist, has it?]

   3735 Swann          1 Coercion through the back door v3 w/Contest

Style Change: +3 

Always nice to see a good, juicy scam. But why the mechanism of having
the Proposal create a Rule which is a Proposing Entity and which in turn
submits a Proposal?

   3736 Blob           3 Fix the Proposal Queue

Style Change: 0

A small fix; Style neutral.

   3737 Swann          1 Riot Act

Style Change: 0

I don't much like this Proposal (I don't think it works well with Risky
Rebellion), but that in itself is not a reason for deducting Style Points.

   3738 Swann          1 Non-Pejorative Elective Tools

Style Change: -1

I think it's disingenuous to suggest that changing what an action is
called changes what it is. 

   3739 Swann          1 Power of Attorney

Style Change: +2

A very interesting new toy to play with!
