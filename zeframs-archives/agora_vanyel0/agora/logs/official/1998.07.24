Scorekeepor's Report

Date of this Report: Fri, 24 Jul 1998
Date of last Report: Sun, 21 Jun 1998

NB: This Report is certainly imcomplete. For example, with one
exception, none of the Players who have had Rule-changing Proposals
passed since the passage of P3757 on June 12 have had the appropriate
increases to their Scores noted. I hope Chuck can confirm that he did
order these Score changes, and perhaps even when he ordered them.
Undoubtedly, other Score changes are also missing. These will have to
corrected as they come to light.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3774 (Crito) AI = 1
Making On Hold Safe Again

Amend Rule 1713 by replacing the following text:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied.

with the text:

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which is presently
      effective, has been effective for more than seven days, and has
      not been satisfied, unless the Payment Order was issued while the
      Payor was On Hold, in which case the Payment Order becomes overdue
      if it has been effective and unsatisfied for more than seven days
      after the Payor first comes Off Hold.

[All of the other solutions seemed to me to be more complicated and to open up
other possible holes.  This is the simplest way to force Players to pay off all
debts before going On Hold and then give them the full seven days to pay off
anything that came due while they were away.]
