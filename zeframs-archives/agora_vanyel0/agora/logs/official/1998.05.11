  Judged FALSE, Mon, 11 May 1998 11:03:00 +0100
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

I hold that one commits the Infraction of Inciting to Riot by failing
to become Abiding within a month of last becoming Rebellious.
Further, at any given time it is easy to determine whether or not
someone has committed the Infraction: we ask "Are they rebellious, and
have they been so for the last month or more?"  This is clearly the
easiest and most sensible reading of the rule as it will come to
operate in the months after its passage.  This case is only
interesting because it involves a Player who became Rebellious before
the passage of the Proposal defining the Infraction.

Further support to this view comes from Real World practice when
similar laws are enacted.  For example, in Britain the gun laws were
recently tightened to make it illegal to posses various forms of
hand-gun.  This legislation could have been phrased so as to instantly
make criminals of all those who had been holding guns that had been
legal up to this point.  Rather than do something so unfair, the
Government allowed for an Amnesty Period.  In not doing something
similar in Agora, the proposal creating the Rule defining the
Infraction of Inciting to Riot has made instant "criminals" of
Morendil and Harlequin.

The Caller makes two further claims.  Firstly he claims that Rule 1513
"Authority of non-rule entities" exempts him from being subject to the
Infraction as the rule was not available to him at the time when he
became Rebellious.  This is suspect for two reasons.  The first is
that there is a strong case that R1513 does not restrict the power of
the rules when its third paragraph states "No Nomic Entity is
permitted to require...."  The whole scope of the rule in question is
non-rule entities, so to suppose that this third paragraph is now
talking about the rules as well as the non-rule entities it has been
talking about hitherto is suspect.

Secondly, the claim that R1513 prevents the Infraction from being
applied is countered by the fact that Morendil did have the text of
the putative rule available to him before he became liable to the
Infraction.  This is because the rule was necessarily published in
proposal form before becoming a rule.  The fact that this text was not
available to him when he Rebelled is irrelevant as he committed the
Infraction on failing to become Abiding a month later.

The final argument presented by the Caller is that Morendil is not
liable to the Infraction because at the time of the detection and
reporting of the Infraction he had become Abiding, and thus performed
the duty required of him.  This argument is akin to claiming that
eventually submitting a late judgement for a CFJ exempts one from the
penalty for late judgement if that Infraction has not yet been
detected and reported.  We well know that Agoran practice, custom and
law does not suport this view.  At the time of the passage of the
proposal establishing the Infraction, Morendil instantaneously
committed it.  That this was only detected and reported after Morendil
had attempted become Abiding is irrelevant.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Rule states "Any Player who *is* Rebellious continually for a
period in excess of one month" (emphasis mine), not "Any Player who
has been". Further, the clause "upon the report of the Infraction the
Player becomes Abiding" seems to indicate that the report of the
Infraction must occur when the relevant Player is still Rebellious.

Further, I note that Infractions are defined thusly :

Rule 1812/0 (Power=1)
Notices of Infraction

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

Infractions are of two kinds : actions and failures to perform an
action. The determination of penalties for is as defined as follows :

Rule 1814/0 (Power=1)
Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

If the Infraction of Inciting to Riot results from "performing an
action", it is therefore clear that I am not subject to any penalties;
the only action that I performed that could be relevant was Rebelling,
and at the time I did that no penalties were defined.

If that Infraction results from "failure to perform an action", the
issue becomes a little more complex. The action I putatively failed to
perform was to switch from Rebellious to Abiding within some
prescribed period. The Riot Act defines this period to be one
continous month; however I question that this period can be considered
to have started as of the time I became Rebellious.

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

     [...]

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

The Riot Act was not "available" to any Player at the time I last
became Rebellious, so I could not at that time have become required to
switch back to Abiding within one month.

I further question, no matter which interpretation is correct, that I
'failed to perform' the action required of me under the Riot act. At
the time of Michael's alleged Notice of Infraction, any such failure
had been corrected by my becoming Abiding again.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

      to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or
      decreased by one as specified by the Player making the payment,
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose. The Priority of a Proposal may not be reduced below
      zero in this manner. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
The Levers of Monetary Policy

[Comment: this Proposal introduces two new levers for control over
monetary policy: it gives the Accountor the ability, by levying
taxes, to keep the number of VTs in circulation limited to what I
have called the Voting Token Circulation Level, which e can set, and
it give the Chancellor the power to set the Basic Officer Salary. The
aim here is to give us flexibility; we can adjust important economic
parameters without having to pass a Proposal. Also, these decisions
then become a matter of Officer politics, which should be interesting.
I have written the Taxation Rule so that it covers the cases of other
Currencies, should we wish to extend the use of this tool to cover them.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Circulation of Voting
Tokens" be created with the following text:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Levying Taxes" be created
with the following text:

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities).
      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.

with text which reads 

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "The Chancellor can set
the Basic Officer Salary" be created with the following text:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 2 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Trumpet Mk II.

Special Note:  There is no "scam" left in this proposal, Neither I or
               anyone else gains a whit from this. (Except a Patent
               Title denied me by a typo.)

Formatting Note:  The Rules created by this proposal are delimited by
"===" to help distinguish them.  The non-proposed Rule creations are
delimited by "***."  Instruments created by Rules are between quotes.


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: The Trumpet};

===

     There is an instrument known as a Trumpet.  The only Trumpets that 
     may exist are those created by the Rules created by the Proposal
     that created this Rule.  All Trumpets have a Power of 4.  Trumpets 
     are bodies of text defined by the Rules.  Trumpets have an 
     initialization clause and a resolution clause.  Rule Changes (and 
     other effects) defined in the initialization Clause of a Trumpet 
     take effect immediately after the Rule Creating the Trumpet is 
     created.  Rule Changes (and other effects) defined in the 
     resolution clause of a Trumpet take effect at the time defined in 
     the text of the Trumpet, or immediately after the initialization 
     clause takes effect if such a time is unspecified.  A Rule defining 
     a Trumpet shall be repealed as soon as all provisions in the 
     Trumpet it defines have taken effect.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:01 GMT on Aug. 1st 1998.

===

{Comment: Guess what?  Read the Ruleset Week paid off with a major
          loophole.  There is nothing to prevent a Power=1 Rule from 
          defining an instrument of arbitrary Power.  Proposals are 
          fairly well delimited, and Rules can't directly change Rules
          of higher power, but through this back door a Rule can define
          an instrument to alter any other Rule at its whim.  Ain't 
          this neat?  I've also noticed a few more loopholes
          to follow;) }


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Bonus Clauses?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1561 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Illegality of Bonus Clauses};

                ***

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.

                ***"

===

{Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to bribes to
           vote FOR or AGAINST.  I'm surprised no one exploited this 
           when Presence was created.  It's perfectly legal to bribe 
           someone to not vote at all, or declare presence, or even
           ABSTAIN.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Coercive Proposals?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1003 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: No Coercive Proposals};

               ***

               Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a 
               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
               ***"

===

{Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to coercing
           a vote, not a declaration of presence &c.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: Slamming shut the back door.}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
           The following rule is created with an Power=3
           (text delimited by "***")
           {Title: What I get out of this.};

                ***

                Player Swann gains the Patent Title of "Loose Cannon."

                This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on Aug. 
                1st 1998.

                ***

          {Title: Limits on the Power of Instruments};

               ***

               No instrument can create another instrument with a Power 
               greater than its own Power.  This Rule takes precedence 
               over any Rule that specifies the Power of the created
               instrument.  Proposals are explicitly exempt from this
               provision.

               In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
               a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
               Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
               Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
               Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
               effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
               Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

               If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
               specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the 
               Power of the new instrument is 1.

Rule 1766 is amended to read as follows;

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by a Voting Entity.

Plot Repair

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with this text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially
      owned by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name
      Without Objection.

Create a Rule entitled "Adjacency" with this text:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.
      Two Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

      For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y)
      from 0 to 9:

        * If a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the
          Longitude for "Y") already exists, its Latitude and Longitude are set
          to X and Y, respectively.
        * If no such Plot exists, then a Plot with that name, Latitude and
          Longitude is created.

Create a Rule entitled "The Cartographor" with this text:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures
          since the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the
          last Report

======================================================================
Proposal 3747 (Steve) AI = 1
The Levers of Monetary Policy

[Comment: this Proposal introduces two new levers for control over
monetary policy: it gives the Accountor the ability, by levying
taxes, to keep the number of VTs in circulation limited to what I
have called the Voting Token Circulation Level, which e can set, and
it give the Chancellor the power to set the Basic Officer Salary. The
aim here is to give us flexibility; we can adjust important economic
parameters without having to pass a Proposal. Also, these decisions
then become a matter of Officer politics, which should be interesting.
I have written the Taxation Rule so that it covers the cases of other
Currencies, should we wish to extend the use of this tool to cover them.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Circulation of Voting
Tokens" be created with the following text:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Levying Taxes" be created
with the following text:

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities).
      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.

with text which reads 

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "The Chancellor can set
the Basic Officer Salary" be created with the following text:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 2 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the Week.
