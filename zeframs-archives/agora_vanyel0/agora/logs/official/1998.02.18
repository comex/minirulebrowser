OFF:  New Proposals: 3695 - 3697, 3699

There are four new proposals distributed as of this report.  The Voting Period
on these Proposals commences as of this message and will end on Saturday,
February 28.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
s = Sane
E = Emergency
I = Insane

S  3695 Steve          2 A Foolish Holiday
   3696 Kolja A.       1 Points Cosmetics
   3697 Kolja A.       1 Points for IN participation
   3699 Kolja A.       1 Unemployment benefits

======================================================================
Proposal 3695 (Steve)  AI = 2  (Silly)
A Foolish Holiday

The Silly Person humbly pleads,
Create a Rule forthwith which reads:

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!

======================================================================
Proposal 3696 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1
Points Cosmetics

Amend the rule titled "Changing a Player's Score" by replacing "eim"
with "em".

Amend the rule titled "Initiating an Endgame Procedure" by replacing
the paragraph

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated one week from 
     the date of its initiation, unless the Rules require an earlier 
     termination.

with

     An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated as soon as
     it has been unchallenged for seven consecutive days, unless the 
     Rules require an earlier termination.

======================================================================
Proposal 3697 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1
Points for IN participation

Amend the rule titled "The Omnibus Scoring Rule" by appending the
paragraph 

     In any week where a Player Voted in at least one referendum on
     an Internomic proposal, e gains one Point. The Ambassador must 
     order this Score change.

======================================================================
Proposal 3699 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1
Unemployment benefits

Create a new rule titled "VT unemployment benefits"

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay 
     out to every player who does not receive any Officer's Salary 
     for the previous week an unemployment benefit of half a Basic 
     Officer Salary. 

[Comment: This is just a quick fix; if plots (or jobs and wages) are
reproposed, it is a trivial thing to repeal the rule created by this
proposal again.]
