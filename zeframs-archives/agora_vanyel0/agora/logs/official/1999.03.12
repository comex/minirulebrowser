This message contains two Proposals for submission. The text of
each proposal is delimited by ten hyphens. Each rule change
in a Proposal is marked with a *. I then transfer two P-Notes
to the Bank for the purpose of increasing the Priority of each
of these Proposals by 1.

The first Proposal is entitled "Raus mit der Zeitgeist u. a."
It reads as follows:

----------
* Rule 1047 "Patent Title of Zeitgeist" is hereby repealed.

* Amend Rule 649 to read as follows:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent
      Titles can be possessed only by persons.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such Titles which have no Historical 
      Significance. For the purposes of this Rule, any Title defined
      by the Rules to have no Historical SIgnificance has none. In
      addition, the Registrar may Act to declare any Title not
      referred to in th Rules to be without Historical Significance
      Without Objection. If such an action successfully occurs, then
      that Title also has no Historical Significance.

      This list is known as the Gold Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

----------

The second Proposal has the title "Cleaning up the Grand Agoran
Tournament". It reads as follows:


----------
* Amend Rule 1877 "Competitions" by replacing the paragraph reading:

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
        i) The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
       ii) No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
      iii) No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
           Team.
      If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team
      is immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team
      Competition.

with one reading:

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
        i) The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
       ii) No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
      iii) No proposed Team Member may belong to another Team.
      If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team
      is immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team
      Competition.

* Amend Rule 1879 "Scoring" by removing the paragraph reading:

      If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED
      (in any order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

* Amend Rule 1875 "The Grand Agoran Tournament" by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
      These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and
      October of each year, and last for three months. The first Round
      begins March 1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the
      Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
      descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For
      the first Round, this will be done instead in descending order
      of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the
      most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
      selection.

      unless another Rule specifies a different method of or basis
      for ordering. For the first Round, this will be done instead in
      descending order of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings
      taken from the most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken
