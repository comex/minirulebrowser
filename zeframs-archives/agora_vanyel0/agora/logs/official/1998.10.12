I'm taking your word for it; I can't find any traffic relating to the 
Registrar Election called by previous Speaker Murphy on Sept 24
except for your own note in the latest Reg's Report mentioning
it, so I'm assuming the Nomination period just timed out without
any candidates.

I hereby initiate an Election for the Office of Registrar, Nomination
Period starting as of this message and to last for one Nomic Week,
Nominations to be sent to myself directly or to the Public Forum.
