81. Proposal by Steve, AI=3
Clearing the Ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
may not deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any
      other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.


Be it further resolved that R113 (Players may always opt out) be amended
by replacing the phrase "A Player" with the phrase "A Player other than
the Speaker".

[Since the Proposal has an AI of 3 anyway, I've taken the opportunity to
iron out some of the wrinkles in the Rules about the Speaker and
deregistration. At present, the wise policy of preventing the Speaker
from deregistering is enforced indirectly by R103, and only then because
that Rule takes precedence over R113 in case of a conflict, which there
would be if the Speaker ever tried to claim eir right to deregister
under R113.]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

66. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

75. Proposal by Steve, AI=2
Vlad the Historian

In recognition and appreciation of his masterful research into early
Agoran history, be it hereby resolved that the Agoran community bestow
upon Vlad, aka Scott de Brestian, the Unique Patent Title of Historian.

Be it further resolved that Vlad be awarded the Degree of Doctor of
Nomic History for his Thesis, published in two parts, entitled
'Prolegomena to the Study of Early Agoran History'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

77. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Modes of Voting

Amend Rule 1764 (Public Voting) to read:

  (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Proposals, Elections
      and Referenda: Public, Private and Unrestricted. The prevailing
      mode for each of each of Proposals, Elections and Referenda is 
      initially Public.

  (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
           for Proposals, with Support. 

       (2) The Registrar may change the prevailing mode of
           voting for Elections, with Support. 

       (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

  (c) When the Voting Period on a Proposal, Election or Referendum
      begins, the mode of voting for that Proposal, Election or 
      Referendum is set to the prevailing mode for that kind of vote.
      Once set in this manner, the mode of voting cannot be changed.

  (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message to the Public Forum.

       (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule to the 
           contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, or the 
           declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that Proposal, 
           Election or Referendum, may only be achieved by sending a 
           message privately to the Vote Collector.

       (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other Rule 
           to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes, 
           or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities on that 
           Proposal, Election or Referendum, may be achieved by sending
           a message either publically or privately.

Change the title of Rule 1764 to "Modes of Voting".

[v1.0 - Allows for a little bit of experimentation with different
        voting models without repeated proposals changing from one
        to another. Gives the Assessor and the Registrar some
        relatively innocuous discretionary powers with which to lure 
        the voters.

 v1.1 - Modified it to use the new "With Support" rule. Removed the
        clause describing timing, as that is covered by "With Support"
        (albeit in a different way).

        I am in the process of bringing the numbering in line with
        Gen Chaos' standard, but I've lost the message in which he
        described it. 

        Removed the final clause as it didn't seem to have any real
        purpose.

78. Proposal by Michael, AI=1
(no title)

That Rule 1854 ("The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary") be
amended to read:

The Chancellor can set the Basic Officer Salary by first announcing
that e is doing so in the Public Forum, provided that e announces a
value between 0 VTs and 8 VTs inclusive.  The change to the Basic
Officer Salary then occurs at the beginning of the next week if the
announcement was made on a Thursday or earlier in the week.  If the
announcement is made later in the week, then the change occurs at the
start of the second week after the announcement.

67. Proposal by Blob, AI=1
Auctions

Create a rule, with title "Default Procedure for Auctions", and text:

      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following standard Auction procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is the Entity responsible for
      collecting bids and announcing the result of the Auction.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
      On Hold status is measured at the time a Player sends eir
      Bid.

      Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one particular
      currency. Unless otherwise specified, the Auction Currency is
      the Voting Token.

      Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that an Auction is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Auctioneer, the
      Auction Currency, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
      value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Stating Bid
      is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
      during the Auction. A Bid is a message, sent to the Public
      Forum, announcing that the sender is bidding in that
      particular Auction, and the amount of eir Bid. A Bid is only
      valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the
              Auction, or after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.
          (4) The Bid is larger than any other valid Bid made
              so far in the Auction.

      End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
      there have been no Bids made. The Auction ends, and has no
      winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 24 hours has passed
      without a valid Bid having been made.

      The Winner: When the Auction ends, the Bidder who made the
      largest valid Bid in the Auction is the Winner. The
      Auctioneer shall announce the Winner of the Auction as soon
      as possible after the end of the Auction, and shall issue
      a Payment Order from the Winner to the Bank, for an amount
      equal to the size of the winning Bid.

Create a rule, with title "Private Auctions", and text:

      If an Auction is designated by the rules as being Private,
      then Bids may only made by sending them privately to the
      Auctioneer. This rule takes precedence over the standard
      Auction procedure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

71. Proposal by The Repeal-O-Matic, AI=1
Repeal Rule 1697 (Multiple rapid wins prohibited)

          Rule 1697 is hereby Repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

72. Proposal by Andre, AI=1
CotC? Who's the CotC?

Let Rule 889 be amended by adding the line
"The term 'CotC' shall unambiguously refer to the Clerk of the Courts."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

76. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Let the Promotor Exercise Judgment

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

82. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Simplify Probate

Be it therefore resolved, that Rules 1637, 1738, 1739 and 1757 be
repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      (a) An entity is inanimate if it:
        (1) possesses any number of units of Currency, and
        (2) does not have an Executor.

      (b) The Notary may perform any of the following with respect to
          a inanimate entity:
        (1) transfer Currencies owned by the inanimate entity for the
            purpose of satisfying a Payment Order naming the inanimate
            entity as payor;
        (2) Without Objection, vacate any Payment Order naming the
            inanimate entity as payor or payee; or
        (3) Without Objection, transfer Currencies owned by that
            entity to the Bank.

      (c) The Notary is authorized, all other Rules notwithstanding,
          to transfer Currency from any inanimate entity to any other
          entity as if e were the inanimate entity's Executor, when e
          is permitted to do so in accordance with subdivision (b) of
          this Rule.

      (d) A inanimate entity is considered to continue to have legal
          existence as long as it continues to possess units of
          Currency, even if it is dissolved, destroyed, or otherwise
          would cease to have legal existence prior to that time.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

83. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Keep Conway Out Of The Clock

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1527 be amended to read:

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, and the relative order of those communications is
      legally relevant, those communications shall be considered to
      have been sent in the order in which they appear in that
      message.  All such communications are considered to have been
      sent at the same time, however.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

84. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Broaden Actions Without Objection

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1728 be amended to read:

      (a) When the Rules specify that an action may be performed
          "Without N Objections", where N is an integer between one
          and five inclusive, that action may be legally performed
          under the following conditions:
        (1) The Player who seeks to perform the action has announced
            eir intent to perform that action not fewer than four days
            before, nor more than fourteen days before, the
            performance of the action, and this announcement must
            unambiguously describe the action to be performed;
        (2) The action performed must match exactly the action
            described in the announcement made under subdivision
            (a)(1) of this Rule;
        (3) The Rule which authorizes the performance of that action
            Without N Objections must explicitly state which Player or
            Players are authorized to perform that action; and
        (4) During the time between the announcement made under
            subdivision (a)(1) of this Rule and the performance of the
            action itself, fewer than N Players have posted, in the
            Public Forum, Objections to the performance of that
            action.

      (b) If the action to be performed is the change of some property
          under that Player's control, the change may not take place
          until the Player announces that e is making that change. 
          (This requirement is met by making any announcement normally
          required by the Rules in order to make such changes.)

      (c) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without Objection" is equivalent to specifying
          that it may be performed "Without 1 Objection".

      (d) The specification in the Rules that an action may be
          performed "Without N Objections" in no way prohibits
          performing that same action if doing so would be otherwise
          permissible.

      (e) A Rule may specify further restrictions upon the performance
          of an action Without N Objections, and this Rule defers to
          such Rules.

======================================================================

Proposal 3829 (Steve) AI = 3
Clearing the Ground

[Comment: I very much want to employ a distinction between Legislators
and Voters in my forthcoming Separation of Powers proto. But there's a
snag: the term "Voters" is already used in Rules 103, 112 and 1043, with
the meaning "Players other than the Speaker" - an archaism left over
from the long distant days when the Speaker was not allowed to vote.
So, to clear away the terminological ground for A Separation of Powers,
I make the following Proposal.]

This Proposal shall have an Adoption Index of 3.

Be it hereby resolved that R103 have its Title changed to "The Speaker
may not deregister", and that it be amended to read:

      At any time, there is exactly one Player who is the Speaker. The
      Speaker may not deregister or be deregistered for any reason, any
      other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.


Be it further resolved that R113 (Players may always opt out) be amended
by replacing the phrase "A Player" with the phrase "A Player other than
the Speaker".

[Since the Proposal has an AI of 3 anyway, I've taken the opportunity to
iron out some of the wrinkles in the Rules about the Speaker and
deregistration. At present, the wise policy of preventing the Speaker
from deregistering is enforced indirectly by R103, and only then because
that Rule takes precedence over R113 in case of a conflict, which there
would be if the Speaker ever tried to claim eir right to deregister
under R113.]

Be it further resolved that R112 be amended by deleting from it the
paragraph which reads:

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

[This provision was inserted over 3 years ago, when winning still
triggered a Speaker transition. With regular quarterly Speaker
Transitions now in place, we can get rid of it.]

Be it further resolved that R1043 (Deregistration) be amended to read:

      A Player other than the Speaker may deregister from Agora by
      sending a message to the Public Forum announcing eir
      deregistration. A Player who deregisters in this fashion ceases to
      be a Player effective at the time date-stamped on that message,
      and any attempts by em to reregister before thirty days have
      passed are without effect. This Rule takes precedence over Rules
      which would cause em to be reregistered before thirty days have
      passed after eir deregistration.

[I've made another slight change here: "before thirty days have passed"
has replaced "before the beginning of the next month". I cannot see why
a player who deregisters voluntarily near the end of a month should be
treated any differently from one who does so near the beginning.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3830 (Blob) AI = 1
Actions With N Supporters

Create a rule, with title "Actions With N Supporters", and text:

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made With N
      Supporters, where N is an integer between one and five
      inclusive, specifying how many supporters are necessary to
      allow the change to take place. Only those changes explicitly
      allowed by other Rules may be so made, and in order for such
      a change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change. If such a Rule does not specify a value for N
      between one and five, the value of N is one. For brevity's
      sake, the term "With Support" shall be taken as meaning
      "With one Supporter".

      In order to make a change With N Supporters, a Player
      authorized to make a given change With N Supporters must
      first post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made. The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change With
      N Supporters (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:

      (a) the post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
          days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
          announcing the intent to make the change;

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the
          Public Forum supporting the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made With Supporters.

That's my business as Registrar... Sorry, I had not fully realized that
we were in 1999 already, and so I somehow read your deregistration date
