  Judgement published:                     as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The first submission of the proposal failed because the email with the
proposal did not reach the public forum, it seems.

Now Morendil and Scott argue that Morendil effectively submitted the
proposal when e later sent a mail to the PF (successfully) that quoted
the full text of the original mail in which Morendil had tried to (but
failed) to submit the proposal. This second mail, quoting the first,
is seen as a valid submission.

I disagree, and don't think that Morendil's (re-)post of the proposal
was a submission. The repost contained the text of the proposal marked
clearly as a quotation of an earlier email document, and the intent of
the repost containing the proposal text was to provide evidence that
the proposal had already been properly submitted earlier. So I do not
think the text reposted by Morendil was delivered "with the clear
indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal", and
therefore it was not a proposal as defined in R1483.

==========================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I hereby return a Judgement of TRUE.

In my opinion, Morendil's quoting of the message by which he attempted
to submit the Proposal does not constitute a Proposal.  The text was
clearly quoted for purposes of making clear what message he was
referring to as having not made it to the PF.  Thus it fails to meet the
requirements of R1483 as there was no "clear indication that that text
is intended to become a Proposal."

----- 2. Rule 1483/4

Rule 1483/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Public Forum with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

  Assigned to Blob:                          as of this message

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Firstly the Vote Collector of these Proposals received my declaration
through the discussion forum.  Thus satisfying rule 1715.  However rule
1764 states that,

"Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
sending a message to the Public Forum."

And by this rule 1764 would take precedence over rule 1715.  Only for
reasons of if the vote was valid by who it was received by.  However I
believe that rule 1764 by the virtue of allowing or disallowing votes,
changes whether or not a proposal has met Quorum.

Now rule 1715 also states that,

"This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
Quorum."

And so by this rule 1717 takes precedence over rule 1764, causing a
contradiction.

Now considering Rule 1030

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

In this case I believe the last paragraph comes into force, and so rule
1715 takes precedence over rule 1764 for all contradictions between the
two rules.  In particular a declaration of presence is valid if sent to
the collector of votes for a given proposal, and so does not necessarily
have to be sent to a public forum.

Secondly,  if for whatever reason the argument  above does not hold,
making declaration valid only if sent to a public forum.  I believe that
my message did satisfy being sent to a public forum.  For the following
reasons


Rule 478 states

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

I believe that my declaration was sent to every active player, and also 
that this is verifiable.  Also as (for the reasons of the above argument 
failing) such a message has to be sent to a public forum to be valid.  
This would give a clear indication that it was indeed intended for a 
public forum.  

Further evidence also suggests that people though the message was 
intended for a public forum.  People not realizing themselves that it 
had been sent to public forum told me that the message should be posted 
to a public forum.   Surely they would not tell me to send the message 
to a public forum, if it was not clear to them that it was intended to 
be sent to a public forum.

Also note that nearly all declarations such as the one I sent arrive at 
a public forum (sooner or later).  This would also suggest that my 
message was intended for a public forum.

  the recent Proposals 3825 and 3826, was valid at that time.

==========================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Firstly the Vote Collector of these Proposals received my declaration
through the discussion forum.  Thus satisfying rule 1715.  However rule
1764 states that,

"Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
sending a message to the Public Forum."

And by this rule 1764 would take precedence over rule 1715.  Only for
reasons of if the vote was valid by who it was received by.  However I
believe that rule 1764 by the virtue of allowing or disallowing votes,
changes whether or not a proposal has met Quorum.

Now rule 1715 also states that,

"This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
Quorum."

And so by this rule 1717 takes precedence over rule 1764, causing a
contradiction.

Now considering Rule 1030

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

In this case I believe the last paragraph comes into force, and so rule
1715 takes precedence over rule 1764 for all contradictions between the
two rules.  In particular a declaration of presence is valid if sent to
the collector of votes for a given proposal, and so does not necessarily
have to be sent to a public forum.

Secondly,  if for whatever reason the argument  above does not hold,
making declaration valid only if sent to a public forum.  I believe that
my message did satisfy being sent to a public forum.  For the following
reasons


Rule 478 states

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

I believe that my declaration was sent to every active player, and also 
that this is verifiable.  Also as (for the reasons of the above argument 
failing) such a message has to be sent to a public forum to be valid.  
This would give a clear indication that it was indeed intended for a 
public forum.  

Further evidence also suggests that people though the message was 
intended for a public forum.  People not realizing themselves that it 
had been sent to public forum told me that the message should be posted 
to a public forum.   Surely they would not tell me to send the message 
to a public forum, if it was not clear to them that it was intended to 
be sent to a public forum.

Also note that nearly all declarations such as the one I sent arrive at 
a public forum (sooner or later).  This would also suggest that my 
message was intended for a public forum.
