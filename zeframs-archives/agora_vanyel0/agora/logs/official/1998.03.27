=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1090

   No Proposal entitled "The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal" has been
   distributed.


======================================================================

Judge:       Michael
Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, Harlequin,
             Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Oerjan, Steve,
             Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Murphy
Barred:
On request:
On hold:     General Chaos, Sherlock


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Murphy, 18 Mar 1998 01:50:52 -0800
  Assigned to Michael, 19 Mar 1998 11:34:04 +0000
  Judged TRUE, 26 Mar 1998 09:26:50 +0000

======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo not
present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims that,
therefore, the text in Blob's message was not a Proposal at all; in
particular, that Blob had not implicitly submitted that text as a Proposal

======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments:

The definition of Proposal is in Rule 1483, power = 1.

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

The issue of contention in the statement of the CFJ comes about
because a piece of text presumed to have been a Proposal was
distributed by Promotor Blob at time Wed, 4 Mar 1998 13:14:12 +1100
(EST), in an e-mail message with ID:
   <980304021412.8886@cse.unsw.edu.au>.

However, the text distributed as Proposal 3710 included the following:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal numberat time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a
      loophole in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

I shall now argue that this paragraph was not present in any
collection of text delivered to the Promotor with the clear indication
that this text was intended to become a Proposal.

Who might have delivered such a text?  Swann certainly did not deliver
this text to Blob.  He did deliver a similar text, but it was
sufficiently different not to be legally the same.  (The only rules
allowing for different texts to be considered legally same are R754,
which talks only of differences of spelling, grammar and dialect, and
R1339 which talks of variation of white-space and capitalisation in
rule change specifications.)

Could Blob have delivered the text to himself in such a way as to
satisfy the conditions in R1483?  This is a more interesting question.
However, I do not believe that this could have happened for two
reasons:

i)  We have no evidence to suggest that Blob at any stage initiated
    the delivery of the text in question, except possibly when he
    distributed the text in the message referred to above.  We rule
    out this latter possibility, because as is clear from the
    reactions of the Players of Agora (who voted on the putative
    Proposal), there was no clear indication that this text was
    intended to become a Proposal.  Rather the distribution of this
    text (including its delivery to Blob via the Public Forum)
    convinced everyone that a real Proposal was before them and had
    been distributed.

ii) Even if Blob did manage to somehow deliver the text to himself
    prior to his ditribution of it to the Public Forum, his subsequent
    behaviour again suggests that there was no clear indication
    attached to the text that this was intended to become a Proposal.
    If there had been such an indication with the text, then he would
    not have distributed it under Swann's name, and would not have
    attributed it an Urgency that it did not have.

As the text distributed in the message referred to above is the only
possible instance of a Proposal being distributed with the name in
question, and as I have ruled out this possibility, I conclude that
the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.

H. CotC,

I've lost track of the timing of the present appeals. Is there a
chance that the appeal results for CFJ1090 are published before I have
to deliver judgement on CFJ1089? In this case, I'd like to wait and
see what the appeals board says.

It would be a funny paradox to see CFJ1089 judged false while the
judgement of true on CFJ1090 is upheld...

I order the Bank to pay Kolja A. 1 VT for this judgement.
I order that Kolja A. gains 3 points.  -- elJefe, CotC

=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1089

  The Proposal submitted by Swann and entitled "The Great Officer's Veto
  Scam Proposal" has not been distributed.


======================================================================

Judge:       Kolja A.
Judgement:   TRUE

Eligible:    Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, Harlequin,
             Jester, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Oerjan, Steve,
             Swann

Ineligible:  Time Agent (defaulted)
Caller:      Murphy
Barred:
On request:
On hold:     General Chaos, Sherlock


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Murphy, 18 Mar 1998 01:50:52 -0800
  Assigned to Time Agent, 19 Mar 1998 11:34:03 +0000
  Re-assigned to Kolja A., 27 Mar 1998 11:36:08 +0000
  Judged TRUE, 27 Mar 1998 17:02:34 +0100


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo not
present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims that,
therefore, Swann's Proposal was not distributed.


======================================================================
Judge's Reasons and Arguments:

Rule 1483/3 (Definition of Proposals) reads, in part,

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

Based on this definition and the publically known facts, it is clear
that the proposal ("collection of text, delivered to the promotor with
the clear indication etc..") referred to in the statement for this
judgement was created, and exists.

This proposal was then given a number and placed in the proposal queue
(even if its text was not rendered correctly in the inofficial part of
the document in which the Promotor published the proposal queue at the
time). For the number note that at the time in question R109 was still
in the old form 109/2, which assigned proposal numbers at the time of
submission, not distribution. For the text note that R1036 states that
"The actual text of the Proposals in the Queue need not be published."
Therefore, the proposal queue did contain the proposal.

However, while the text of a proposal or its scrambled rendition in
the publication of the Proposal Queue has no legal significance for
the state of the proposal queue, R1770 (Distributing Proposals)
requires that "Proposals" be distributed, i.e. the body of text that
consitutes the proposal.

In the case of P3710, this didn't happen, and the difference between
the distributed body of text and the true proposal 3710 is not
insignificant. The only rules that deny minor differences between
texts any significance are Rule 754/3 (Spelling and Grammar Errors)
and Rule 1339/6 (Precision in Rule Changes) which allow "Differences
in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the substitution of a word or
phrase by a synonym or abbreviation [...] as long as there is no
ambiguity in meaning" resp. "Variations in whitespace or
capitalization in the quotation of text in an existing Rule to be
removed or replaced". However, the differing parts of P3710 and the
distributed text were "Proposal <proposal number> at time" and
"Proposal <proposal numberat time", and do not contain a difference
covered by the quoted rules.

Therefore the text distributed by the Promotor was not the Proposal
submitted by Swann and entitled "The Great Officer's Veto Scam
Proposal", and the statement for this judgement is true.

Although it isn't strictly relevant to this statement for judgement, I
would like to add that the above arguments imply that the text
distributed wasn't proposal 3710, either. According to this
interpretation, P3710 is still in the proposal queue; the Promotor
broke the rules governing the distribution of proposals because e did
not yet distribute it, and, in addition, published wrong proposal
queue listings. Additionally, one might argue that the votes that
players and other voting entities tried to cast on P3710 were cast
before the voting period on this proposal began and were thus illegal
according to Rule 683/5 (Legal Votes). They should also not have led
to POs according to 1442. The attempt to make the proposal a Senate
Proposal was ineffective for the same reason.
