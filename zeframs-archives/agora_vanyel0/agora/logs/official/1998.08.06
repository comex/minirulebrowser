I rolled a nine-sided dice this time, and still got a six.  

The relevant section of the case-sheet now reads: 

> Eligible: Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, General Chaos, Harlequin,
>           lee, Macross, Murphy
> (Rolled a six on 0-8 sided dice: selection is lee)

lee you can consider yourself selected as of this message though; so
you get an extra day to consider if you really want it. 

Michael.
