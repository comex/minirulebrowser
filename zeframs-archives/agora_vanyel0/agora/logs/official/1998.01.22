Hi all, 

There is a new proposal for Internomic. It reads:

>>
Title: Gone Dotty
Proposal: Amend Rule 215 by replacing the text "Ackanomic," with the
text "Ackanomic, .Nomic,"
<<

It was submitted by Ackanomic and has the beautiful number 360. 

The voting period for the Agora referendum on this lasts until Wed, 28
Jan 1998 22:26:55 -0500. 

Let me remind our new players that voting in this referendum is
governed by rules 1434 and 1632, and is completely _free_. The purpose
of the proposal is to make .Nomic a voting member of Internomic (IN
has a rule that lists all voting members, IN 215.)

Four your information, .Nomic is a new nomic that is partly played via
email and partly via the USENET-newsgroup alt.games.nomic, which was
created for this purpose ages ago but never really got going until
very recently. 

I found the correpsonding web site yesterday - until then, there were
more than 20 propsals, but all so new that none had been adopted
yet. The initial rule set looked very similar to our initial rules, at
least at first glance. 

If you have web access, the site is
