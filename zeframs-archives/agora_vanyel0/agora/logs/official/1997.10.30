* Proposal 349 (Voting in Agora lasts until Sat 01 Nov 1997 10:26:50
-0400)

Ammend R215 by replacing the string "Rishonomic" with the string "New
Rishonnomic"

* On the IN mailing list there is a (slow) discussion about something
which appears to me to be a more fuzzy and unclear variant of the
"fork" proto that recently appeared here in Agora.

                               CFJ 1061
   Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
 installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
 Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
 the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

======================================================================

Judge:       Steve

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
	     General Chaos, Harlequin, Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, 
	     Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad

Not eligible:
Caller:	     Morendil (not a player)
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     
Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686
Requested Injunction: see Arguments

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Morendil, 29 Oct 1997 17:11:54 +0100
  Assigned to Steve, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

  Blob defaults
  Assigned to Oerjan, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

I vote to overturn and find the Statement FALSE.  My reasons are
the same as I offered in a previous decision.

Justice Andre made much of the fact that General Chaos had interpreted
the TO in question as a single one for 4 TVs as opposed to 2 TOs for 2 VTs
each.  I cannot find any reason why the latter interpretation is
unambiguously specified by the message, since neither one was
a performable Transfer Order at the time.  Further, I interpret
Morendil's COE as referring to the statement that the PO was not satisfied.

The Statement in question does not say that Gen. Chaos committed an
error in presenting the game state.  It refers specifically to COE's,
and while the General may have made an error in interpreting and
reporting, e did not err in denying the COE. Nor is any other evidence
in sight that e has committed wrongful COE denial in the past.

I formally dispute this interpretation. Rule 1585 was specifically 
designed to deal with that situation.

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

I hereby Call for Judgement on the following Statement :

  Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

Relevant Rules : 1585, 1686

R&A :

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

Of course not. We who share your views have all left, under simililarly
unhappy circumstances.

Congratulations for explaining yourself so clearly. Your message fit my
sentinments almost exactly. 

And reminded me that, occasional sentimental remembrances notwithstanding,
returning to Agora as it exists would be, for me, a complete waste of time.

                               CFJ 1059

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.

  Judged TRUE by elJefe, 26 Oct 1997 21:06:28 +0000

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Unfortunately, I can't think of any better argument at the moment
other than "intention".  Clearly R1714 was intended to make the reporting of
Lawlessness optional (and slightly dangerous).  Scott's interpretation makes
the reporting of Lawlessness mandatory and opens the Herald up to being
prosecuted for a Class A crime if e makes a mistake in reporting someone's
Blots while having no intention of alleging Lawlessness.

Hmm, this gives me an idea for another argument.  To "allege" something
requires intent on the part of the alleger.  The fact that the commission of a
crime can be inferred from someone's statement of fact does not mean that
someone has alleged that a crime has been committed.  Simply reporting a number
of Blots does not clearly identify the Herald's intentions wrt Lawlessness and
therefore cannot be considered equivalent to an explicit declaration that a
Player is Lawless.

Relevant Rules: 1714

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement:  TRUE

I judge the Statement to be TRUE.  Rule 1714's second paragraph reads:

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

"Allege" is not defined in the Rules, and its ordinary meaning of "declare
to be true" controls.  To say whether something is "alleged" by a statement
will depend not only on the meanings of the constituent words but on their
form.  Synonymous forms may yield a sentence with the same truth value but
one which differs in what it alleges.

As an extreme example, suppose that Lawlesness were a more complicated
condition, with Rule A saying that someone with over 30 Blots is Lawless,
and higher-precedence Rules X, Y, and Z  saying that someone in the Grace
Period or the Champion's Reward period or with the status of Shogun is not
Lawless after all.  Then an announcement that a player has 37 Blots is not
an allegation of Lawlessness.  Too much information is left out.

In the case that inspired the CFJ, a Herald's report of some number (37?)
of Blots is not a synonym of Lawlessness even in our simpler world.  That
too would not be an allegation of Lawlessness.

In essence, in the situation of the Statement, a reasonable person should
be able to tell from the communication itself that it is saying that the
player is lawless, or in the state of lawlessness, without referring to the
Rules.

"Player X has more than 30 Blots" does not quite qualify.  We need to see
"Player X is Lawless" or some other form of words which on its face means
the same thing.

Regards,
-- elJefe, Judge

======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals (unofficial)
======================================================================

Proposal 3569 (Zefram)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Currencies 

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") be amended
to read

      Proposal Notes (P-Notes) are a Currency.  The MUQ of P-Notes is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for P-Notes is the Promotor.  The Mintor of
      P-Notes is the Bank.

      The Promotor's Report includes the number of P-Notes possessed by
      each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Promotor's Report.

      Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

{Modelled after R1696.  The change in the final paragraph removes a bug:
the previous version could be read as obliging the Promotor to pay out
P-Notes an infinite number of times.}

Be it further resolved that Rule 1435 ("Definition of Indulgences,
Blots and Immaculate") be amended to read

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof since
      the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule states
      that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment Order shall
      be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank as the payee,
      and for a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots that
      Player is to receive.  This order is to be executed by whomever
      is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Be it further resolved that a Rule be created, with Title "Blot Amnesty",
reading

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the Herald shall report, as soon
      as possible, all Infractions of Persistent Indebtedness that have
      been committed and not previously reported.  When e has done so,
      e is then authorised and obliged to, as soon as possible, vacate
      all unsatisifed Payment Orders for Indulgences.  Immediately after
      e has done so, this Rule repeals itself.

{Complete amnesty -- the only solution that will really work.}
 
======================================================================

Proposal 3571 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Create a Rule with this text:

     October 16, 1997, shall be known as Lost In Space Day.

[Comments:  What the hell.]

 ======================================================================

Proposal 3572 (Steve)  AI = 3  (Disinterested)
Prohibit Retroactivity

[Comment: Rule 108 has turned out to be a lot weaker than we
thought. This proposal will give it back some teeth. Thanks go
to Chuck for the wording.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 108 be amended to read:

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 108 are Peter Suber,
Steve and Chuck.

======================================================================

Proposal 3573 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Majority Appeal decisions

[Comment: in a couple of CFJs recently, we have seen a majority of
the Justices agree to overturn a decision - only to have the CFJ
then reassigned because of the way R1693 is worded. I propose to
fix this problem. In general, I have tried to make clearer the
relationship between the rulings of individual Justices and the
Board's ruling.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1693 be amended to read:

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices 
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above. 

======================================================================

Proposal 3574 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Judicial Cleanup

1. Amend 1563 by replacing the second paragraph with

If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other rules it
lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

2. Cosmetic changes: 

Amend 1565 by

replacing the string "when only when" in the third paragraph by "only
when".

And in the last paragraph relacing "a Judicial Salary of 3 Mil" by "a
Judicial Salary of 1 VT".
---

[Note that the last change will simply be ineffective if Scott's
proposal is accepted.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3575 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Internomic referenda

Amend 1632 by adding the following sentence to the third paragraph
(Duration of Voting):

If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than three days, the
Voting Period shall instead last for three days or until two days
before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant InterNomic
Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.
---

[Note that, if this still does not lead to a voting period of a
positive length, the Ambassador has clearly failed to distribute the
proposal ASAP, according to 1632.]
