Registrar and Assessor Michael does not receive his salaries for this
period because he failed to produce a report in these roles.

However, I believe that there are probably no additional penalties to
be imposed for this failing as the relevant rule defining what these
are is without effect.  (Oh the irony :-)

Michael.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

OFF:  New Proposals: 3656-3658

I stand by my contention that the ROM posting I made was clearly labeled as an
informational message, i.e. that the text was *not* labeled as text that was
intended to become proposals, but rather as text that was *already* "submitted"
as proposals.  It turned out that this information was incorrect except for the
last two proposals described in the message.  Therefore,...

There are three new proposals distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
s = Sane
E = Emergency
 
D  3656 Repeal-O-Matic 1 Repeal Rule 1494
D  3657 Repeal-O-Matic 1 Repeal Rule 1741
   3658 Steve          1 Bring Back Public Voting

======================================================================
Proposal 3656 (Repeal-O-Matic)  AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1494

Rule 1494 is hereby repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3657 (Repeal-O-Matic)  AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1741

Rule 1741 is hereby repealed.

======================================================================
Proposal 3658 (Steve)  AI = 1
Bring Back Public Voting

[Comment: the Public Voting Experiment seems to have been popular,
but the renumbering of the Rule which brought it into being means
that it will end on Dec 23, since P3634 no longer amends the correct
Rule. I propose to bring it back quickly.]

[Comment: P3651 has the same problem as P3634, I've incorporated its
amendment into the proto.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Public Voting", be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Texts of Adopted Proposals between 3601 and 3623 omitted.

======================================================================

Proposal 3627 (General Chaos)  AI = 2  (Disinterested)
Pragmatization of Transfer Orders

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended by appending the
following paragraph:

      The determination, for the purpose of this Rule, of whether an
      entity has sufficient Currency to execute a transfer shall be
      made based on the Recordkeepor's records at the time the
      transfer is executed.  A Recordkeepor's good faith determination
      that a transfer has succeeded or failed is definitive, even if
      it is based on erroneous information.

[Believe it or not, this single change is sufficient to eliminate
 almost all indeterminancy regarding the interplay of Currency
 Holdings upon other events.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3629 (General Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Persistent Judges

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 951 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      randomly select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This
      selection shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
      to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.  

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 408 be amended to read:

      The Judge of an open CFJ is required to, within seven days of
      when that CFJ last became open or seven days of eir assignment
      to that CFJ, whichever is later, close that CFJ by dismissing or
      judging the CFJ and/or granting or denying any outstanding
      judicial motions pertaining to that CFJ.  Other Rules may
      prescribe a different time limit or establish procedures by
      which this time limit may be extended or shortened, and this
      Rule defers to them.

      The failure of a Judge to close a case within the prescribed
      time constitutes the Infraction of Judicial Tardiness and
      carries a penalty of one Blot for each day (or fraction thereof)
      that the case remains open beyond the permitted time.  This
      penalty is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

      The failure to observe this time limit does not, by itself,
      cause the delinquent Judge to be recused from the CFJ, nor does
      it invalidate eir judgment or dismissal of the CFJ or grant or
      denial of any related judicial motion which that Judge might
      submit after the limit has expired.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 591 be amended to read:

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT for judging a
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1567 be amended to read:

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge of that
      CFJ.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

======================================================================

Proposal 3633 (Chuck)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Rule Attributions 

Rule 1667 ("Origination of Rules") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1668 ("Authorship of Rules") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1669 ("Rule Attributions") is hereby repealed.

Rule 1681 ("The Logical Rulesets") is hereby amended by
deleting the line which reads

        * The Attribution of each Rule

[Comment: I see little or no benefit to these.  Note that I am
not proposing to amend R1430, which will continue to require the
Rulekeepor to note the proposer of each proposed Rule Change in
the historical annotations.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3634 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Permanent Public Voting

Be it hereby resolved that R1741 be amended by deleting from it the text
which reads:

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

======================================================================

Proposal 3635 (General Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Simplify Judicial Salaries

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 502 be amended to read:

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

[Simplifies matters considerably.  The "within one week" is used
 instead of ASAP to allow the CotC to batch salary payments together
 instead of having to do them in strict ASAP order.]

Proposal 3636 (General Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Probate, Take Two 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1601 be amended to read:

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.
 
      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1745 be repealed.

[An entity possessing stranded Currencies is placed in Probate
 instead.]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1738 be amended to read:

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

Be it further resolved, that the following Rule be enacted:

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or 
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended to read:

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.  

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

Proposal 3637 (Blob)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.  

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

======================================================================

Proposal 3641 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Amend the rule created by Proposal 3612 (The Repeal-O-Matic II) by
inserting the following text as a new paragraph, after the string "and
[Power] is replaced by the Power of that same Rule.": 


    If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other rules or
    to concepts or entities that also appear in other rules, the
    promotor is authorized, but not obliged, to add provisions to the
    Proposal that leave the ruleset in a more consistent and functional 
    state after the repeal of the rule picked by the promotor.

======================================================================

Proposal 3642 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
No Double Penalties for Officers 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1007 be amended by deleting the
paragraph which begins "If the Rules pertaining...".

[It's truly unfair to Officers to both take away their Salaries _and_
whap them with an Infraction for the same thing.  Especially for the
Assessor, whose primary duty, tabulating Votes, does not yield a
document which must be published once each week.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3643 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Lowered Quorum

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 879 be amended, by replacing the
text "35% of all Players, or 50% of all the Players not On Hold" with
"one-third of Active Players, or one-fifth of all Players".

======================================================================

Proposal 3644 (G.Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Liberalize Speaker's Patronage 

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1661 be amended, by replacing "for
an amount not in excess of 1 VT" with "for not more than 1 unit of any
one Currency Minted by the Bank."

======================================================================

Proposal 3645 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Late Judgements

Amend Rule 408 to read:

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of infraction,
      if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the penalty is 1 VT
      and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even though delivered
      late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and the Judge becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge shall be assigned in
      the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is neither
      required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on, or
      dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to that CFJ
      at the moment e becomes ineligible.


Amend Rule 591 by deleting the sentence:

      A Judgement returned after the end of the permitted deliberation
      period, or by a Player ineligible to be Judge of that CFJ is not
      legal and shall not be accepted by the Clerk.

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1565 by deleting the text ", and only when issued by the Judge
within the permitted deliberation period"

and changing the last sentence to read

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.


Amend Rule 1447 by changing the last sentence to read

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their
      determinations.


{Comments:
1.) The CotC must accept late judgements, provided they reach the CotC
before e reports the Judge for failure to judge.

2.) Late Judgements are penalized (1 VT plus loss of Judicial salary).
However, Judges should not rest easy because the CotC may reassign a
late CFJ without warning, and then the penalty is 3 blots.

3.) The CotC has discretion on when to guillotine the lateness period,
but at most one week.

4.) Omit the troublesome phrase "prior to the end of the permitted
time", from Rule 408. }

======================================================================

Proposal 3646 (elJefe)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Organizational Payment Orders

Create a Rule "Organizational Payment Orders" which reads:

     The Executor of Organization's SLC is empowered to execute Payment
     Orders from the Organization or from any Player within its
     Jurisdiction, but only such Payment Orders as are authorized by the
     SLC.

{Comment:  The ability of Contests and Groups (old Rule 1534) to make
currency transfers from their contestants/members disappeared with
Pragmatic Currencies. Instead we merely have the SLC's power to require
Players to transfer currencies, which anyone can avoid by simply
resigning from the Contest or Group.  This proto restores the ability to
make the transfers happen regardless. }

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================

Only the four Proposals reported adopted for the first time in this
Report are listed below.  See the prior Report for the others.

======================================================================

Proposal 3628 (Murphy)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Nominations

Amend Rule 1558 by replacing this text:

      * No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
        the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

with this text:

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted Nomination,
        would not be permitted to hold the Office which the Election is
        seeking to fill.

======================================================================

Proposal 3631 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Left In A Huff!

Be it hereby resolved that Waggie, Gecko, Kelly, Swann, KoJen, Zefram
and Vlad be awarded the Patent Title of Left In A Huff.

======================================================================

Proposal 3638 (Michael)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal the Virus.

Be it hereby resolved that rule 1454 "The Virus" be repealed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ As I won't be paying a proposal fee for this proposal, it will
  likely be Disinterested as a result.  Basically I'm sick of the
  Virus. It's done enough damage now and demonstrated its potential
  for long enough.  I think we're more than capable of getting
  ourselves into messes without having to resort to a random number
  generator.

  When, for example, are we going to see Plots proposed?  The authors
  claim that things need to settle down before this happens.
  Personally, I can't see the point in waiting for quiescence ("STASIS
  means death!" as our friend Frankenstein might say), but perhaps
  repealing the Virus will help them get round to it. ]

======================================================================

Proposal 3647 (Swann)  AI = 1
Quorum Tools

Let the following rule be created;
{Title:Quorum Buyback}

     Any Player other than the Assessor is permitted to buyback Quorum 
     on a particular Proposal.  A Player is only permitted to do this
     once for any single Proposal. A Player does this by informing the 
     Assessor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a specified Proposal. 
     That Player can rescind eir buyback before the end of the voting 
     period by sending a message stating so to the Assessor.

     The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not rescinded) 
     is to reduce the Quorum on the specified Proposal by one.  If
     multiple Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal, the effect is 
     cumulative.

     At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor 
     shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for 
     each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Assessor shall then bill 
     each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

     The Assessor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a 
     Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

======================================================================
