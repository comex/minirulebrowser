I do not wish the Judicial system to seem in any way compromised during this
difficult period. Justice must not only be done, but be seen to be done.
I therefore resign as Clerk of the Courts, appointing Morendil as my
successor, if he will accept the position, which I hope he will. I will
accept without complaint whatever verdict the Courts feel it necessary
to bring against me. I trust I will be given a fair hearing.

I will talk to Geoff Wong, the system administrator for gecko, about
assuming my responsibilities as Distributor for a period. Registrar
Michael can make Geoff the Distributor if Geoff will agree to it.

Steve
