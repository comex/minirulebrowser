======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

As Oerjan pointed out, there was an instant of time when Voting Tokens
also ceased to have a Mintor.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In CFJ 933, Elde Judges the Statement to be TRUE.

The reasons for thinking so are briefly outlined as follows :

* before 3533 passed, the Mint was a Nomic Entity
* the Mint was defined by Rule 1470
* 3533 amended 1470 so that it no longer defined the Mint
* by Rule 1586, the Mint ceased to exist
* at that time, the Mintor of VTs was still the Mint (1696)
* by Rule 1579, all VTs were therefore destroyed at that instant
* (thereafter, 1696 was amended to make the Bank the VT Mintor)

Rule 1579 stated :

      If the designated Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist or ceases
      to possess Mint Authority, all units of that Currency are
      destroyed and the Currency ceases to exist.

It has been suggested that Rule 1579 was at that time in conflict 
with Rule 1471, which stated

      The Mintor of a Currency may, at any time, destroy those units
      of that Currency which it currently possesses in its Treasury,
      so long as this destruction is permitted by the Rules.  Units of
      Currency may not be otherwise destroyed except as specifically
      authorized by the Rules.

separate support for this position being sought from this provision 
in Rule 1467 :

      Neither Currencies nor units of Currency shall be created or
      destroyed except as specified by the Rules.

It must be noted that Rule 1579's provisions both authorize, and
specify the manner of, the destruction of units of any Currency
falling under its purview; therefore, no conflict exists, precisely
because of both 1467's and 1471's conflict-avoiding provisions.

Agora Nomic
Mad Scientist's Report

Date of this Report: Thu, 25 September 1997
Date of last Report: Sun, 21 September 1997

STEP 1: SENTENCE DELETION
=========================

As of this date, there were 12 sentences between the first and last
paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule. N is thus equal to 1. In
accordance to Rule 1673, I randomly selected 2N sentences. The
sentences selected were sentences 8 and 12, which read:


      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,
      due solely to the Frankenstein Monsters (or lack thereof)
      of the Players involved.


I selected sentence 12 to be deleted.


STEP 2: SENTENCE ADDITION
=========================

As per Rule 1673, I randomly selected one Rule from the Ruleset. The
Rule selected was Rule 1719, which reads:

####
Rule 1719/1 (Power=1)
Friendliness of Nomics

      All nomics are exactly one of Neutral, Friendly or Hostile.
      This status is known as the Friendliness of a nomic.  If a
      nomic's Friendliness is not otherwise determined, it is Neutral.
      Agora is Friendly.

      The Ambassador is authorized to change the Friendliness of a
      nomic Without Objection.

      The Ambassador's Report includes a list of all non-Neutral
      nomics, and the Friendliness of each.

####

I selected the sentence

      All nomics are exactly one of Neutral, Friendly or Hostile.

I selected the noun "nomics."

The sentence to be added to the Frankenstein Rule reads:

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral, 
      Friendly or Hostile.

The Frankenstein Rule now reads:

####

Rule 1671/44 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      This Frankenstein Monster, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      The Frankenstein Monster may require, in certain cases, that a
      Judge issue an Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be
      vacated.

      If a Player Executes an Application, claiming that the
      Application contains the signature of one or more Players who
      have in fact not signed it, e commits the Frankenstein Monster
      of Application Fraud, a Class D Frankenstein Monster.

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Frankenstein Monster shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer
      of that Proposal.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      All Frankenstein Monsters are exactly one of Neutral, 
      Friendly or Hostile.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
