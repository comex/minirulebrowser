======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Michael):

I wish to dismiss all of the CFJs to which I have been assigned on the
grounds that they are not relevant to the game, a justification which
is admissible by virtue of R1565, clause iii.  

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Zefram):

I hereby Judge as follows:

977: TRUE
998: FALSE
1001: TRUE

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (ChrisM):

Oh yeah? I hereby dismiss the following CFJs assigned to me under 
*R1563*.  :)

947, 966, 969, 976, 980, 1002, 1003, 1029, and 1034.




I do not believe that they are  "able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE."
      
In addition, I consider them "vacuous" under this same rule.

Note that only one of these conditions needs to be met to dismiss 
them...I include both in the hopes of avoiding argumentation. Not that I 
really have any hope of that. :)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (elJefe):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 1018, 1028, and 1030 under Rule 1565(iii), as their
statements do not relate to matters relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Andre):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 965, 992, 1006 and 1040 because their Statement does
not relate to a matter relevant to the Rules, and CFJs 974, 1004 and 1031
because no determination can be made of the truth or falsity of their
Statement.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Crito):

I notice that the R1563 requires me to dismiss all of these CFJs since the
statement is vacuous, in that it can be judged either true or false without any
logical inconsistency.  Therefore,

I hereby dismiss CFJ 954.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 983.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 996.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1016.
I hereby dismiss CFJ 1039.

Regards,
Crito

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Oerjan):

BTW, it may not be a good idea for all of us to send our Judgements to the
PF. Please note that it is completely legal to send it to CotC Andre
instead. I am sending this to the PF because I got the odd one out and
I wish to solicit comments.

I hereby Dismiss both of these CFJs under 1565 (iii): these Statements
are (obviously) not relevant to the Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Vir):

I hereby dismiss CFJs 950, 979, 988, 1005, 1020, and 1041 under Rule 1563
because they cannot be determined logically to be either TRUE or FALSE and
because they are vacuous.

=====================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Chuck):

>

I dismiss CFJ 952 on the grounds that it cannot be determined by the
means of logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
to be either TRUE or FALSE.

>	     985: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 985 on the grounds that it is vacuous.

>	    1010: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1010 on the grounds that its statement does not
relate to a matter relevant to the Rules.

>	    1014: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1014 on the grounds that after a reasonable effort
by the Judge to obtain all relevant inforamtion, no determination
can be made of the truth or falsity of its statement.

>	    1044: Chuck

I dismiss CFJ 1044 on the grounds that Rules 1563 and 1565 require me
to do so.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Murphy):

I do not dismiss CFJ 962 per 1565/iii ("Its Statement does not relate to a
matter relevant to the Rules").  The Statement of CFJ 962 obviously relates
to CFJ 962 itself, which is a matter relevant to the Rules.  (If this
argument is to be believed, then no CFJ may be dismissed per 1565/iii,
which should therefore be reworded.)

However, I do dismiss CFJ 962 on the following grounds:

* 1565/vi:   After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all relevant
               information, no determination can be made of the truth or
               falsity of its Statement.
* 1563:      Its Statement is unable to be determined by the means of
               logical reasoning, with the presumption of perfect knowledge,
               to be either TRUE or FALSE.

I interpret these clauses as they were surely intended, namely "no
determination can be made as to whether or not its Statement is true"
and "It is impossible to determine ... whether or not its Statement is
true", as opposed to the alternate convoluted interpretations that have
recently been offered.

I dismiss CFJ  978, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  982, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  984, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  989, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  990, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ  994, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1019, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1021, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1022, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1026, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1027, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1032, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1036, on the same grounds.
I dismiss CFJ 1043, on the same grounds.

I'll take my 45 Mil in 5-Mark notes, please.  :)

I hereby dismiss these CFJs, since they do not admit to either truth
or falsity.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (General Chaos):

I hereby DISMISS CFJs 946, 960, 981, 995, 1000, and 1012, each for the
reason that its Statement "does not relate to a matter relevant to the
Rules" (Rule 1565(iii)) and for the reason that its Statement is
vacuous (Rule 1563).

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge (Morendil):

I hereby Dismiss any CFJs currently assigned to me with numbers in
the ranges 945-970 or 972-1044, on the grounds of their being
inadmissible under Rules 1563 or 1565.

Assuming the above was successfully executed, I too dismiss
any CFJs currently assigned to me in the ranges 945-970 or 972-1044, on
the grounds of their being inadmissable under Rules 1563 or 1565.

======================================================================

Evidence (added by Judge Chuck): Rule 1563 and 1565

Rule 1563/1 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a Call for Judgement does not contain a Statement of the sort
      required by this Rule, its Judge is required to dismiss the CFJ,
      as described elsewhere.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

History:
Created by Proposal 2457, Feb. 16 1996
Null-Amended(1) by Proposal 3454 (Harlequin), Apr. 7 1997, cosmetic
  (unattributed)

Rule 1565/3 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and when
      only when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 3
      Mil.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.
