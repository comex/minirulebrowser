The Game of Agora
  This Category includes Rules applying to all aspects of this Nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

History:
Created by Proposal 913, date unknown
Transmuted from MI=1 to MI=Unanimity by Proposal 1020, Sep. 4 1994
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1484, Mar. 15 1995

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

[CFJ ???: "abide by all the Rules" means the Rules as a whole, not
 necessarily each individual Rule.
 CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.
 CFJ 825: Players would have to obey the Rules even if 101 were
 repealed.]

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 101, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1480, Mar. 15 1995

Originator: Peter Suber
Author: Peter Suber

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

History:
Initial Immutable Rule 116, Jun. 30 1993
Mutated from MI=Unanimity to MI=3 by Proposal 1483, Mar. 15 1995

Originator: Peter Suber
Author: Peter Suber

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/3 (Power=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

[CFJ 700: Neither nicknames nor Players are "created by the Nomic
 Rules, and exist only within the context of Agora Nomic."
 CFJs 815 & 816: If an amendment is made which changes the properties
 of an Entity, the Entity changes to conform to the new Rule, rather
 than the destruction of the old Entities.  If the old Entity has
 the same name as the new Entity, that implies continuity of that
 Entity if at all possible.]

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

Defense of Marriage Act

      Any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, no action
      which is legal or permitted by the Rules when attempted
      by one set of Players shall be illegal or forbidden by
      the Rules when attempted by a different set of Players,

      involved.

Rule 754/3 (Power=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

[CFJ 712: This includes referring to a Player by a method other than
 eir name or nickname, as long as it is unambiguous.
 CFJ 744: In the context of Rule Changes, text in an existing Rule
 must be quoted exactly in order to be unambiguous.]

Rule 795/2 (Power=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in any way for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a gain or loss of Kudos by any
      means shall not be construed as a punishment.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

Rule 1497/4 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Misrepresentation, a
      Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Crime of
      Falsification, a Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of evidence in a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement commits the Crime of Perjury, a Class B
      Crime.

      A Player shall never be convicted of more than one of the above
      Crimes for the same act.

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

Rule 1727/2 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

       "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
        may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
        invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
        published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
        convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official name of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than seven
      days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall announce
      Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      BIrth a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to each such
      Contest 5 VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of Appeals,
      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call
      For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge, Judgement,
      call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player Execute an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

Rule 1586/1 (Power=1)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define that entity, that entity
      ceases to exist, along with any properties it may have
      possessed.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

Rule 478/9 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      annoucing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules calls upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise

[CFJ 707: Something sent to the PF is effective at the moment it is
 received by the listserver.
 CFJ 752: Something sent to a Player who is obligated to send it to
 all Players is sufficient for sending something to the PF.
 CFJ 813: A Player need not prove that e can receive the PF.
 CFJ 831: The Date: header of a message is not necessarily the time
 at which the message takes effect.]

Rule 459/1 (Power=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
      automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,
      GMT, on the first of the month.  Any automatic change which must
      occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of
      each calendar quarter.

      This Rule defers to any Rule that defines another explicit
      schedule for events.  Any activity that must be performed at
      least weekly, monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in
      the given period.

Rule 1274/1 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

Power

      There shall exist a property of entities known as Power.  The
      Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      An "instrument" is any entity with Power greater than zero.

      The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is set
      to another value in accordance with the Rules.

Rule 1023/9 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      the Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

[CFJ 832: The dice-roll server at dice@danpost4.uni-c.dk meets these
 requirements.]

The Rules
  This Category includes Rules about the Rules.  (See also
  "Making Proposals" which includes some Rules concerning Rule
  Changes, even in the absence of Proposals;  See also "The
  Rulekeepor and Archivist" which includes Rules regulating
  the Logical Rulesets and Rule Titles)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 920, Apr. 17 1997: Rule 114 should be interpreted such that a
change to the rules such that they instantaneously thereafter do not
permit modification of the rules is not prevented from occurring by
Rule 114 if it leaves the gamestate such that after some definite
finite or infinitesemal time interval the rules will again change such
that the gamestate then satisfies Rule 114's condition.
Relevant Rules: 114

[CFJ 906: the term 'ruleset' as used within Rule 114 refers to a set
 of information that includes all Rules, and not merely to a
 representation of that information.]

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.  Such Entities shall have whatever
      power is granted to them by the Rules.  In the event that the
      requirements of such an Entity conflicts with the Rules, the
      Rules shall always take precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities which are
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity which was
      created first under the authority of that Rule takes precedence
      over the others.

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

Rule 1454/4 (Power=1)
The Virus

      There is a Nomic Entity called the Virus which has the effect
      of altering the texts of Rules, in the manner and under the
      conditions set out below. This process is known as "infection".
      The effect of the Virus on a Rule, when it has an effect, is
      that of a non-Proposed Amendment to that Rule. Thus, the Virus
      can only be effective inasmuch as it satisfies the Rules for
      the effectiveness of non-Proposed Rule Changes.

      The selection of the Rule to be infected by the Virus occurs as
      follows: as soon as possible after the beginning of each Nomic
      Week, the Rulekeepor shall select a random integer in the range
      [M,N], where M and N are, respectively, the numbers of the
      lowest and highest numbered Rules at the beginning of that
      week. Call a number selected in this way a Virus Number.  If
      the Virus Number selected is the number of a Rule, then that
      Rule is infected as described below, and no further Virus
      Numbers are selected in that week. If the Virus Number is not
      the number of a Rule, then a new Virus Number is selected as
      above, unless five such Virus Numbers (none of which is the
      number of a Rule) have already been selected in that week. In
      that case, the Virus is ineffective and no Rule is infected in
      that week.

      The Rulekeepor shall publish the results of the selection
      process in the Public Forum within 24 hours of the completion
      of that process. If a Rule has been infected, e shall announce
      the number of that Rule. If no Rule has been infected, then e
      shall announce that no Rule has been infected.

      Given that other Rules permit it, an infected Rule is amended
      by appending to it the following paragraph: "This Rule, apart
      from this paragraph, shall be completely without effect. Two
      weeks after this paragraph is inserted into this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule."

      There is one exception to the above: if this Rule is the
      infected Rule, then this Rule automatically Repeals itself.

      All Rule Changes by the Virus shall be Unattributed.

The Players

Rule 869/6 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose, then the
      use of that Player's Agora nickname is preferred, but not
      obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is allowed.

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

[CFJ 805: "Person" here means a natural person, not a legal person
 (such as a corporation) or something named "person."]

Rule 1676/2 (Power=1)
Grace Period for New Players

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 12 months prior to this registration, e is subject to
      a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration and
      ends two months afterwards.

      A Player is only subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir
      own registration.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Grace Periods that
      are in progress.  For each such Grace Period this list shall
      include the Player subject to the Grace Period, the time at
      which it started, and the time at which it will end.  This list
      is known as the Pink Pages, and is part of the Registrar's
      Report.

Rule 113/1 (Power=3)
Players may always opt out

      A Player may always deregister from the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player to incur
      it, may be imposed.

CFJ 826, Nov. 15 1995: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that, even
if a Player considers a penalty to be worse than deregistration, e is
still subject to it unless e actually deregisters or is deregistered.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 853, Feb. 2 1996: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that it does
not allow a Player to deregister retroactively.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 856, Feb. 20 1996: Rule 113/1 should be interpreted to mean simply
that a Player may always deregister from the Game rather than continue
to play.  The other language in the Rule is merely a gloss on that
basic content, illustrating some of its implications;it does not
change the essential meaning of the Rule.
Relevant Rules: 113

[CFJ 854: The mere belief that a penalty is worse than deregistration
is not sufficient to cause deregistration.]

      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em to
      reregister before the beginning of the next month are without
      effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause
      em to be reregistered before the beginning of the next month.

Rule 1042/7 (Power=1)
Deregistration due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Rule 1006/6 (Power=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.

      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these

      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class D Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public

      Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making the
      admission is required to post a corrected version of the
      relevant portion of the message which was in error, before one
      week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A Player
      who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction is deemed
      not to have Responded to that Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]

Rule 1550/2 (Power=1)
Ratification

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

Rule 1552/1 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

      Speaker shall become the temporary holder of that Office,

Resignation of Offices

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e

      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without
      consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.  An Officer
      who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed to have
      appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

Rule 1645/2 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      A Player who holds an Office in the normal fashion is permitted
      to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that Office,
      for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called Delegation;
      the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to as the
      Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein referred
      to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player still holds the Office in the
            normal fashion at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office in
      the normal fashion, unless the Term of Service for that Office
      has expired.  In that case, the Delegated Player continues to
      hold the Office temporarily, although the Office ceases to be a
      delegated Office.

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

Filling Vacant Offices

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the

      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be

      As soon as possible after it occurs that there is an undelegated
      Office which is being held temporarily, and for which no
      Election is already being conducted, the Registrar shall
      initiate an Election to fill that Office, as described
      elsewhere.  However, if the Office in question is that of the

      winner of that Election shall then hold that Office until e
      resigns or is retired or removed from that Office.

Rule 1486/3 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach An Officer

      An Officer is Impeached when a Referendum calling for the
      Impeachment of the Officer passes. Any Active Player is
      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting
      such to the Public Forum.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio is
      2.

      (ii)  fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report

      Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is removed from
      the Office in the performance of whose duties e has been
      Derelict.

      The Registrar is the Officer authorized to detect and report
      the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
      other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts is the Officer
      authorized to detect and report the commission of the Infraction
      of Dereliction of Duty by the Registrar.

Rule 1665/1 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class C
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as

Rule 1728/2 (Power=1)
Actions Without Objection

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without
      Objection.  Only those changes explicitly allowed by
      other Rules may be so made, and in order for such a
      change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change.

      In order to make a change Without Objection, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without Objection must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made.  The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without
      Objection (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:
      * The post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
        days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
        annoucing the intent to make the change.
      * Between the two posts, no Player has posted to the Public
        Forum eir objection to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious a

      has occured to the Public Forum as soon as possible. If a revolt
      occurs, then:

      A Statement of Policy, when issued, becomes an SLC, the
      Jurisdiction of which irrevocably consists of the Player holding
      the Office named therein. That Player shall also be its
      Maintainer.

      An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of

======================================================================
Making Proposals
  This rather large Category includes Rules regulating the
  submission and distribution of Proposals.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

[CFJ 700: Self-amending and self-repealing Rules are allowed.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107/0 (Power=3)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

      A Proposal is Disinterested if its Petition fee has not been

      is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

Rule 1723/0 (Power=1)
Sanity

      A Proposal is Sane if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal, and it
      is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for a Sane Proposal is increased by three.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane
      Proposal.

      and it is not Disinterested.

      The Petition Fee for an Emergency Proposal is increased by two.

      The Voting Period of an Emergency Proposal is five Nomic Days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify the
      Voting Period for Emergency Proposals.

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

      Any other Rule notwithstanding, in order to make a Proposal, a
      Proposing Entity must have an Executor.

      As Soon As Possible after the receipt of the Proposal, the
      Promotor shall distribute it to the Public Forum, accompanied by
      its Number, the identity of its Proposing Entity, and a clear
      indication of whether the Proposal is Disinterested.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the distribution
      of the Proposal of any legal effect.

[CFJ 10: A Proposal remains a Proposal even if the Promotor changes
 before the Proposal is distributed.
 CFJ 776: There is no failure of distribution if the Promotor
 announces he has received no Proposals when in fact he has, unless
 it has been more than one week since the Proposals were sent to em.]

Rule 1726/0 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its Execution, it takes effect when Executed.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

Rule 1451/10 (Power=1)
Disowning Proposals

      A Proposal is disowned when its Proposer sends a message to the
      Public Forum disowning it, provided that the Proposal in
      question either has not yet been distributed, or less than four
      days have passed since its distribution.  A Proposal can only be
      disowned by its Proposer, and then only if its Proposer is
      neither the Assessor nor has been the Assessor at any time after
      the distribution of that Proposal.

      The Assessor shall bill the disowning Player a fee of one
      P-Note.  All other payments or awards of Currency which would
      result from the submission of, voting upon, or adoption of that
      Proposal do not take place, regardless of the outcome of the
      Vote on that Proposal.  This Rule, however, neither requires nor
      permits any Payment Orders already executed as a result of this
      Proposal to be vacated.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would seek to
      cause the payment or award of Currencies as a result of the
      submission of, voting upon, or adoption of, a Disowned Proposal.

Rule 206/9 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary. The casting of any votes may only
      be achieved by the casting of Voting Tokens, as specified in
      other Rules.

Rule 452/11 (Power=1)
Prohibit Electioneering by Vote Collectors

      For the purposes of this Rule, a Vote Collector is defined as
      any Player to whom the Rules give the responsibility of
      tallying votes on a Proposal, Referendum or Election. Hence
      this Rule explicitly regulates the behaviour of the Assessor
      with respect to Proposals, and the behaviour of any Player
      (generally the Registrar or the Speaker) who acts as Vote
      Collector in an Election or Referendum.

      During the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal, Election or
      Referendum, anyone who has served as Vote Collector for that
      Proposal, Election, or Referendum is prohibited from making use
      of any knowledge of the current status of the vote on that
      Proposal, Election or Referendum which e would not have had e
      not served as Vote Collector, in any attempt to influence the
      result of the vote on the Proposal, Election or Referendum.
      Doing so is the Crime of Electioneering, a Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prevent a player from transferring
      voting records to the current Vote Collector. Doing so is not a
      Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum, as
      long as e does not indicate specifically whether the Voting
      Entity has voted or declared Presence. Doing so is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

[CFJ 36: The Assessor may not use eir knowledge of the Votes to
 withdraw or disown a Proposal.
 CFJ 750: Only if the Assessor has the intent of influencing Votes
 is e in violation of this Rule.  Influencing the number of Votes
 also counts as influencing the result of the vote.]

Rule 1625/2 (Power=1)
Secrecy of Votes

      A Player who discloses the Vote or Votes cast by a Voting Entity
      before the end of the Voting Period of a Proposal commits the
      Crime of Breach of Voting Secrecy, a Class C Crime, unless one
      or more of the following applies:

        a) that Player did not at any time during the Voting Period of
           that Proposal, hold the Office of Assessor;
        b) that Player is the Executor of the Voting Entity whose
           Vote(s) were disclosed;
        c) the disclosure is made only to the Voting Entity (or its
           Executor) whose Vote(s) were disclosed; or
        d) the disclosure is required by another Rule.

Rule 683/5 (Power=1)
Legal Votes

      A Vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a Vote upon a Proposal.

      A Vote cast upon a Proposal by a Voting Entity which has an
      Executor is cast at the time its Executor either posts it to the
      Public Forum or otherwise sends it to the Assessor.  A Vote is
      legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of that
      Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
      on that particular Proposal.

      A Vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any Entity to cast Votes upon
      Proposals.

Announcing One's Presence

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule

      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for

      At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker may
      make it a Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.
      If that does not happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If any Entity other than a Senator has already Voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, their Votes
      on that Proposal change to ABSTAIN, and cannot change
      thereafter, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, and at the
      end of the Voting Period, the cost of casting those Votes is
      transferred to them.

Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which

      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

      At the end of the Voting Period for a Proposal, if a Proposal
      has received more FOR Votes than AGAINST Votes, the Assessor
      shall pay out to the Sponsor a number of P-Notes equal to the
      number of FOR Votes less the number of AGAINST Votes.

      If, however, a Proposal has received more AGAINST Votes than FOR
      Votes, the Assessor shall bill the Sponsor for a number of
      P-Notes equal the number of AGAINST Votes less the number of FOR
      Votes.

      If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a Proposal are not the same
      entity and the Proposal passes, the Assessor shall pay out 2
      P-Notes to the Proposer.  If the Sponsor and the Proposer of a
      Proposal are not the same and the Proposal fails, the Assessor
      shall bill the Proposer 1 P-Note.  This is in addition to any
      other payments required by this or other Rules.

      For the purpose of this Rule, Votes by Voting Entities which are

Referenda and Elections

Rule 1434/3 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      * Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
      Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
      sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting,
      at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those Players who
      have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      1 for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the Referendum
      fails.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

Rule 1445/7 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for taking nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and
      announcing the result. Unless otherwise specified, this Entity
      is the Player who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
      If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the Vote
      Collector for the entire duration of the Referendum.

      If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered before the
      Voting Period ends, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nominating Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Nominate
      eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the time a
      Player makes a Nomination.

      * Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by sending
      a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominations Period,
      indicating what Election e is Nominating for.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the
      Vote  Collector, indicating the e wished to retract eir
      Nomination.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
      Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for the
      Election.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
      Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside of
      the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * Announcing Candidates : the Vote Collector shall announce to
      the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
      Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the
      Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time
      Candidates are Announced, which shall be conducted using the
      standard procedure for Referendum Voting with the following
      exceptions :

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
      same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
      Candidates for the given Election. Words which are effectively
      synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
      the most votes were cast. If there is more than one such
      candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those candidates as the
      winner, and must announce eir chosen candidate as winner to the
      Public Forum.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of an Election is
      not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, the Election has no Winner.

      * Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an Election
      are effective at the time the results of the Referendum are
      announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at the time that the
      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

Rule 1626/1 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice

Rule 698/3 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to Judge a a given CFJ unless

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to Judge that CFJ.

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,

      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the

      eligible to Judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding

      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall

Rule 1565/5 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule, and only
      when issued by the Judge within the permitted deliberation
      period.  Dismissal occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal
      dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1
      VT.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

Rule 502/4 (Power=1)
Salary for Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, whenever a Player has earned a
      judicial salary, make a report of this fact in the Public Forum.
      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Clerk of the Court
      shall pay out the judicial salaries earned during the preceding
      week, except as noted below.

      Any judicial salary earned but not yet paid shall not be paid if
      the decision for which the salary was earned is currently
      subject to an appeal at the end of the Nomic Week in which it
      was earned.  In this case, the salary shall be paid at the end
      of the Nomic Week in which the appeal is decided, and then only
      if the appeal upholds the original decision.

      If a decision is overturned in the same Nomic Week in which it
      was made, no salary shall be paid for the original decision.

      If a decision is not subject to an appeal at the end of the
      Nomic Week in which it is made, but is subsequently appealed in
      a later Nomic Week and overturned on appeal, the Clerk of the
      Court shall vacate the Payment Order paying the salary
      originally received for that decision.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

Rule 1571/2 (Power=1)
Legal Force of Injunctions

      A legally made Injunction takes effect 72 hours from its
      publication by the CotC in the Public Forum. If, before it takes
      effect, either the Injunction or the Judgement it accompanies is
      appealed, its effect is deferred until the resolution of the
      appeal(s).

      If an appeal involving an Injunction which has not taken effect,
      and which was originally attached to a Judgement, or the
      Judgement to which it is attached resolves, and neither the
      Injunction nor the Judgement has been overturned, and no other
      appeal is pending on the Injunction or the Judgement, the
      Injunction takes effect immediately upon resolution of the
      appeal.

      If an appeal fails to uphold an Injunction, or the Judgement
      it accompanies, the Injunction is set aside immediately upon
      resolution of that appeal.

Rule 1573/3 (Power=1)
Penalties for Violations of Injunctions

      A Player is required to perform all actions required of em by a
      legal Injunction within 72 hours of it taking effect, unless the
      Injunction is set aside prior to that time.  Failure to do so is
      the Crime of Violating an Injunction by Omission, a Class C
      Crime.

      A Player is required to refrain from all actions prohibited em
      by a legal Injunction, for the duration that it is in effect.
      Each performance of such an action is the Crime of Violating an
      Injunction by Commission, a Class C Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining to
      Injunctions.

Rule 1742/0 (Power=1)
Agreements Between Players

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary
      to effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

Rule 1365/6 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

      Specific elements of a Judge's decision are subject to review by

      specified in this Rule.

      In each case, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, shall initiate a particular appeal.

      The insistence of a single Player shall initiate an appeal if
      the appeal is of an Injunction which names the insisting Player,
      if the appeal is of a Judgement that found a Crime had been
      committed by the insisting Player, or if the insisting Player is
      the Judge who made the decision that is appealed.

      The elements that are permitted to be appealed, what the Board
      is to consider, and what results from its findings, are as
      follows:

        i) The Judgement of the CFJ;
       ii) The Dismissal of a CFJ;
      iii) An Injunction issued with a Judgement.

Rule 1447/10 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      All three Justices receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT each
      upon the publication of their determinations.

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

      If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not

      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

Appeal of an Injunction

      If an Injuction issued with a Judgement is Appealed, the

      If the Board rules that an Injunction on the Judgement in
      question would be appropriate, and all members of the Board
      agree as to what Injunction to Append, the Injunction is made.
      Such an Injunction is legal if and only if it would have been
      legal, had it been made by the original judge.

      If the Board rules that an Injunction would not be appropriate,

Rule 908/10 (Power=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Call for Judgement alleges that a Player (herein called the
      Ninny) has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, or to have committed one or more
      Crimes, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the Ninny must submit
      to the Public Forum a Formal Apology within 72 hours of the
      publication of Judgement, unless that Judgement is successfully
      appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      containing all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

      The Player who called the initial CFJ has the duty to report to
      the Herald any Blots gained through this rule.

Crimes and Infractions
  This Category includes general Rules regarding Crimes and
  Infractions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1503/3 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

      A Player shall only be subject to the penalty for a Crime after
      a CFJ has explicitly found that the Player has committed that
      Crime, or after an appeal to a Judgement finds so.

      A Player shall be subject to the penalty for an Infraction as
      soon as it is reported by the Player in charge of detecting
      that Infraction.

      There are no Crimes or Infractions outside those defined in the
      Rules.  If a Rule defines a Crime or Infraction without
      specifying an explicit penalty, or a class of penalty that is
      defined in the Rules, then that Crime or Infraction imposes no
      penalty.

      Any Rule that defines an Infraction must also specify a
      Player or Players who are authorized to detect and report
      the commission of that Infraction; otherwise, the Infraction
      carries no penalty.

      Any penalties reported by unauthorized persons have no effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1504/5 (Power=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

CFJ 939, Sep. 16, 1997: The provision in R1504 which states that:
      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.
should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

Rule 1652/0 (Power=1)
Double Jeopardy

      No Player shall be subject to the application of more than one
      penalty for each specific instance of a particular Crime or
      Infraction.

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Infraction resulting
      from that act.  If the penalties for any one Crime or Infraction
      are reversed upon appeal, such penalties may not be reinstated
      for that particular Crime or Infraction based upon that specific
      act.

      This Rule does not forbid the re-application of a penalty whose
      reversal is rescinded by CFJ or an appeal to a CFJ.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that applies Crimes or
      Infractions, or the penalties thereof.

Rule 1509/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Recourse for Nonreporting of Infractions

      Any Player who believes that an Infraction has occurred, but
      which has not been reported by a Player authorized to report it,
      is permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging thus.

      If the Judgement of the CFJ upholds the allegation, then the
      Judge of the CFJ shall be authorized to, and shall be obligated
      to, report the Infraction as provided by other Rules.  This Rule
      takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the Judge's
      report of an infraction from having legal effect.

The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Injunction.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * The Attribution of each Rule
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

Rule 1667/3 (Power=1)
Origination of Rules

      Every Rule has one Originator.

      The Originator of a Rule is the Entity responsible for that
      Rule's text as it first appeared in the Ruleset.  The Originator
      of all Rules in the Initial Ruleset is Peter Suber. In the case
      of a Rule resulting from a proposed Rule Change, the Originator
      of that Rule is the Entity that proposed the Creation of the
      Rule. In the case of a Rule Created by a non-proposed Rule
      Change, the Originator of that Rule is the Rule that mandated
      the non-proposed Creation of the Rule.

      The Originator of a Rule shall not change.

Rule 1668/1 (Power=1)
Authorship of Rules

      Every Rule has one or more Authors.

      An Author of a Rule is an Entity responsible for some
      substantial portion of either the Rule's text, or its meaning,
      as it currently appears in the Ruleset.

      The first Author of any Rule is that Rule's Originator.

      Whenever a proposed Amendment makes more than a cosmetic change
      to a Rule, the Entity which proposed the Amendment becomes an
      Author of that Rule.

      If a non-proposed Amendment makes more than a cosmetic change to
      a Rule, the Rule that mandated the non-proposed Rule Change
      becomes an Author of that Rule.

      An Entity cannot become Author of a Rule as a result of an
      Amendment that did not apply to that Rule.  An Entity also
      cannot become Author of a Rule as a result of an Amendment that
      the Rules explicitly state is to be Unattributed.  All cosmetic
      Amendments are to be Unattributed.

      For Purpose of this Rule, the Rulekeepor shall be final arbiter
      of what constitutes a "substantial portion" of a Rule's text or
      meaning, and what constitutes only a "cosmetic" change.
      However, any change to a Rule that alters the way that Rule is
      applied, or alters more than half the text of a Rule, shall be
      deemed by the Rulekeepor as substantial, and any change that
      makes no alteration in either the semantic content or the
      application of a Rule shall be deemed by the Rulekeepor as
      cosmetic.

      If, after any Rule Change, the Rulekeepor feels that the
      contribution of any particular Author is completely absent from
      a Rule's text or meaning, then that Entity can be removed as an
      Author from that Rule. This shall be determined at the
      Rulekeepor's discretion.

      The Rulekeepor is permitted to follow any procedure e deems
      appropriate in making determinations required by this Rule. E is
      also permitted to reverse emself if e feels the circumstances
      merit it.

      Proposal and the Entity that proposed it, or Rule-- or other
      entity-- which mandated the Change), and the date upon which the
      change took effect.  Other Rules may require additional
      information to appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule
      Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

Rule 1706/1 (Power=1)
Locations

      There is a class of Entities called Locations.  Each Location
      has a unique name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Locations.

      There is a Property called Position, the value of which is a
      Location.  The Position of a Location is itself.  "An Entity's
      Location" is an unambiguous reference to that Entity's Position,
      and the Entity is said to be "at that Location".

      There is a Location named "the Origin".  The initial Location of
      any Entity with a Location is the Origin, unless otherwise
      specified.  If a Location ceases to be a Location, then the
      Location of all Entities at that Location becomes the Origin.

      All Players have a Location.

      The Cartographor is authorized to change the name of any
      Location not specifically mentioned by name in the Rules
      Without Objection.

Distance

      A Path is an ordered sequence of one or more Locations such that

      preceding it (if any) and the Location following it (if any).
      A Path is said to be "from" the first Location in the sequence
      and "to" the last Location in the sequence.

      The Length of a Path is one less than the number of Locations in
      it.

      The Distance between two Locations (which may be identical) is
      the minimum Length of a Path from the first to the second.  If
      there is no such Path, then the Distance between them is
      undefined.

      determined by the Degree to be Granted.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the Granting of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      Granted.

      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Archivist shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events
      which have occured in Agora within at least the last eight
      weeks, and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power
      of at least 2.

      The Degree of Master of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the

      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 2.

Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

Rule 1722/0 (Power=1)
Minting of Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when Mintor of that Currency posts in
      the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that

      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

Rule 1599/2 (Power=1)
Failure to Execute Payment Orders

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment Order, e is

      required to execute a Payment Order by the Rules fails to do so
      in the time required by this and other Rules, and a CFJ
      determines that this has in fact happened, the Judge of that CFJ
      shall make an Injunction requiring emself to execute the Order
      required in the stead of the nonperforming Player.  If a Player
      deregisters or goes On Hold without executing a Payment Order
      which e was required to execute, the Speaker shall execute it
      instead.

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different time
      limit for executing Payment Orders.

Rule 1598/3 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Transfer Order is submitted when the Executor of the source
      entity specified in the Order transmits the Order to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in the Order, or whenever
      the Rules otherwise state that a Transfer Order is submitted.
      Unless otherwise specified, a Transfer Order is executed upon
      being submitted.  In no case may any Transfer Order be executed
      prior to its submission or without having ever been submitted.

      When a Transfer Order is executed, if the source possesses at
      least as many units of the specified Currency as specified in
      the Order, the number of units of that specified Currency shall
      be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
      entity.  Such an Order is said to have been successfully
      executed.

      However, if the source entity does not possess sufficient units
      of the specified Currency, then no transfer occurs, and the
      Recordkeepor shall, as soon as possible, notify the Executors of
      the source and destination that the Transfer Order was not
      successfully executed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall be completely
      without effect. Two weeks after this paragraph is inserted into
      this Rule, this paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Rule 1746/0 (Power=1)
Illegal Transfer Orders

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.

      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

Rule 1730/0 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

Implicit Transfer Orders

      The Rules, and only the Rules, may specify that certain actions,

      more Transfer Orders, as long as the action which is implicitly
      the submission of a Transfer Order is the sending of a message
      from the Executor of the source entity of the Transfer Order to
      the Recordkeepor of the Currency involved, or to the Public
      Forum.  Such implicitly submitted Transfer Orders may be delayed
      Transfer Orders, if the Rules which specify them as implicit
      Transfers Orders also specify them to be delayed.  A
      Recordkeepor may not reject a implicitly submitted delayed
      Transfer Order.

      Similarly, the Rules may specify that certain actions are also
      implicitly cancellations of certain types of delayed Transfer
      Orders, subject to the same restrictions specified above for
      implicitly submitted Transfer Orders.

Rule 1596/2 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts the Order to the Public
      Forum.

      A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment Order if e
      required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to execute that
      Order.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.  However, the Recordkeepor need only maintain records
      of satisfied or vacated Orders for four weeks after they have
      been satisfied or vacated.

      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

      vacated.  This notice must clearly identify the Payment Order

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency in that Payment Order shall execute a new Payment
      Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with the payor
      and payee interchanged.

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which was executed

      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      Each Recordkeepor is authorized to report this Infraction, which

      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player in VTs for an
      amount not in excess of 1 VT.  The Player to receive the award
      must not have received a Patronage award within the preceding
      four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a reason along with the
      Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the

Probate

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses any units of

      and its destruction deferred until it leaves Probate.  Such an

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      When a Player is deregistered, e shall be placed in Probate.  A
      deregistered Player is a "terminal estate" for the purpose of
      Probate, but ceases to be such if e reregisters while still in

Rule 1637/2 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Rule 1738/1 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

Rule 1739/0 (Power=1)
The Probate Code

      Section 1. General

      The steps described herein shall be executed by an Executor in
      Probate, in order by increasing section number.

      If, in order to perform the duties required herein, the Executor
      in Probate would have to consider, in any way, a Payment Order
      which is presently disputed, e shall not proceed, but shall wait
      until the dispute regarding that Payment Order is resolved.

      Section 2. Procedure for Fair Division

      When an amount of Currency (either as units in possession of the
      estate, or units due the estate as credits) is to be divided,
      the following procedure shall be used:

      1. The Executor in Probate shall first divide the amount of
         Currency amongst the creditors of the estate proportionally
         to the residual debts of each creditor, rounding each share
         down to the appropriate MUQ.  The surplus is the amount
         remaining after this initial division is completed.
      2. The surplus, if any, shall then be added to the share of the
         creditor with the greatest remaining residual debt whose
         share does not already equal eir remaining residual debt.  In
         the event of a tie, the Executor in Probate shall select a
         creditor at random.  If there is no such creditor, the
         surplus is retained.  This step shall be repeated until there
         is no more surplus, or no more creditors with residual debt
         unequal to their share.
      3. If at any time in the above process, any portion of any
         creditor's share exceeds eir residual debt, this excess
         portion shall be removed from eir share and added to the
         surplus.

      Section 3. Distribution of Assets to Creditors

      For each Currency of which the estate possesses units, the
      Executor in Probate shall divide those units according to the
      procedure in Section 2, and shall submit Transfer Orders from
      the estate to each creditor for the amount of that creditor's
      share.

      Section 4. Reassignment of Credits to Creditors

      For each debtor of the estate, in an order to be determined by
      the Executor in Probate, the Executor in Probate shall determine
      the sum of the credits due the estate from that debtor
      (separately for each Currency), and shall divide that sum
      amongst the creditors according to the procedure in Section 2,
      and shall execute Payment Orders from that debtor to each
      creditor for the amount of that creditor's share.  If there is a
      surplus amount, the Executor in Probate shall execute a Payment
      Order from the creditor to the estate for the amount of the
      surplus.  The Executor in Probate shall then vacate the credits
      thus reassigned.

      Section 5. Discharge of Residual Debts

      The Executor in Probate shall vacate all remaining debts of the
      estate.

      Section 6. Distribution of Residual Assets to Heirs

      This step is skipped if the estate is not terminal.

      The Executor in Probate shall execute the provisions of the Will
      of the estate, if a Will exists.  If residual assets exist after
      the execution of the Will, the Executor in Probate shall
      distribute them to the heirs of the estate in the manner
      described in Sections 3 and 4, except that heirs replace
      creditors, and each heir is considered to have residual debt
      computed according to the provisions for division as specified

Rule 1442/11 (Power=1)
Using VTs

      The casting of any votes may only be achieved by the spending
      of VTs, as specified below.

      A Voting Entity Votes upon a Proposal when e, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, informs the Assessor of the Vote (or
      Votes) e is casting upon that Proposal.  This act also comprises
      the implicit submission of a delayed Transfer Order from the
      Voting Entity to the Bank for however many VTs are necessary to
      cast those Votes, to be executed at the end of the Voting Period
      of that Proposal, and also the implicit cancellation of all
      other delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity may specify that e casts no Votes on a Proposal,
      and doing so cancels any previously Votes cast on that Proposal
      (if done during the Voting Period of that Proposal) and cancels
      any delayed Transfer Orders submitted but not yet executed by
      Voting on that Proposal.

      A Voting Entity's Votes on a given Proposal are counted for that
      Proposal only if the delayed Transfer Order implicitly submitted
      by Voting on that Proposal is successfully executed at the end
      of the Voting Period of that Proposal.

Style Points and the Wizard
  This Category includes Rules concerning Style Points and the
  Office of the Wizard.

Rule 1542/3 (Power=1)
Style Points

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      At the beginning of every quarter, all Players have their Style
      set to zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      A Player's Style can only change as provided for in this Rule.

Indulgences and Blots
  This Category includes Rules concerning Indulgences and Blots.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1435/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof
      since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule
      states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment
      Order shall be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank
      as the payee, and for a number of Indulgences equal to the
      number of Blots that Player is to receive.  This order is to be
      executed by whomever is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

Rule 1714/2 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
      number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has
      more than 30 Overdue Blots.

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

      To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
      Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered, or which would allow em
      to reregister.

Rule 1747/0 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, he may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
      following events may occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may immediately reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in his Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period he must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to his debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

Rule 1439/5 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the wording of the
      violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
      case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
      case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

Fugitives from Justice

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not

      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
      rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
      one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
      assess against em a number of Blots equal to the number of
      Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
      reregistration.  Eir Fugitive Blots are then removed.

Rule 1647/2 (Power=1)
Office of the Speaker-Elect

      Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has
      the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.
      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

      The CotC and Justiciar may not Nominate for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a
      Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker(or for any
      other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of
      Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as
      Arbiter of Succession.

      The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Rule 1648/2 (Power=1)
When the Speaker is Tainted

      The Speaker is Tainted whenever the Player who is Speaker became
      Speaker by any means other than a normal Speaker transition.

      A normal Speaker transition occurs whenever the Rules require
      the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

      If the Rules require the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker, and
      that Office is held temporarily, the Speaker-Elect still becomes
      Speaker, but the resulting Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, the Speaker-Elect shall become Speaker.

      to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the
      Public Forum.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and its Adoption Ratio is

Rule 942/7 (Power=1)
Replacement of Impossible Speaker

      If a Speaker is determined by CFJ to have made further play
      impossible by eir actions or lack thereof, and the CFJ is not
      appealed within the allowed time, or if such a determination
      is made upon appeal of a CFJ; AND if the Speaker has not changed
      since the CFJ was made, then the Player who holds the Office
      of Speaker-Elect immediately becomes Speaker, and the old
      Speaker ceases to be Speaker.

      A Speaker who makes further play impossible by eir actions or
      lack thereof commits the Crime of Speaker Impossibility, a Class
      A Crime.

      "Impossible" is defined here to mean overwhelmingly psychotic
      behavior, a complete lack of interest in the Game, or
      uncooperativeness of the highest order. It does *not* include
      normal Speaker latitudes which have been taken by past Speakers
      for various reasons, whether justifiable or not, including but
      not limited to: temporary suspension of proposal distribution,
      resetting of scores, or accidental illegal actions. The Judge of
      the CFJ *must* take these extremely tight standards into
      account, and the accused Speaker *must* be given an opportunity
      to defend eirself.

      This Rule adds to the set of valid classes of Judgements, and
      takes precedence over other Rules which may attempt to prevent
      this class of Judgement.

Rule 786/6 (Power=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to
      be:

      the Promotor
      the Assessor
      the Justiciar
      the Clerk of the Courts
      the Rulekeepor
      the Registrar
      the Archivist
      all Officers in order of most recent registration
      all Active Players in order of most recent registration

      except that the Speaker does not appear in the Order.  The Order
      of Succession is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      Any Rule which requires the Office of Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, the Speaker-Elect shall not be
      chosen according to that Rule. This Rule takes precedence over
      such Rules.  (If this would ever result in the Speaker filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, then the Speaker-Elect shall
      instead be filled by the Order of Succession, with the Speaker
      as Arbiter of Succession.)

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled, the Arbiter of
      Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce in the Public
      Forum that the Office of Speaker-Elect is being temporarily
      filled by this Rule.  Once this announcement has been made, each
      Player has three days to decline to fill the Office by sending a
      message to the Arbiter stating e does so.

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is
      held by that Active Player highest in the order of succession
      who has not yet declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one
      Active Player in the order of succession who has not declined,
      that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

      As soon as possible after, and within four days of, the filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Arbiter of Succession shall
      announce which Active Player is now the Speaker-Elect.

      Announcements by the Arbiter have no effect on the identity of
      the Speaker-Elect.

Rule 402/5 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

     Whenever the Rules call for the Speaker-Elect to become Speaker:

       1) The Speaker shall forward copies of all necessary materials
          for the performance of eir position, as soon as possible to
          the Speaker-Elect.
       2) The Speaker-Elect shall acknowledge the receipt of said
          materials as soon as possible after step 1.
       3) As soon as possible after step 2, the Speaker shall post a
          message to the Public Forum announcing that the
          Speaker-Elect has become the Speaker.  At the "Date:" of
          the Speaker's posting, the old Speaker shall cease to be
          Speaker and the Speaker-Elect shall become the Speaker.

      If the Speaker-Elect changes before the completion of this
      procedure, it must be begun again from step 1.

      If another Rule specifies that the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker before the completion of step 3, such as the case when
      the Rules require an immediate Speaker transition, then this
      Rule defers to it, and the procedure above need not be
      completed.

      However, in any case where the above procedure is not completed
      before a transition of Speakers takes place, the new Speaker is
      still obliged to make a reasonable effort to obtain all
      materials necessary for the performance of eir duties from the
      former Speaker.  If this is not possible, then the new Speaker
      shall make a reasonable attempt to recover this information from
      other sources. (The Players, the Officers, the Archivist etc.)

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the

      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that

      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of three Blots, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

Rule 1457/10 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If, any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

Rule 1590/1 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      Compact between the time of the request and the time of its

Application to Create an Organization

      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create

      upon Execution, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      An valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      being sent to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be Executed.

Dissolution of Organizations

      An Organization shall only be dissolved when the Rules or the
      Organization's SLC require it.  An Organization shall be
      required to be dissolved whenever any of the following
      conditions are true:

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Administrator.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      The Notary is required to detect when an Administrative
      Dissolution takes place.

      As soon as possible after an Organization dissolves, for any
      reason, the Notary shall report that dissolution to the Public
      Forum.

      All Organizations cease to exist upon dissolution. Other Rules
      can require an Organization to dissolve under other
      circumstances.

Rule 766/8 (Power=1)
Groups

      There is a class of Organization known collectively as the class
      of Groups.  Each single Organization within this class is a
      Group.  An SLC associated with a Group is that Group's
      Ordinances.  A Group's Administrator is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor.  A Group's Executor is that Group's Vizier. The
      set of Players within the Jurisdiction of that Group's SLC is
      that Group's Membership.

      A Group's Membership is permitted to contain any Player who is
      not a Member of any other Group.

      A Group must have at least three Foundors, who constitute the
      Group's initial Membership.  Both the Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group.

      Votes FOR or 3 Votes AGAINST the Proposal in question, and
      informs the Assessor that it is electing to cast a Unity Vote on
      that Proposal, then that Group has declared Unity on that

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and all of its Members
      Vote on that Proposal, and all of the Votes of its Members are
      the same as the Votes of the Group, then the Group is entitled
      to cast 3 Votes on that Proposal, at zero cost.  Furthermore,
      the Assessor shall pay out 3 VTs to the Group.

      If a Group declares Unity on a Proposal, and not all of its
      Members express an Intent to Vote, or not all of the intended
      Votes of its Members are the same as the intended Votes of the
      Group, then the Group is not entitled to cast any Votes on that

Regulations and Membership of Contests

      No Player within Jurisdiction of a Contest's Regulations is
      bound to obey any Regulation or combination of Regulations that
      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become
           Contestmaster without eir consent.  If left unspecified,
           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

      amount of Kudos a Player holds is called eir Honour. All Players
      possess at all times an integral number of Kudos not less than
      0.

      A new Player, or a Player with no Kudo record starts with 20
      Kudos. If a Player is deregistered but returns within three
      months, e starts with the same number of Kudos e had when e
      left. If e returns after a longer time than three months, e is
      treated as a new Player with respect to Kudos.

The Shogun

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Shogun".

      Whenever a Player is a Samurai, that Player has at least as

      The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
      Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would permit otherwise.

      The Herald shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a Player
      receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible after such
      award or revocation occurs.

      Person. If, during the prior Week, the prior Silly Person failed
      to designate an eligible Player to be Silly, the Silly Person
      shall be the first eligible Player so designated-- by anyone--
      in the Public Forum.

      Active Players are eligible to be Silly if they have not been
      Silly for at least the two prior Nomic Weeks.

History:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1651/4 (Power=1)
The Silly Proposal

      During the week in which e is a Silly Person, the Silly Person
      is obligated to produce a Silly Proposal and publish it in the
      Public Forum, as well as submit it for a vote.  A Proposal is a
      Silly Proposal only if it is clearly marked as such when
      published and submitted.  No Proposals by Players other than the
      Silly Person are Silly Proposals, nor are any further Proposals
      offered by the Silly Person in a Nomic Week in which e has
      already proposed a Silly Proposal.

      The Silly Proposal's sole contents must be one of the following:

        i) A limerick.
       ii) A rhymed poem no longer than fourteen lines. (No free
           verse!)
      iii) A joke of no more than a hundred words.
       iv) A truly hideous pun.

      The Silly Proposal has an AI=2 and has the effect of giving its
      Proposer 1 VT if adopted. (The Assessor shall take note and
      report this Silly VT.)

      If the Silly Proposal is adopted unanimously, then the Patent
      Title of Grande Foole is bestowed upon the Player who proposed
      it.  This title is held by this Player until some other poor
      fool has it thrust upon them.

      If the Silly Person does not produce a Silly Proposal during the
      week in which e is the Silly Person, then he is guilty of the
      Infraction of Seriousness, with the penalty of 0.5 VT. This may
      be detected and reported by any Player.

Frankenstein
  This Category includes the various Rules relating to the
  Frankenstein Monster.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1671/92 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

Rule 1672/2 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Generator

      This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Generator, and can
      be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule
      specifies the only ways in which the Frankenstein Rule can
      undergo a Rule Change.

      Rule Changes to the Frankenstein Rule must conform to the
      following restrictions:

        i) The Frankenstein Rule cannot be repealed.

       ii) No Rule Change can add text to the Frankenstein Rule unless
           it adds that text between the first and last paragraphs of
           the Rule.

      iii) No Rule Change can alter, add, or remove text from the
           first or last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

       iv) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly forbids a specific
           property or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule
           Change can be adopted that grants the Frankenstein Monster
           that property or effect. (Deletion of the language
           forbidding that property or effect does not grant that
           property or effect.)

        v) If the Frankenstein Rule explicitly grants a specific
           property or effect to the Frankenstein Monster, no Rule
           Change can be adopted that denies the Frankensein Monster
           that property or effect.  (Deletion of the language
           granting that property or effect does not deny that
           property or effect.)

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs. No proposed
           Amendment changing existing text beyond such an insertion
           shall be applied to the Frankenstein Rule, and no other
           proposed Rule Changes shall be applied to the Frankenstein
           Rule.

     viii) Whenever a Win by Pitchfork is legally announced by the Mad
           Scientist, all text between the first and last paragraphs
           of the Frankenstein Rule shall be deleted from the
           Frankenstein Rule.

       ix) Any Non-proposed Rule Changes not specified in this Rule,
           can only be applied to the Frankenstein Rule by the
           Frankenstein Mutator, as described by that Rule.

      No Rule Changes are permitted to this Rule that would alter, in
      any way, the restrictions this Rule makes on the Rule Changes
      that can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule permitting Rule Changes to the
      Frankenstein Rule other than those described in this Rule, and
      over any Rule that would permit Rule Changes forbidden by this
      Rule.

Rule 1673/3 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Mutator

      This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein Mutator, and can be
      referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This Rule specifies
      the way in which the Frankenstein Rule shall undergo
      non-proposed Rule Changes.  All Rule Changes mandated by this
      Rule shall be subject to the restrictions that the Frankenstein
      Generator makes on Rule Changes in general.

      Once a week the following Rule Changes shall occur to the
      Frankenstein Rule:

       i) If there are at least ten sentences between the first and
          last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule, then N of those
          sentences shall be deleted as follows.  Here, N is 1/10
          of the number of sentences between the first and last
          paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule prior to the deletion,
          rounded down to the nearest integer.
          1) The Mad Scientist shall randomly select 2N different
             sentences from those between the first and last
             paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.
          2) The Mad Scientist shall choose N of the sentences
             selected in step i.1, and those sentences shall be
             deleted from the Frankenstein Rule.

      ii) One sentence shall be inserted between the first and last
          paragraph of the Frankenstein Rule in the following manner;
          1) The Mad Scientist selects a Rule, at random, from among
             all Rules in the Ruleset.
          2) The Mad Scientist shall select any one complete sentence
             e wishes from within the randomly selected Rule.
          3) The Mad Scientist shall select any noun (which can be a
             compound of two or more words) e wishes from within the
             selected sentence.
          4) The Mad Scientist shall replace each instance of the
             selected noun with the noun "Frankenstein Monster". (Or
             its plural, possessive, or other form if appropriate.)
          5) As long as the resulting sentence conforms to the
             restrictions that the Frankenstein Generator makes upon
             proposed Amendments, the sentence shall be inserted, at
             any point the Mad Scientist wishes, between the first and
             last paragraphs of the Frankenstein Rule.

      The Mad Scientist shall make the above selections as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week.  E shall
      publish the resulting Rule Changes in the Public Forum within 24
      hours after these selections are made.

>"Immediately after becoming Speaker, Morendil was registered as a player."
>======================================================================
>Judge:       Steve
>======================================================================

Some preliminary remarks are in order. Firstly, on the logical form
of the Statement: Immediately after event A occurred, event B occurred.
I take this as implying that event A actually did occur. Therefore,
among the matters to be considered is the question of whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. If he did not, then the Statement would
be FALSE.

Secondly, on the use of the phrase 'immediately after'. There is some
temptation to think that if the Rules support the conclusion that
Morendil's becoming Speaker brought in its train his registration,
that these events happened, strictly speaking, at the same time, and
not one after the other. It might be argued that in that case, the
Statement is trivially FALSE. However, given our history of
interpreting some events as happening at the same time but in a
particular order, I'm inclined to allow the Caller some latitude in
this respect. If the Rules support the conlusion that Morendil did
become Speaker, and that he was registered as a result, in my view a
Judgement that the Statement is TRUE is indicated.

The first question to be considered, therefore, is whether Morendil
actually did become Speaker. A consensus seems have developed that he
did, but I think it is worth rehearsing, and putting on the Judicial
record, the arguments to that effect. These are, briefly, as follows:
R1445 states that "The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
whom the most votes were cast." Morendil was a Candidate for the
Office of Speaker-Elect, and nothing in the Rules implies that he
ceased to be one when he was deregistered during the Voting Period.
He did receive the most votes in the Election, beating General Chaos
5-4, and was therefore the Winner of the Election. R790 states that
"The winner of [an] Election...hold[s] [the] Office until e resigns
or is retired or removed from that Office" and this Rule takes
precedence over R1006 which states that an Office must be held by a
Player.  Morendil therefore became the first non-Player ever to hold
Office, holding the Office of Speaker-Elect as of Oct. 17. A Revolt
occurred on Nov. 3, and in accordance with R1664, Morendil became
Speaker. Crucially, this was not blocked by R103, which states only
that "each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker; no Player
may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker." Since Morendil was not
a Player when he became Speaker, these provisions did not apply to
him and could not have been violated. This is sufficient to establish
that Morendil did indeed become Speaker.

We turn now to the second question, that of Morendil's registration. 
Although Morendil was not a Player when he became Speaker, his
becoming Speaker caused him to become a Player, or at least to be
deemed to be a Player for all legal purposes, which amounts to the
same thing. This is because R103 states that "The term "Player" in
the Rules shall specifically include...the Speaker." 

Now, the first paragraph of R869 states that:

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

My initial inclination was to take R103 as implying, in conjunction
with R869, that being the Speaker is a sufficient condition for being
registered as a Player. On further consideration, however, I am now
inclined to reject this view. Being Registered is defined by R869
and not by R103. There is no conflict between the two Rules on the
question of what it is to be Registered. The conflict arises only
over the question of what it is to be a Player. In effect, the first
paragraph of R869 states that a Player is any person who has sent a
message to PF requesting Registration. This brings R869 into conflict
with R103, which makes Morendil a Player despite his not having sent
such a message to the PF since the time of his last deregistration,
on Oct 14. This conflict R103 wins. Thus it is my judgement that we
should properly regard Morendil as having become a Player without
being, or becoming, Registered.

I therefore rule that the Statement is FALSE.

With all REAL AMERICANS off eating TURKEY, I have of course had much of
peace and quiet scheming and planning for to TAKE OVER THE WORLD.  Even
most of the SPAMMERS seem to have calmed down, for a while.

Petty claims have come forward by a self-claimed programmer that I am
using too little ENTROPY in my Random selections.  To throw the swine some
pearls, I will start using /DEV/RANDOM characters.

Of COURSE, since /dev/RANDOM does not provide directly numbers 0-32767,
this requires me ONCE AGAIN to modify my METHOD.

I shall replace echo $RANDOM with the following COMMAND:

perl -e 'print unpack(S,`head -c 2 /dev/random`)>>1,"\n";'

Very WELL.

As COMMONLY there are 12 sentences between the first and last paragraph of
e Olde Frankenstein Rule.

The FIRST number is 16304, which gives 16, and the second number is 24049,
which gives 2.  The first sentence is number 8:

      A Contest's Administrator is that Contest's Frankenstein
      Monster.

I shall have to select among Sentences 9-12, and 1-7.  Next number: 
10025, DISCARDED.  Then 30848, DISCARDED.  24545, giving 45, or 1 (mod
11).  Sentence number 9 is selected:

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

Ah, what a PITY.  Well, sentence 8 has to go to the eternal sulphur mines.


Now to select a RULE.

I will NATURALLY use the command

perl -e 'print unpack(S,`head -c 2 /dev/random`)>>5,"\n";'

Giving 1350. Nope. 197. Nope. 323. 106.


Rule 106/0 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.


Although tempting, there is LITTLE point in trying to make a sentence that
contradicts this very Rule.

I select the sentence

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.

I select the WORD "Proposals".

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

The latter sentence is inserted after the first paragraph of e Olde
Frankenstein Rule, which now reads as follows:

Rule 1671/94 (Power=1)
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      All Frankenstein Monsters made in the proper way shall be voted
      upon.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      If a Frankenstein Monster is defined as a Voting Entity then
      it is permitted to cast Voting Tokens on Proposals as if it
      were a Player.

      No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
      Frankenstein Monster, and only those Entities designated by the
      Rules to be Frankenstein Monsters are Frankenstein Monsters.

      Any Frankenstein Monster who is not Tainted is permitted to,
      once in any given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that
      e is otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in
      addition to any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own Frankenstein Monsters for
      changing its own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in
      accordance with its own Frankenstein Monsters is legal.

      Frankenstein Monsters are permitted to submit Statements for
      Judgement to the Game of InterNomic.

      A Group with fewer than three Frankenstein Monsters is not
      entitled to cast Votes.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall receive a weekly salary
      equal to 1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      There shall exist the Frankenstein Monster of Rulekeepor.

      The Notary's Report includes:

        i) The Name and class of each Frankenstein Monster.
       ii) The identities of the Administrator and Executor of each
           Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The Players within the Jurisdiction of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.
       iv) The identity of the Maintainer of each Frankenstein
           Monster's SLC.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.
