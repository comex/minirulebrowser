137. Proposal by Vlad, AI=1
Raus mit der Zeitgeist u. a.

* Rule 1047 "Patent Title of Zeitgeist" is hereby repealed.

* Amend Rule 649 to read as follows:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent
      Titles can be possessed only by persons.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such Titles which have no Historical 
      Significance. For the purposes of this Rule, any Title defined
      by the Rules to have no Historical SIgnificance has none. In
      addition, the Registrar may Act to declare any Title not
      referred to in th Rules to be without Historical Significance
      Without Objection. If such an action successfully occurs, then
      that Title also has no Historical Significance.

      This list is known as the Gold Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

144. Proposal by Steve, AI=1
Actions With Real Support

[Comment: the point of having Actions With N Supporters is surely that
the Support is supposed to come from other Players. Currently, a person
can Support their own action, which in the case of Actions With One
Supporter, is equivalent to simple authority to perform the action.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1874 (Actions With N Supporters) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the Public
          Forum supporting the change.

with text which reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players other than the Player
          intending to make the change posted to the Public Forum supporting 
	  the change.

Cleaning up the Grand Agoran Tournament

* Amend Rule 1877 "Competitions" by replacing the paragraph reading:

To be valid, an AFT must also fulfill the following conditions:
        i) The proposed Team must consist of at least three Players
       ii) No two proposed Team members may belong to the same Circle.
      iii) No proposed Team Member may belong to an already existing
           Team.
      If any of the above three conditions ceases to be true, a Team
      is immediately dissolved and removed from the current Team
      Competition.

      Competition.

* Amend Rule 1879 "Scoring" by removing the paragraph reading:

      If three consecutive CFJs are Judged TRUE, FALSE and UNDECIDED
      (in any order), to the Player making the third CFJ: 17 Points.

* Amend Rule 1875 "The Grand Agoran Tournament" by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      The Grand Agoran Tournament consists of a series of Rounds.
      These Rounds begin on the First of March, June, September, and
      October of each year, and last for three months. The first Round
      begins March 1, 1999. At the beginning of each Round, the
      Scorekeepor will draw up a list of all Active Players in
      descending order of their Scores from the preceding Round. For
      the first Round, this will be done instead in descending order
      of the Players' combined P-Note and VT holdings taken from the
      most recent Official Reports. Ties will be broken by random
      selection.

          Order, e shall do so within seven days of when the
          requirement arises.

      (b) The foregoing does not apply to any requirement to execute a

          Orders need not be executed, any Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1478 be amended to read:

      (a) The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by
          the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that
          entity.
        (1) Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir
            own Executor.
        (2) Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
            permit that entity to have an Executor, and a Certificate
            of Executorship has been filed with the Notary for that
            entity.

      (b) Before a Player may act as the Executor of an entity, e must
          file with the Notary a Certificate of Executorship.  A
          Certificate of Executorship must set out:
        (1) the entity of which the Player is the Executor;
        (2) the Player's own name; and
        (3) the authority under which that Player claims to be
            Executor of that entity.

      (c) The Notary shall maintain a record of all Certificates of
          Executorship filed with em, and shall include in eir weekly
          Report a list of every entity not a Player which has an
          Executor, and the Player named in the most recent
          Certificate of Executorship filed with em for that entity.

      (d) A person ceases to be the Executor of an entity when that
          person ceases to be a Player, any other Rule to the contrary
          notwithstanding.

      (e) The determination by an Officer that a Player was not acting
          as the Executor of an entity other than emself shall not be
          subject to judicial review, in those cases where no
          Certificate of Executorship has been filed with the Notary
          naming that Player as the Exector of the entity in question.

      (f) Any Player who files a false Certificate of Executorship
          commits a Class B Crime.  A Judge who determines that a

            the Election.
        (7) Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for
            one Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector
            outside of the Nominating Period have no effect.
        (8) Secrecy: Nominations need not be kept secret.

      (b) Announcing Candidates: the Vote Collector shall announce to

          Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for
          the Election.

      (c) If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
          Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one
          Candidate in a given Election, then that Candidate shall be
          the Winner of that Election.

      (d) In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time

        (2) Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one of the
            Candidates for the given Election. Words which are
            effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.
        (3) Adoption: The Winner of the Election is the Candidate for
            whom the most votes were cast. If there is more than one
            such candidate, the Speaker chooses one of those
            candidates as the winner, and must announce eir chosen
            candidate as winner to the Public Forum.
        (4) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
            Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a
            smaller fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      (e) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of an
          Election is not announced within one Week following the end
          of the Voting Period, the Election has no Winner.

      (f) Effective Time of Election Results: The results of an
          Election are effective at the time the results of the
          Referendum are announced; or, if there is no Referendum, at
          the time that the Vote Collector announces that there is to
          be no Referendum.

      (g) Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of
          the announced results of an Election must be made within
          seven days of the time the results are announced.  If seven
          days pass from the time the results are announced without a
          challenge, the announced results are the true results of
          that Election, whether or not they be in error in any way.

          delivers a Notice of Change of Organizational Name to the

            Policy";

          Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum.

          requires the Signature of the Executor of the entity to
          which the Will is to belong, and is Executed by submitting
          it to the Notary.  The effect of Executing such an

          Any prior Will belonging to that entity is destroyed at the
          same time.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Organization in existence prior to the adoption of the
          Proposal which created this Rule is deemed to be an
          Organization created under the authority of these Rules, all
          other Rules notwithstanding.  The Charter of each such
          Organization shall be its former SLC, the Agent shall be the

          adoption of the Proposal which created this Rule.

      (c) This Rule shall take precedence over every Rule with which
          it conflicts.

            created, is zero.
        (2) The Amendment Number of each Rule existing at the time
            this version of this Rule takes effect is whatever its
            Amendment Number was under the prior version of this Rule;

            Rule, its Amendment Number is zero.

      (c) Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
          Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
          Rule and the Rule's current text.

Reformat Rule 1434

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1434 be amended to read:

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      (a) Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
          for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the
          result. This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise
          specified.

      (b) Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
          Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
          sends eir Vote.

      (c) Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the
          Vote Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what
          Referendum e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      (d) Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
          are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      (e) Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting
          Entity may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      (f) Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot
          be changed.

      (g) Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
          first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
          begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
          Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      (h) Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.
          All Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the
          Voting Period have no effect.

      (i) Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
          while the Voting is underway.

      (j) This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
          posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of
          those Players who have already Voted.

      (k) Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
          Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
          Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as
          the name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      (l) Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes
          on a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be
          greater than Adotion Index for the Referendum to pass. If it
          is not, the Referendum fails.

      (m) Adoption Index: Unless otherwise specified, the Adoption
          Index for a Referendum is 1.

      (n) Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
          Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
          fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      (o) Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
          perform eir required duties, but if the result of a
          Referendum is not announced within one Week following the
          end of the Voting Period, it automatically fails.

      (p) Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
          in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
          into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
          Public Forum.

          review of that Order, and any portion of an Order which has
          this effect is void and without force, all other Rules
          notwithstanding.

Power to the Senate

Let it there fore be resolved that rule 1717 be amended to read:

There exist Nomic entities know as Senators, there also exists a Nomic 
entity known as the Senate.  Some Players are Senators.  The Senate is 
the set of all Senators.  Only Senators are members of the Senate.

Only players may be senators.  If a Senator is removed from the Senate, 
e ceases to be a Senator.  

A Player who has been registered continuously for the immediately 
preceding two months becomes a Senator, if and only if e has not been a 
Senator at any point during those two months.

There are always at least three Senators.  If at any point there is less 
than three Senators, the registered player, who is not a Senator, and 
who has not been a Senator for the longest period of time amongst the 
registered players, becomes a Senator.  If it is impossible to tell 
which player has not been a Senator for the longest period of time, then 
all players, who arguable share the longest period of time not being a 
Senator, become Senators.

Any Senator may choose to remove themselves from the Senate, by stating 
so in a public forum.



Create a new rule titled "Senator Suggestions" with the following title:

A Senate Suggestion is a piece of text sent to a public forum by a 
Senator.  It must state clearly that it is a Senate Suggestion and 
contain a valid Suggestion, or it fails to be a Senate Suggestion.

Only Senators may make Senate Suggestions.  Senate Suggestions may be 
made only as defined by the rules.  A Senate must contain all the 
information needed, as defined by the rules, or it fails to be a Senate 
Suggestion.

Any Senator may object to a Senate Suggestion, by making a Senator 
Objection.  Senate Objections must be made in a public forum, making 
clear the suggestion they object to, and that in fact the text is a 
Senator Objection.



Create a new rule titled "Senate Powers" with the following text:

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a registered player becomes 
a Senator.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
player in the Suggestion.  The player becomes a Senator one week after 
the suggestion, unless there is a Senator Objection to the suggestion 
within the week.

A Senator may make a Senate Suggestion, that a Senator is removed from 
the Senate.  To do so there must be a clear indication of the intended 
Senator in the Suggestion.  The Senator is removed from the Senate one 
week after the suggestion, unless there are at least 2 Senator 
Objections to the suggestion within the week.



Create a rule titled "Senate Proposals" with the following text:

At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, a Senator may make it a 
Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.  If that does not 
happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.  

A Senator may object to the proposal becoming a Senate Proposal by 
stating so in the public forum during the Proposals Voting Period, in 
which case the proposal ceases to be a Senate Proposal, and returns to 
its previous state.

If a Senator objects to a proposal Senate Proposal, that Proposal may 
not become a Senate proposal again.

Entities other than Senators cannot vote on Senate Proposals. If an 
Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a Proposal by the time

      the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and its
      other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      entity is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is executed,
      the Executor in Probate of that entity will first execute all
      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever
      reason), and will then divide the remaining residual assets as
      provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the Signature of
      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1727 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, as close to Agora's Birthday as
      possible, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank, execute
      transfers of 3 VTs to each Player;

and by replacing the paragraph reading:

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

with a paragraph reading

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, execute transfers for one P-note each from the Bank to
      each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these transfers
      to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday ends;

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1730 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1732 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is only satisfied when a transfer to the payee
      of that Payment Order for the currency and amount named in that
      Payment Order is successfully executed, provided that, when that
      transfer was executed, its executor clearly indicated that that
      transfer was being executed for the purpose of satisfying the
      Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given transfer may be used for the purpose of satisfying at
      most one Payment Order.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or CFJ.
      However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player makes
      such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when
      specifically required by the Rules to execute a transfer), e
      commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and upon
      conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1817 be amended to read:

      A Recordkeepor is required to record all valid transfers
      executed by the Executor of the owner of the units of Currency
      to be transferred (or, with respect to any entity which lacks an
      Executor, by any other person empowered by the Rules to execute
      transfers on the behalf of such entities), except for those
      transfers which would result in an entity possessing a negative
      quantity of Currency. Transfers shall be noted on the
      Recordkeepor's records in the order in which they are received
      by the Recordkeepor.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1818 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1739 be amended, by replacing the
paragraph reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

with one reading

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring the
      execution of a transfer of those Units of Currency from the
      entity in Probate to that Entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1820 be amended to read:

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all transfers
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1823 be amended to read:

      If a Player is required to execute two or more Payment Orders,
      all of which name the same Payor, Payee, and Currency, that
      Player may elect to instead execute one Payment Order naming
      that Payor, Payee and Currency, and for an amount equal to the
      sum of all such Payment Orders required.  Doing so satisfies by
      substitution the requirement to execute all such Payment Orders.

      This Rule may not be applied with respect to any Payment Order
      required consequent to the vacation or stay of another Payment
      Order.

      Payment Orders to be executed for the purpose of paying for
      Voting upon Proposals may not be combined by this Rule with
      Payment Orders executed for any other purpose.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1757 be amended to read:

      (a) The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to execute
          on behalf of that entity whatever transfers are necessary to
          implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's
          Estate, as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee
          may also execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to
          implement the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      (b) The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when
          implementing a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the
          entity in Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      (c) The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee
          when:
        (1) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        (2) e ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
            or
        (4) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      (d) An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its
          Trustee announces the completion of the implementation of a
          Plan for the disposition of the Estate of that entity.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1596 be amended to read:

      A Payment Order is an Order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      execute a transfer transferring units of a Currency from itself
      to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order specifies
      exactly one source entity, exactly one destination entity,
      exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that Currency
      which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1598 be amended to read:

      (a) A transfer is valid if:
        (1) the entity executing it is the Executor of the entity from
            which the transfer is to be made, or if that entity has no
            Executor, such other Player as is authorized to execute
            transfers on behalf of that entity;
        (2) the transfer is denominated in exactly one Currency;
        (3) the amount transferred is a positive multiple of that
            Currency's MUQ;
        (4) the entity from which the transfer is to be made, prior to
            that transfer, possesses at least that many units of that
            Currency; and
        (5) if the transfer purports to be executed to satisfy a
            particular Payment, that Payment Order exists and is
            capable of being satisfied by that transfer.

      (b) A transfer is executed by submitting a Transfer Notice to
          the Recordkeepor of the Currency in which it is denominated;
          this Notice shall set forth:
        (1) the entity from which the transfer is being made;
        (2) the entity to which the transfer is being made;
        (3) the Currency involved;
        (4) the number of units of Currency being transferred; and
        (5) the purpose of the transfer, if specification of the
            purpose of the transfer is necessary to meet with the

123. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Eliminate Transfer Orders

Be it resolved, that Rule 1799 be amended to read:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.  Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow.  In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

      Otherwise, an Order shall not be amended, stayed, vacated, or
      otherwise changed once executed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1637 be amended to read:

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.

      the transfers required by the Will (excepting those which e
      cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for whatever

      the Executor of the entity to which the Will is to belong, and
      is Executed by submitting it to the Notary.  The effect of
      Executing such an Application is to create a Will belonging to
      that entity.  Any prior Will belonging to that entity is
      destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

      If the Chancellor executes a transfer from the Bank for any

"ABSTAIN" on this proposal.   In this case the number of voting tokens 
paid out by the registrar to each player will be the number of votes 
they cast on this proposal multiplied by the voting tariff at the time 
of this proposal being adopted.

Give The Rulesets Dates

Be it therefore resolved, that Rule 1681 be amended to read:

There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

The SLR must contain:
*The date that it was last changed, or modified.

The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
* The Rule Number
* The Rule's Amendment Number
* The Rule's Power
* The Rule's Title
* The Rule's text
* Any annotations to the Rule required by Order

The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
the readability of the SLR.

There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
same Category and presented in the same order as in the
SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
to be in the SLR, as well as:

Also the FLR must contain;
* A brief description of each Category
* Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
required to record.

The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
FLR.

          grant of Power of Attorney for another Player (hereinafter
          the Grantor) is, for the duration of that grant, the
          Executor of the Grantor, and may act in the Grantor's behalf
          for as long as the Grantee lawfully holds the Power of

        (2) the dates upon which the grant shall begin and end.

      (c) A Player may grant Power of Attorney to another Player only
          if:
        (1) the Grantor has been continuously registered for the two
            months immediately prior to the announcement;
        (2) the Grantee is a Player and is not on Hold at the time of

        (2) the Grantor ceases to be a Player;
        (3) the Grantee fails to consent, by Public Forum

        (4) the grant's specified period expires;
        (5) the Grantee grants Power of Attorney to anyone else; or
        (6) the Grantor cancels the grant, by Public Forum

      (e) For the purpose of subdivision (a), the term "privilege,
          duty, or power of any Office" includes those of the Speaker,
          and those of a Judge or Justice, with respect to a Grantor
          who holds any of these positions.

Append the following paragraph to Rule 1497 ("Truth in Advertising"):

      This Rule shall not apply to messages posted during April 1,
      GMT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

140. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=2
Unlimited Voting

Be it resolved, that Rule 206 be amended to read:

      (a) A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized
          by the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal.  Other
          Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity
          in specific circumstances without that Entity thereby
          ceasing to be a Voting Entity.  Only those Entities
          designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
          Entities.

      (b) No Entity is permitted to vote on a Proposal unless it is a
          Voting Entity.

      (c) Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified, each Voting Entity may cast an
          unlimited number of Votes on a Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that Rules 1660, 1765 and 1465 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1442 be amended, by appending a
paragraph reading, "If the voting cost for a Proposal is zero, then
each Voting Entity may cast only one Vote on that Proposal."

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

141. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1

Be it resolved, that Rules 1048 and 1691 be repealed.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, with Power 1, to read:

      (a) A new Rule shall be assigned to:
        (1) the Rule Category specified by the Instrument that created
            the Rule, if that Rule Category exists; otherwise
        (2) a Rule Category chosen by the Rulekeepor at eir
            discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (b) The Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (c) The Rulekeepor may delete an empty Rule Category at eir
          discretion, by Public Forum Announcement.

      (d) The Rulekeepor may change the name of a Rule Category
          Without Objection.

      (e) The Rulekeepor may change the Rule Category to which a given
          Rule is assigned Without Objection.

[ Comment: Rules 1691 and 1048 are somewhat redundant in their present
  form.  This proto seeks to eliminate the redundancy and clean up
  things a bit. ]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

142. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Merit

Be it resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Each Player has a Merit Rating, an integer, which may be
          positive, negative, or zero.  Until the Rules act to give a
          Player some other Merit Rating, a Player's Merit Rating is
          zero.  Merit Ratings shall be changed only when authorized
          by the Rules.

      (b) The Office of the Secretary is hereby established.
        (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of the Merit Rating
            of every Player.
        (2) The Secretary's Report shall include:
          (A) a schedule setting forth the Merit Rating of each
              Player; and
          (B) a description of all changes made to the Merit Rating of
              any Player since the last such Report.
        (3) The Secretary shall receive a salary equal to one and
            one-half times the Basic Officer Salary.

      (c) When an entitlement is to be randomly distributed to the
          Players, the Officer making the distribution shall use the
          following procedure (or any other procedure which results in
          each Player having the same probability of receiving the
          entitlement as e would under the following procedure):
        (1) The Officer shall, for each Player, place in a bin one
            hundred tokens bearing the name of that Player, in each
            case augmenting or diminishing that number by that
            Player's Merit Rating.  (If a Player's Merit Rating is
            less than negative one hundred, then no tokens are placed
            in the bin.)
        (2) The Officer shall then draw one token from the bin, and
            award the entitlement to the Player whose name is on the
            token.

      (d) When making a distribution the procedure described in
          subdivision (c), the Officer shall use the Merit Ratings of
          the Players reported in the most recent uncontested
          Secretary's Report, and no other.  A distribution made based
          on Merit Ratings as required by this subdivision is valid
          notwithstanding any error in the Secretary's Report which
          may later become apparent.
        (1) If the most recent uncontested Secretary's Report is more
            than twenty-one days old, the Officer may elect to delay
            the distribution until a new Report is made.  If the
            Officer elects to delay a distribution, e must announce in
            the Public Forum that e has elected to do so.
        (2) If there has never been an uncontested Secretary's Report,
            the Officer shall proceed on the assumption that every
            Player has a Merit Rating of zero.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

143. Proposal by Peekee, AI=1
The Scam? What Scam?

Create a rule with the title "Scam proposals" with the following text.


Let there be a type of proposal know as a Scam Proposal.
A proposal becomes a scam proposal if and only if:

(1) The Proposal contains (or contained) in its title the words "The 
Scam".
(2) The Proposal has been adopted.
(3) The Proposal was voted upon after the 15th of March 1999

As soon as possible after a proposal becomes a Scam Proposal the 
registrar shall pay out 1 P-Note and a number of Voting Tokens, to any 
player who cast a valid vote of "ABSTAIN" on the proposal.  In this case 
the number of voting tokens paid out by the registrar to each player 
will be the number of votes they cast on the proposal multiplied by the 
voting tariff at the time of the proposal being adopted.

This rule will repeal itself one week after it is created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

145. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Cooperation is a Good Thing

Be it resolved, that Rule 1771 be amended, by replacing the paragraph
reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by an amount equal
      to the number of P-Notes transferred to the Bank, provided that
      this transfer is not executed for any other purpose.

with one reading

      The Priority of the Proposal is increased or decreased, as
      specified by the Player making the payment, by:
      (a) an amount equal to one-half the number of P-Notes
          transferred to the Bank, if the transferor was the Proposer
          of that Proposal, or
      (b) an amount equal to the number of P-Notes transferred to the
          Bank, otherwise;
      provided that this transfer is not executed for any other
      purpose.

[ This gives Players an incentive to get other people to pay to
  advance their Proposals in the Proposal Queue. ]

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1701 be amended, by replacing "The
MUQ of P-Notes is 0.1." with "The MUQ of P-Notes is 0.01."


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

146. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Taxes, revisited

Be it resolved, that Rule 1735 be amended to read:

      (a) The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.

      (b) As soon as possible after a Payment Order is executed for
          which the Bank is the payor, the Chancellor shall either (as
          the Bank's Executor) satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute
          it by making a COE or CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not
          do so if another Player makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      (c) If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for
          any reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except
          when specifically required by the Rules to submit a Transfer
          Order), e commits the Class A Crime of Misappropriation, and
          upon conviction of this Crime shall be removed from Office.

      (d) The Chancellor may (as the Bank's Executor) Mint new units
          of Currency of which the Bank is the Mintor, Without
          Objection.  The Bank may not otherwise Mint units of
          Currency.

      (e) For each Currency minted by the Bank, at most once in each
          month, the Chancellor may levy a tax on that Currency.  The
          amount of this tax shall not exceed fifty percent.  The
          Chancellor may exempt units of Currency from this taxation,
          provided that the exemptions are:
        (1) the same among all Players;
        (2) the same among all non-Players; and
        (3) at least as great with respect to Players as with
            non-Players.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1853 be amended to read:

      (a) When (and only when) an Officer is empowered to levy a tax
          on a Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the
          Public Forum.

      (b) Taxes may be levied only when the Rules explicitly permit
          it, and then only by the Officer authorized to impose that
          levy.

      (c) An Officer levies a tax by announcing it in a Public Forum.
          An announcement of levy must specify:
        (1) The Currency being taxed;
        (2) the amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage;
        (3) any exemptions from the levy; and
        (4) the legal authorization for the levy.

      (d) As soon as possible after the announcement of a tax levy
          conforming with subdivision (c) of this Rule, the
          Recordkeepor of the Currency in which the tax is levied
          shall compute the amount of tax owed by each taxable entity,
          and issue Payment Orders requiring each such entity to pay
          eir tax to the Bank.

      (e) The amount of tax levied on a taxable entity is the
          announced percentage of that entity's holdings of the
          Currency being taxed, using the amount of that Currency
          owned by that entity at the time the announcement was made,
          and shall exclude any amount which the legal authorization
          of that specific tax levy allows to be excluded from
          taxation.

      (f) Subdivision (e) of this Rule notwithstanding, the amount of
          tax levied on a particular entity may not exceed fifty
          percent of that entity's holdings unless the legal
          authorization of the specific tax levy explicitly permits
          it.

      (g) The Bank is not a taxable entity.  All other entities are.

Be it further resolved, that Rule 1852 be repealed.

[ This changes taxes to be real taxes: now, they are used by the
  Chancellor to raise revenue so as to be able to pay the Bank's
  debts. The exemption language allows the Chancellor to tax 50% of VT
  holdings above 5 VT, or 20% of VT holdings above 4 VTs for Players
  or 2 VTs for non-Players, but not above 4 VTs for Players or 6 VTs
  for non-Players.

  In order to encourage Chancellors to adopt sound fiscal policy, the
  power to mint Currencies is curtailed to "Without Objection"; a
  Chancellor who fails to ensure that e has enough funds in the
  Treasury will face Persistent Indebtedness penalties. ]



----------------------------------------------------------------------------

147. Proposal by General Chaos, AI=1
Let the Promotor Exercise
Judgment

Be it resolved, that Rule 1483 be amended to read:

      (a) A Proposal is any document clearly marked as such.

      (b) A Proposal is Proposed when it is posted by a Proposing
          Entity to the Public Forum with the clear indication that it
          is being posted for the purpose of Proposing it.

      (c) A Proposal is not Proposed if, in the Promotor's judgment,
          it is substantially identical to another Proposal Proposed
          within the past three weeks, unless
        (1) the Proposing Entity posting the Proposal clearly
            indicates at the time of posting that the Proposal is
            intended to become a duplicate of the prior Proposal, or
        (2) the prior Proposal has been discarded or withdrawn, or has
            been distributed and the results of voting upon that
            Proposal have been announced by the Assessor.

      (d) The Promotor's determination that a Proposal has or has not
          been Proposed (including a determination made under
          subdivision (c) of this Rule) is subject to judicial review
          only for abuse of discretion.

      (e) Under no circumstance shall the Promotor's distribution of
          previously undistributed Proposals constitute the submission
          of a new Proposal.

Be it further resolved, that a Rule be enacted, to read:

      (a) Any CFJ which alleges that an Officer made an error
          regarding a determination of fact where the Rules state that
          such determinations shall be subject to judicial review only
          for abuse of discretion lacks standing and shall be
          dismissed.  (Such CFJs, to have standing, must allege that
          the Officer in question abused discretion in making the
          disputed determination.)

      (b) This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining
          to when a CFJ has standing, and over all other Rules which
          specify when a CFJ shall be dismissed.

Raus mit der Zeitgeist u. a.

* Rule 1047 "Patent Title of Zeitgeist" is hereby repealed.

* Amend Rule 649 to read as follows:

      There is a class of entities known as Patent Titles.  Patent
      Titles can be possessed only by persons.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Patent Titles that
      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such Titles which have no Historical 
      Significance. For the purposes of this Rule, any Title defined
      by the Rules to have no Historical SIgnificance has none. In
      addition, the Registrar may Act to declare any Title not
      referred to in th Rules to be without Historical Significance
      Without Objection. If such an action successfully occurs, then
      that Title also has no Historical Significance.

      This list is known as the Gold Pages, and is part of the
      Registrar's Report.

Actions With Real Support

[Comment: the point of having Actions With N Supporters is surely that
the Support is supposed to come from other Players. Currently, a person
can Support their own action, which in the case of Actions With One
Supporter, is equivalent to simple authority to perform the action.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1874 (Actions With N Supporters) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players posted to the Public
          Forum supporting the change.

with text which reads:

      (b) between the two posts, N or more Players other than the Player
          intending to make the change posted to the Public Forum supporting 
	  the change.
