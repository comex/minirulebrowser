Agora Nomic
Ambassador's Report

Date of this Report: 2 Mar 1998

======================================================================
Diplomatic Report


Results of INP 361, 362: rejected.
=================================

Acka voted for both, we voted against (both in time to influence IN's
vote, which therefore was an abstention). New Rishonnomic tried to
vote against both, but apparently did so too late.

[Reminder: INP 361 was to make .Nomic a voting member. The nomic still
seems to be alive and playing.

INP 362 was an attempt to avoid selecting IN as judge.

    Herald, lastly I transfer one Kudo from myself to Time Agent. I transfer it

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
