		"Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate."

======================================================================

Judge:       Blob (defaulted)

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe,

  Oerjan judges TRUE, 28 Oct 1997 21:31:09 +0100 (MET)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I judge TRUE.

As the Caller argues, no Rule requires an EiP to remain a Player after e
has been selected.

Warning! This CFJ contains Injunctions!

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1061

   Rule 1585 should be interpreted such that a Player who is newly 
 installed into an Office does not commit the Infraction of Failure to 
 Report (insofar as that Office is subject to such duties) if e posts 
 the required Report within a week of eir being installed into Office.

  Assigned to Steve, 30 Oct 1997 14:49:06 +0100 (MET)
  Judged TRUE by Steve, 2 Nov 1997 14:10:44 +1100 (EST)

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1686 designates the Infraction of Failure to Report as the
"failure to post the Official Report", an action that the same Rule
requires the Officer to perform "at least once every Nomic Week". 
Thus, at the beginning of a Nomic Week, the current holder of an 
Office immediately incurs this obligation, which is only lifted when 
the report is published.

When a new Officer is installed in that same Office (assuming that 
the Officer is a different Player), that duty becomes attached to the 
new Officer; further, Rule 1585 dictates that the timing requirements 
under which that duty must be fulfilled become those of ASAP. Rule 
1585 at Power 2 takes precedence over 1686, which conflicts with it 
in attempting to impose a different timing requirement ("at least 
once a week").

It is the *holder* of an Office that is the target of the Infraction, 
not the "Office as a whole" as Kolja quaintly puts it. I would argue 
that if the obligation pertains to the Office rather than the Player, 
the Infraction should be incurred by the Office too. ;)

I ask that the Judge issue an Injunction to Annotate Rule 1585 with 
the attached Statement and list of Relevant Rules.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In the matter of CFJ 1061, I judge that the Statement is TRUE. The
Caller's arguments are persuasive.

I believe it was Crito who suggested that the Statement might be
trivially false because a Player newly installed into Office might
violate ASAP by posting eir Report out of order, even though within
the week. But Morendil's rebuttal is incisive: in that case, the
Player would be guilty of Tardiness, but not of Failure to Report.

======================================================================

Injunctions:

Firstly, I hereby grant Morendil's request for an Injunction to Annotate,
and enjoin the Rulekeepor to Annotate R1585 with the Statement and the list
of Relevant Rules.

Secondly, and as required by R1504, I hereby issue an Injunction enjoining
the Clerk of the Courts to vacate the Payment Orders, executed by then-
Registrar Zefram in his 'Salary Report 1997-W43', penalizing Kolja and
Steve for Failure to Report.

======================================================================

Evidence:

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

In the matter of CFJ 1058, I find the Statement to be FALSE.

There is yet considerable doubt in my mind as to the proper number of
Infractions which should have been imposed against Morendil for his
recent flagrant abuse of judicial power.  However, the penalty imposed
by an Infraction is binding whether or not imposed properly, and it is
clear that Andre, as Clerk of the Courts, did impose sufficient
penalties to give Morendil in excess of 30 Blots.  Whether Andre did
so properly need not be addressed in the instant matter; propriety is
simply not an issue.  To the best of my understanding, Morendil did
indeed have at least 31 Blots at the time of elJefe's allegation, and
thus elJefe's allegation is correct, and no Crime was committed.

Judgement of FALSE is entered.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

I hereby reverse Michael's Judgement and find that the Statement is
FALSE.

Although I completely agree with Michael's reasoning concerning how
Harlequin's message should have been interpreted, the fact is that
Michael's Judgement was made without reference to the possibility
that Harlequin's attempts to transfer VTs might have failed to
satisfy any Payment Orders simply because Harlequin, like every other
Player, had no VTs at the time, a consequence of the destruction of
Voting Tokens by P3533.

I am not aware of any other occasion on which General Chaos has
wrongfully denied a COE, so I conclude that the Statement, despite
its generality, is FALSE.

Speaker Steve

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

FALSE (overturning the original Judgement)

General Chaos is being too picky here, but the question is, should the COE
have been admitted?  Morendil's claim essentially says that Harlequin's
Transfer Orders of 20 September did satisfy the indicated Payment Orders,
when the General said they did not.

According to Rule 1732, a PO can only be satisfied when the appropriate TO
is successfully executed and the amount named is correct.  According to
Rule 1598, this could only happen if Harlequin had enough VTs.  As CFJ 933
has established, on 20 September nobody had any VTs.  Thus the TOs could
not have satisfied the POs, as claimed (though for reasons other than the
ones given).

In my reading of Rule 1431, the essence of the response to a COE is the
denial or acceptance (and in the latter case, posting of the corrected
portion of the report).  Rule 1431 does _not_ require the respondent to
post reasons and arguments.

Therefore, denying a claim for the wrong reason does not constitute
Wrongful COE Denial, if the claim should have been denied for other
reasons.  This is mostly a good thing; for an Officer it should be enough
to get the decision right, without having to make sure the reasons are
perfect too.

Thus I vote to overturn the judgement, and rule that the CFJ should be
judged FALSE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

In the case of CFJ 1047 I UPHOLD the Judgement of TRUE.

It has been argued by some, notably General Chaos, that the COE
that Morendil made was rightfully denied, as Harlequin did not
actually transfer 4 VTs to the Bank, so e did also not actually
satisfy the Payment Orders. However, what does the post in question
of General Chaos actually say? General Chaos writes:

  Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
  VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.

  The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

Thus, in my opinion, General Chaos does not only claim that the
POs are not satisfied, but he also claims that transferring 4 VTs
to the Bank would not satisfy them. Which, as the Judge has, in my
opinion rightly, decided, is not the case. Thus the message was in
fact misrepenting the Gamestate in that it misrepresented the effect
transferring 4 VTs to the Bank would have been able to have, had it 
actually taken place.

By the way, have the other Justices really checked all of General
Chaos's other denied COE's to check whether he did not happen to
commit the Crime on some other time...? If not they would have done
better to dismiss the CFJ than to have changed the Judgement to
FALSE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning second Judge:

After reviewing all of the evidence, one point sticks out that simply
cannot be ignored.  Justice Andre argued that General Chaos claimed that
transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or VT1041,
both POs being for the amount of 2VTs each.  This statement misrepresents
the actual game state.  By denying the COE which alleged as such, General
Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a class 1 crime which
bears a penalty of 1 Blot.

I hereby find this CFJ to be TRUE.

Since this CFJ was reassigned, Michael's original Injunction had no effect.

I hereby issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalize General Chaos for this
Crime. 

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker, second Appeal:

I had hoped to delay my Judgement of this Appeal until after the passage
of my proposed amendment to R1693, which would prevent a third, and
very tedious, re-assignment of this CFJ in the event of another split
decision. But the VP for P3573 won't conclude until the early morning
of Fri, 31 Oct, Melbourne time, and CotC Andre's prompt distribution
of the Appeal means that my Judgement is due before then. Ah, the
privileges of Office. Since there is no point delaying, I may as well
be prompt.

Predictably, I overturn Judge Vir's decision and find the Statement
FALSE.

What neither Judge Vir, nor Justice Andre in his first decision as
Appeal Justice (whom Vir followed in making his Judgement), have
considered, which properly they ought to do, is that it's clear from
R1431 that an Officer's reasons for denying a COE are irrelevant
in determining whether eir decision to deny a COE was correct. As
Justice elJefe points out in his first Appeal Judgement, this is
as it should be.

Harlequin's original message stated: "I transfer 4 VTs to the Bank,
to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041". General Chaos denied that this
message constituted Transfer Orders satisfying the POs mentioned.
In this he was completely correct. Harlequin did not have 4 VTs at
the time he sent the message, and so no message of his sent at that
time could have satisfied those POs. That is all we need to know in
order to determine that General Chaos was correct to deny the COE.


======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar, second Appeal:

I vote to overturn and find the Statement FALSE.  My reasons are
the same as I offered in a previous decision.

Justice Andre made much of the fact that General Chaos had interpreted
the TO in question as a single one for 4 TVs as opposed to 2 TOs for 2 VTs
each.  I cannot find any reason why the latter interpretation is
unambiguously specified by the message, since neither one was
a performable Transfer Order at the time.  Further, I interpret
Morendil's COE as referring to the statement that the PO was not satisfied.

The Statement in question does not say that Gen. Chaos committed an
error in presenting the game state.  It refers specifically to COE's,
and while the General may have made an error in interpreting and
reporting, e did not err in denying the COE. Nor is any other evidence
in sight that e has committed wrongful COE denial in the past.

"Chaos" == Chaos Harlequin <harlequin@tmbg.org writes:

Chaos I transfer 4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041.

Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.

The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

This strikes me as extremely ridiculous - insofar as the above can
reasonably be interpreted as two TOs of 2 VTs each, satisfying one
of the named POs each, in the spirit of the Appeals Court's decision
on CFJ 940, I fail to see why there should be any difficulty in
accepting that these TOs satisfy the named POs.

I quote from the Speaker's decision in that matter :

   All that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable
   as conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the
   Payment Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable
   certainty, either from being explicitly stated within that message,
   or reasonably deducible from the context in which that message was
   sent.

I see no reason why any of the above should not apply equally well to 
Transfer Orders. Please note that this is a COE.
