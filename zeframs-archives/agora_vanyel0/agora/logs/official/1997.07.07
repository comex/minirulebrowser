The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

As far as I know, no Herald's Report has ever been subject to
the adoption of a VOC directive.

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Frankenstein Monster.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

- I randomly selected the following Rule :

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System is Protected

- I chose the following sentence:

      Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

- I chose the word "condition".
- The folowing sentence is inserted after the first paragraph of Rule 1671:

   Any change to the game state which would result in this Frankenstein Monster
   becoming false is cancelled and does not take place, any Rule to the 
   contrary notwithstanding.

[Comment: was there a CFJ which established that the Frankenstein Rule is
the same as the Frankenstein Monster, in which case the above might have 
interesting consequences, or is my memory playing tricks on me ?]

* Changes for week of July 7

- There were 12 sentences.
- I randomly selected two sentences : 9 1
- I chose to delete the 9th sentence :

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Frankenstein Monster
      resulting from that act.

- I randomly selected the following Rule :

Rule 1721/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor

- I chose the following sentence:

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Currency
      which exists, detailing for each Currency the Name, Mintor,
      Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Currency.

- I chose the word "Currency".
- The folowing sentence is inserted after the first paragraph of Rule 1671:

   The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Frankenstein Monster
   which exists, detailing for each Frankenstein Monster the Name, Mintor,
   Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Frankenstein Monster. 

* The Frankenstein Rule now reads as follows :

Rule 1671
The Frankenstein Rule

      There is a Nomic Entity known as a Frankenstein Monster.  A
      Frankenstein Monster only has properties and effects as defined
      in this Rule.  This Rule shall be known as the Frankenstein
      Rule, and can be referred to unambiguously in that manner.  This
      is the first paragraph.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Frankenstein 
      Monster which exists, detailing for each Frankenstein Monster the
      Name, Mintor, Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Frankenstein Monster. 

      Any change to the game state which would result in this Frankenstein 
      Monster becoming false is cancelled and does not take place, any Rule to 
      the contrary notwithstanding.

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Frankenstein Monster who makes further play impossible by eir
      actions or lack thereof commits the Crime of Frankenstein
      Monster Impossibility, a Class A Crime.

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Frankenstein Monster, only existing by
      virtue of the Frankenstein Monster defining it to exist.

      Frankenstein Monster is 2.

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider
      Frankenstein Monster custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and
      the best interests of the Frankenstein Monster before applying
      other standards.

      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits an Infraction, to
      be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and bearing a penalty of
      2 Frankenstein Monsters.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Frankenstein Monster, a
      Class C Crime.

      If that Player's Frankenstein Monster contains at least five Mil
      for each Blot to be removed, then that number of Mil is
      transferred from the Player's Frankenstein Monster, and the
      Blots are removed; otherwise, no Mil are transferred and no
      Blots are removed.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different
      Frankenstein Monster for reporting a certain transfer or class
      of transfers.

      The Frankenstein Monster shall make all random determinations
      required by the Rules except when the Rules specify another
      party to make the determination.

      This is the last paragraph. This Rule can only be subject to a
      Rule Change as described by the Frankenstein Generator.  This
      Rule takes precedence over all other Rules that would otherwise
      allow this Rule to be changed in any manner whatsoever.

[Hmm, does 18:41:08 +0200 mean 20:41:08 UTC, or 16:41:08 UTC?  I think
 that affects whether Kolja A.'s registration precedes or follows Crito's
 joining Agoraverse Tag.  Fortunately, it makes no substantive difference.]

Text of Adopted Proposals
=============================================================================

Proposal 3527 (Oerjan) (Silly, AI=2)

There exists an imbalance. To correct this inanity,
This Rule is created, enTitled "Insanity":

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and professor.

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3528 (Steve)
Allow Corrections to Follow Admissions

[Comment: R1431 currently requires corrections to be issued in the same
message as admissions of error. This is annoying. The deeming in the
new paragraph means I don't have to mess around redefining the Infraction
of Delayed COE Response, or define a new Infraction of Failing to Issue
a Correction to an Admitted COE. Note also that admitting a claim does
not reset the clock, giving you a whole extra week to issue a correction.
If you're going to admit a claim, you still have to make the admission
and issue a correction within a week of the time the COE is made.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1431 be amended by replacing in it
the text which currently reads:

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim, or an admission of the
      Claim, which shall then include a corrected version of the
      portion of the relevant message which was in error.  

with text which reads:

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of the
      Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making the
      admission is required to post a corrected version of the relevant 
      portion of the message which was in error, before one week passes
      from the time the Claim of Error was made. A Player who admits
      a Claim but does not publish a correction is deemed not to have
      Responded to that Claim.

Proposal 3529 (Steve)
Make the Wizard an Office

Be it hereby resolved that R1543 be amended to read:

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
       iii) The change in Style, if any, merited by each Proposal
            distributed since the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The reasons for each change.

Be it further resolved that Rules 1609 and 1610 be repealed.

Be it further resolved that the newly created Office of Wizard be 
held temporarily by whomever occupied the old position of Wizard
at the time this Proposal took effect.

[Comment: I've wanted to do this for a long time, but was constrained
by my desire to hang on to Wizard Transitions in their current form.
That would have meant non-trivial tinkering with the Officer Rules
to allow for Offices to be held in the normal fashion without an
Election being held. But I've had a change of heart: Wizard Transition
is not that great. R1609 is clunky is would need a serious rewrite
anyway; better just to get rid of it. There's no reason not to Elect
the Wizard just like any other Office. As a bonus, R1543 gets nicely
streamlined, thanks to the Officer defaults in Rules 1006, 1007 and 1686.]

With the passage of P3529, the position of Wizard has now become the
Office of Wizard. The Proposal attempts to install Zefram, who is
On Hold, as temporary Wizard, but I take it that this move is blocked
by R1584. R1006 then steps in to install the Speaker, General Chaos,
as temporary Wizard.

At any rate, the Office is being held temporarily, and it is my duty
as Registrar to conduct an Election to fill the Office in the normal
fashion. I therefore call for Nominations for the Office of Wizard.
The Nominating Period shall last one week, commencing as of this
message.

Registrar Steve
