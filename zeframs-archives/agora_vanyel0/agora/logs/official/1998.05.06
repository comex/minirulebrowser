History:
  Called by Morendil, Tue, 5 May 1998 15:06:12 +0100
  Assigned to Michael, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Rule states "Any Player who *is* Rebellious continually for a
period in excess of one month" (emphasis mined), not "Any Player who
has been". Further, the clause "upon the report of the Infraction the
Player becomes Abiding" seems to indicate that the report of the
Infraction must occur when the relevant Player is still Rebellious.

Further, I note that Infractions are defined thusly :

Rule 1812/0 (Power=1)
Notices of Infraction

      Any entity who performs an action defined by the Rules to be an
      Infraction, or fails to perform an action where such failure is
      defined by the Rules to be an Infraction, shall be subject to
      whatever penalty the Rules prescribe for that Infraction upon a
      Notice of Infraction stating that e committed that Infraction.

Infractions are of two kinds : actions and failures to perform an
action. The determination of penalties for is as defined as follows :

Rule 1814/0 (Power=1)
Timing of Penalties for Crimes and Infractions

      The punishment for a Crime or Infraction shall be whatever was
      specified by the Rules at the time the action so designated as a
      Crime or an Infraction was committed, even if the Rule or Rules
      which specified the punishment, or which designated the action
      as a Crime or Infraction, have since been amended or repealed.

If the Infraction of Inciting to Riot results from "performing an
action", it is therefore clear that I am not subject to any penalties;
the only action that I performed that could be relevant was Rebelling,
and at the time I did that no penalties were defined.

If that Infraction results from "failure to perform an action", the
issue becomes a little more complex. The action I putatively failed to
perform was to switch from Rebellious to Abiding within some
prescribed period. The Riot Act defines this period to be one
continous month; however I question that this period can be considered
to have started as of the time I became Rebellious.

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

     [...]

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

The Riot Act was not "available" to any Player at the time I last
became Rebellious, so I could not at that time have become required to
switch back to Abiding within one month.

I further question, no matter which interpretation is correct, that I
'failed to perform' the action required of me under the Riot act. At
the time of Michael's alleged Notice of Infraction, any such failure
had been corrected by my becoming Abiding again.
