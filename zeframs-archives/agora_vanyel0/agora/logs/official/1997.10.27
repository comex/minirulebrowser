OFF:  New Proposals: 3577-3578

There are two new proposals distributed as of this report.

======================================================================
D = Disinterested
d = Disowned
S = Silly
E = Emergency
 
D  3577 Zefram   1 Fix Lawlessness
D  3578 Steve    1 Straighten out Absence 

======================================================================
Proposal 3577 (Zefram)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Lawlessness

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") be amended by
replacing the paragraph

      A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than 30 Blots.

with

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that number
      of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than
      30 Overdue Blots.
 
======================================================================
Proposal 3578 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Straighten out Absence

[Comment: the last piece of the puzzle: 'Absence' itself must become
'Silence' (or, rather, 'Absent' must become 'Silent') to complete the
series suggested by 'Noisy' and 'Quiet'. I have kept the title of the
Proposal as 'Straighten out Absence' to reflect its origins, but changed
the Title of the Rule.]

[Comment: in the end, the amendment to R1016 that actually puts the
definition of 'Active' and 'Inactive' back in R1016 can remain separate,
since we all agree that 'Active' already has this definition by game
custom. Zefram's proto to amend R1016 handles this handsomely. This
version differs from Zefram's only in minor details: I prefer 'two
months' to 'eight weeks'; I have the Registrar make an announcement
if the deregistration does not occur for some reason; I include a
requirement that the Registrar note transitions between being Noisy,
Quiet and Silent.]

Be it hereby resolved that the Title of Rule 1042 be changed to
'Deregistration due to Silence', and that it be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 1042 are Steve and Zefram.

The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.
