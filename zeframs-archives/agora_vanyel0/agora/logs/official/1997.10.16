In the Appeal of CFJ 1014 I hereby rule that Chuck's decision
was incorrect, insofar as he did not legally dismiss the CFJ 
in accordance with the requirements of R1565, for one of the 
reasons set out therein.

Now, it is obvious to all that the decision to dismiss is, in
and of itself, the correct one. What we have here is a case
of the right Judgement illegally submitted. Personally, had
I been the CotC, I probably would have rejected the Judgement
as illegal, listed Chuck as having defaulted, and re-assigned
the CFJ to a new Judge. But the CotC did accept the Judgement
as legally submitted, and I am not inclined to press the point.
Instead, I wish to consider what precedent to set for future
Justices faced with the Appeal of an illegally made Judgement.
It seems to me that the best course, as a matter of principle,
is re-assignment, and so I hereby order that the CFJ be re-assigned
to a new Judge.

I judge CFJ 1050 TRUE.
Blob is clearly not subscribed to agora-business.

======================================================================

Evidence:
1. Rule 478 (Excerpt)
2. Registrar's Report (Excerpt)
3. list of subscribers of agora-business@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au

R478 (in part)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

I judge that the Statement is TRUE.

Morendil has been Elde's Executor in Probate since being so designated
by Notary Murphy after Elde was deregistered the first time on July 25.
Morendil has neither resigned as Elde's EiP, nor has he announced that
Elde is no longer in Probate. Hence according to R1738, he remains
Elde's Executor in Probate.
