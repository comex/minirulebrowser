                               CFJ 942

Rule 789 should be interpreted such that a document purporting to be
a Call for Judgement alleging that a Rule should be interpreted in a
certain way, but which does not include a list of Relevant Rules
assembled by the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted, is
not in fact a CFJ, and that therefore neither the Clerk of the Courts
nor any other Player incur any obligations regarding it.

  Judged FALSe by ChrisM, 15 Sep 97 13:58:10 -0400

======================================================================

Relevant Rules: 789, 991

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:
I don't really have particularly strong feelings about this one way
or the other, but it seems we need a decision, and this will set a
precedent we can use in future cases, should any such arise. I have
a mild tendency to think that the Statement is TRUE, for reasons which
I outline below.

There are reasonable arguments on both sides, which the Judge must
choose between. These turn on how the word 'must' in R789 should be
interpreted:

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

On the one hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing an obligation
on a Caller to include a list of Relevant Rules, an obligation which, if
the Caller fails to meet it, results in the Caller having violated R789.
On this reading, there is no reason to think that the legality of the CFJ
is brought into question by the Caller's having violated R789, and so the
Statement would be FALSE.

On the other hand, we could interpret this 'must' as imposing a condition
on what it takes to be a CFJ. On this reading, it is partially definitive
of being a CFJ (of the relevant kind) that it be accompanied by a list
of Relevant Rules. This would bring R789 into conflict with R991, which
offers an incompatible definition:

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

Since R789 wins this conflict by virtue of its lower Number, we arrive
at the conclusion that the Statement is TRUE.

Two possible interpretations, both plausible. Is there any reason to
favour one over the other? I think there is such a reason: the
precise wording of R789, which states that "A CFJ...must...", and not
"The Caller of a CFJ...must...". I think this gives us a reason to
regard to R789 more plausibly as imposing a condition on what it
takes to be a CFJ than as imposing a requirement on the Caller. It
may not be a terribly powerful reason for preferring the second
interpretation to the first, but in the absence of other compelling
reasons to make one judgement rather than the other, it may prove
decisive. At any rate, I offer it to the Judge for eir consideration.

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R789 with the Statement, as e is permitted to do by R789.
[Maybe at last I'll get my self-referential annotation of R789!]

======================================================================

Decision and Reasoning Judge:

My judgement on CFJ 942:

FALSE.

But for a reason no one seems to have noticed. I was, at first, quite 
inclined to agree with the Caller. In fact, I felt less equivocal about 
it than he did. It seemed to me that, in the absence of clear wording 
specifying that, without a list of Relevant Rules, the *Caller* had made 
an error or committed a crime, the correct interpretation would be that 
the CFJ was simply invalid without said list. The minimum requirement for 
that list would simply be a notation that the rule in question was itself 
relevant to the CFJ; after all, "a list of relevant rules" does not imply 
a *complete* list. And as anyone with LISP or set theory experience 
knows, a list with only one item is still a list.

But then I came to the part in the Caller's argument related to Rule 991. 
He noted that, under my interpretation of Rule 789, the two rules were in 
conflict. He then stated that, because of rule 789's lower number, it 
takes precedence. And that would be well and true except that Rule 991 
has a Power of 2, while Rule 789 has a Power of 1. Under Rule 1482 
(Power=3), Rule 991 thus takes precedence, and we are in a situation where

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.
      (991/3)

Therefore the statement is FALSE.

                               CFJ 941

All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule were made impossible
by the Frankenstein Generator when the change to the Frankenstein
Monster assigned to "Week 1", reported by the Mad Scientist on Mon,
11 August 1997, took effect.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The Frankenstein Generator, 1672, requires among other things that 

      vii) All proposed Amendments to the Frankenstein Rule must
           consist of a single sentence of additional text specifying
           the properties and effects of a Frankenstein Monster, to be
           inserted between the first and last paragraphs.

However, the Frankenstein Monster, at the time specified in the
statement, contained the sentence

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Frankenstein Monster 
      is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing 
      the Frankenstein Monsters, which is permitted only when a 
      Frankenstein Monster or set of Frankenstein Monsters explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions
permitting such changes.

The introduction of additional text "specifying the properties and
effects of a Frankenstein Monster" is equivalent to "changing the
Frankenstein Monsters". So the FM prohibits the only proposed
amendments to the FR allowed by the FG.
(Note that amendments that change nothing are excluded by point

       vi) No Amendment can be applied to the Frankenstein Rule that
           is substantially the same as any prior successfully applied
           Amendment to the Frankenstein Rule.

of 1672)

Admittedly, this argument has two ossible weaknesses: The equivalence
stated in the preceding paragraph may be challenged. But I consider
this equivalence to hold - let the judge decide for emself.

And the FM also contains the sentence

      A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.

But I would say that, while the FM is permitted to define such
mechanisms, it doesn't actually do it, so this sentence establishes no
explicit or implicit permission to change the FM, after all.

======================================================================

Decision & Arguments Judge:

I find the Statement FALSE.

The Caller's arguments included the following:

It did not, however, contain any explicit or implicit permissions

------------------------

However, the Frankenstein Rule does contain the following clause:

A Frankenstein Monster is permitted to define its own mechanisms
      for changing its own content, and any change to a Frankenstein
      Monster adopted in accordance with its own mechanisms is legal.
---------------

"Any change to a Frankenstein Monster adopted in accordance with its
own mechanisms is legal." Now, in the absence of any clearly specified
mechanisms, is a given Amendment in accordance with them or not? Well,
your mileage may differ, but I consider this to be almost trivially true.
One cannot be in conflict with a non-existent law. Therefore, I declare
that (as of this time), the Frankenstein Monster gives implicit
permission to change itself.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction. 

should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

I reproduce as my argument the one I gave for the same conclusion
in my Judgement of CFJ 937:

"It's worth commenting at this point on an ambiguity in R1504: it's
not clear whether the report of the Infraction and the report of the
gain in Blots have to be made in the same message, or whether the
report of gain in Blots can follow the report of the Infraction by up
to seven days. The first sentence [sic] of R1504 states that
"Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their legal
report". But the legal report of what: the penalties or the
infractions? If infractions is meant, R1504 is somewhat in tension
with itself, since it immediately goes on to imply (along with other
Rules, eg R1599) that the application of the penalty can be later
than the report of the Infraction. So I read R1504 as saying that
penalties for Infractions are applied at the time the penalty is
reported, which can be later than the time the Infraction is reported."

Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge of the CFJ issue an Injunction requesting
the Rulekeepor to annotate R1504 with the statement and the list
of relevant Rules below, as e is permitted to do by R789.

Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

====================================================================

Judge's Reasoning:

The first clause of the provision in question says

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report

As a native English speaker, I have no hesitation in interpreting the
word "their" in this context to refer to "Penalties for Infractions".
The alternative interpretation, with the antecedent being "Infractions",

ambiguity, the more natural interpretation of the language must be used.
