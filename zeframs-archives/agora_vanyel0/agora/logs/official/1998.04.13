AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No Trustees on hold

Amend 1757 by replacing the string

"          or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee."

with 

"       d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee;
           or
        e) e goes on hold."

[Comment: The probate procedure is slow enough as it is; this will
make the effect of going on hold for trustees similar to that for
officers. If someone goes on hold just to get rid of eir trusteeship
(and, possibly, other offices) and to avoid the score penalty for
resigning in my Proposal "A Scoring nitpick", well, so be
it. Delegating offices and other cleanup before going on hold will
probably be more work than simply finishing the trustee's job.]

Proposal  (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Vacated blots and scores

Amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The Herald must order this Score change.

      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the Public

Proposal  (Murphy) AI = 1
Plots

[Part One:  Replace Locations with Plots]

Rename Rule 1706 ("Locations") to "Plots" and amend it to read:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially owned
      by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name Without
      Objection.

      Plots are not Locations; no Location shall become a Plot due to the
      adoption of the Proposal which enacted this Rule.  One second after this
      Rule is created, it shall amend itself by removing this paragraph.

Create a new Rule entitled "Buying and Selling Plots" with this text:

      The Market Value of a Plot is 5 VTs, unless the Rules state
      otherwise.  In particular, the Market Value of the first three
      Bank-owned Plots purchased by a given Player is 0 VTs.

      A Player may become the owner of a Bank-owned Plot by transferring the
      Market Value of that Plot to the Bank for the sole purpose of buying
      that Plot.

      A Plot's owner may transfer ownership of it to any other consenting
      entity, by informing the Cartographor that e wishes to do so.  For the
      purposes of this Rule, the Bank is always deemed to consent to such
      wishes.  Furthermore, as soon as possible after a Plot is transferred to
      the Bank in this way, the Cartographor shall pay out half the Plot's
      Market Value to the transferring entity.

Repeal Rule 1707 ("Movement").

Amend Rule 1708 ("Adjacency") to read:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.  Two
      Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

Repeal Rule 1709 ("Distance").

[Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") will be amended later.]


For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y) from 0 to 9,
a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the Longitude for
"Y") is created.


Create a Rule entitled "Winning by Ownership" with this text:

      If at least one-third of all Plots are not owned by the Bank, and all
      Plots not owned by the Bank are owned by a single entity, then that
      entity's Executor satisfies a Win Condition known as a Win by Monopoly.

      Upon the correct report of such a Win, all Plots become Owned by the
      Bank.


[Part Two:  Define Structures and Ergs]

Create a Rule entitled "Structures" with this text:

      There exists a class of entities known as Structures.  Each Structure is
      assigned to a Plot and owned by that Plot's owner.  No entity may
      own more than five Structures, unless another Rule specifies otherwise.

Create a Rule entitled "Ergs" with this text:

      Ergs are a Currency.  Their MUQ is 1.  Their Recordkeepor is the
      Cartographor.  Their Mintor is the Bank.

Amend Rule 1677 ("Currency Awards for New Players") to read:

      As soon as possible after the start of a Player's Grace Period, the
      Registrar shall pay out 5 Voting Tokens, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs to that
      Player.

Amend Rule 1701 ("Proposal Notes") by removing this paragraph:

      Whenever there exists a Player who has never before possessed
      any P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player.

Create a Rule with this text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule:
        * All Voting Tokens and P-Notes are destroyed.
        * All obligations to transfer Currency due to Rule 1754
            ("Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank") are cancelled.
        * For each Player, 5 VTs, 1 P-Note, and 30 Ergs are created in
            that Player's possession.

      One second after this Rule is created, it repeals itself.


[Part Three:  Make Structures useful]

Create a Rule entitled "Types of Structures" with this text:

      All Structures have a Type.  Only Types of Structure defined by
      the Rules exist.

      A Player may create a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify the Structure's Type, and to which Plot the Structure
      is assigned.  As soon as possible after this happens, the Cartographor
      shall bill that Player the price of that Type of Structure.

      A Player may destroy a Structure by informing the Cartographor.  E
      must specify to which Plot the Structure is assigned.  As soon as
      possible after this happens, the Cartographor shall pay out to that
      Player half the price of that Type of Structure.

Create a rule titled "Maintenance of Structures" with this text:

      A Player's Maintenance Fee equals the total of the Maintenance Fees of
      all the Structures e owns, plus 1 Erg per Type of Structure e owns, at
      the end of the Nomic Week.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall bill each Player's Maintenance Fee to that Player.

Create a rule titled "Production of Structures" reading:

      As soon as possible after the end of the Nomic Week, the Cartographor
      shall pay out each Structure's Production to its owner, excluding
      Structures whose Type changed during that Week, and excluding Players
      with a Maintenance Fee that is neither satisfied, disputed, nor vacated.

Create a Rule entitled "Standard Types of Structures" with this text:

      The following Types of Structure exist, with the specified prices,
      Productions, and Maintenance Fees, unless otherwise specified:

        Type       Price      Production     Maintenance Fee
        ----------------------------------------------------
        Farm       4 Ergs     1 VT           1 Erg
        House      4 Ergs     1 P-Note       1 Erg
        Mine       4 Ergs     3 Ergs         1 Erg
        Church     4 Ergs     special        1 Erg

      Churches have no Production.  However, when an Indulgence is to be
      given to a random Player, each Church is deemed to be two Players,
      and any Indulgence that would otherwise be given to a Church is
      instead given to its owner.  This Rule takes precedence over any
      Rule attempting to prevent Churches from having this effect.


[Part Four:  Amend the Rule defining the Cartographor and eir duties]

Amend Rule 1710 ("The Cartographor") to read:

      There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures since
            the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the last
            Report


[Part Five:  Clean up other references to Locations]

Amend Rule 869 ("Registered Players") by removing the following paragraph:

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

Amend Rule 1016 ("Putting Oneself On Hold") by replacing "Moves to the Stasis
Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum", and by replacing "Moves from the
Stasis Chamber" with "says so in the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by removing the text "whose Location is the Beer
Hall".

Amend Rule 1367 ("Degrees") by adding this paragraph:

      "Granting a Degree" and "awarding a Degree" are synonymous.  A Player who
      has been awarded a Degree possesses that Degree.

Repeal Rule 1711 ("Accepting Degrees").

Repeal Rule 1788 ("VT unemployment benefits").

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Harlequin) AI = 1
Electees

Rename Rule 1555 ("Retirement and Removal From Offices") to "Electees and
Removal From Offices," and amend it to read:

      Any Player who holds an Office by virtue of having won an
      Election for that Office is called the Electee to that
      Office.

      When an Electee to an Office is retired from that Office,
      e ceases to be the Electee for that Office. When an Electee 
      to an Office is removed from that Office, e ceases to be
      Electee to that Office, and if e currently holds the Office,
      the Speaker shall become the holder of that Office, unless 
      another Rule specifies a different Player who is to become 
      the temporary of that Office. 

{Comment:

Changed this paragraph to deal with situations where an Electee is removed
or retired from an Office which e does not currently hold.
}

      When a non-Electee Player is removed from an Office, that
      Office shall become held normally by the Electee of that
      Office, if there is an Electee. Otherwise, the Office shall
      be held temporarily by the Speaker.

      If a Player goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, 
      e shall be removed from all Offices e holds.

Amend Rule 790 ("Filling Vacant Offices") to read:

      Whenever there is an Office with no current Electee, for
      which an Election is not currently being conducted, the
      Registrar shall initiate an Election for that Office,
      as described elsewhere, unless the Office is that of
      Registrar; in that case, the Speaker shall conduct the
      Election. 

Amend Rule 1486 ("Procedure to Impeach an Officer") to read:

      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to  
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by requesting such in 
      the Public Forum. The Officer is Impeached when such a
      Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must
      be greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

Amend Rule 1644 ("Dereliction of Duty") by replacing the text:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and

with the text:

      (i)   is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds, and 
            whose duties include the weekly production of an Official 
            Report, and

Amend Rule 1664 ("Rebellion") by replacing the text:

      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.

with the text:

      - All Players who are currently Electees to one or more Offices
        cease to be Electees to those Offices.
        
Amend Rule 1645 ("Temporary Delegation of Offices") to read:

      An Electee to an Office who currently holds that Office is 
      permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that 
      Office, for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called 
      Delegation; the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to 
      as the Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein 
      referred to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player is still the Electee to the
            Office, and still holds the office at the commencement
            of the Period of Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules. At the end of the Period of 
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office,
      if e is permitted to do so. If not, the Speaker holds the
      Office.

Amend Rule 880 ("Resignation of Offices") to read:

      A Player may, at any time, resign from any Office which e
      currently holds. 

      An Electee to an Office who resigns from that Office may
      appoint a successor at the time e resigns. In this case,
      the resigning Player is retired from that Office; if the 
      named successor agrees in the Public Forum to be successor 
      to the Office, the named successor becomes holder of the 
      Office.

      A non-Electee who resigns an Office, or an Electee who
      does not name a successor, is immediately removed from
      Office.

{Comment:

Changed this Rule to fix mistake with 'retire'/'resign' terminology.
}

Amend Rule 1758 ("Holding an Office In Perpetuity") by replacing the text:

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,

with the text:

      If a Player is the Electee to an Office which e currently holds,

Amend Rule 1659 ("The Right to Call Elections") by replacing the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

with the text:

                 This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held by their Electees, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  

and the text:

      all such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

to the text:

      the Electees of these Offices shall cease to be the Electees to 
      those Offices.

Amend Rule 1450 ("Speaker Cannot Stay CotC or Justiciar") to read:

      If at any time the Speaker shall be the Electee to either
      the Office of CotC or the Office of Justiciar, e shall be
      retired from whichever of those Offices e is Electee to.

Amend Rule 910 ("The Justiciar") by replacing the text:

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either
      Speaker or Clerk of the Courts, e is immediately retired from
      the Office of Justiciar.

with the text:

      from the Office of Justiciar.

Amend Rule 1652 ("When the Speaker is Tainted") by replacing the text:

      and the Office of
      Speaker-Elect is held in normal fashion.

with the text:

      and the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by its Electee.

and the text:

      only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion

with the text:

      only until the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by an
      Electee who is not the Speaker.

Variable Batch Sizes

[Comment: fixed the bug spotted by Murphy (I think?), and decided
after all to force the Promotor to give a bit of warning -4 days,
in fact. Note that "midnight GMT Thursday" is assumed to mean
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, in line with the customary 
interpretation of R459.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Murphy) AI = 1
Recognize Canada

Create a new rule entitled "Recognize Canada" with this text:

     Agora Nomic recognizes the nation of Canada as a peer Nomic.  The
     Ambassador of Agora shall present official Greetings from the Players
     of Agora to the Citizens of Canada, along with a copy of the text of
     this Rule.

Proposal 3730 (Swann) AI = 1
The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1766 be amended to read:

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'A Win for Threat',
be created with the following text:

      The members of The Threat win the game upon creation of this
      Rule. This takes precedence over Rules that would prevent any
      of them from winning the game at that time.

      All members of The Threat are granted the Patent Title "Threat
      to the Game".

      Player Swann shall also win the game, and be granted the Patent
      Title, "Loose Cannon."

      At 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998, this Rule and the Rule "Officer's
      Veto Scam" are repealed.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'Officer's Veto Scam',
be created with the following text:

      When a Win occurs under authority of the Rule "A Win For Threat"
      then the Assessor, Speaker-Elect, Commander-in-Chief, and Clerk
      of the Courts are all required, in addition to any other duties
      they may have, to detect and report that win in the Public Forum,
      within one week.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "Threat Trombones" be created
with the following text:

      This Rule can empower the Threat Vizier to create an instrument
      of Power 4.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
      prevent it from so doing.

      The Threat Vizier shall have the power to create an instrument
      of Power 4 called a Threat Trombone, whose content shall be to
      change the Power of any Rule or Rules created by the Proposal
      which created this Rule, E creates and executes such an instrument
      by posting it in the Public Forum, and the provisions contained
      in the text of that Instrument are implemented, any Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      This rule repeals itself at 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule be created with the following text:

      No instrument can create, or empower another entity to
      create, another instrument with a Power greater than its own
      Power.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that specifies
      the Power of the created instrument.  Proposals are explicitly
      exempt from this provision.

      Instruments created by the Rule "Threat Trombones" are also
      explicitly exempt from the preceding provisions. This paragraph
      deletes itself at 12:00 GMT on 31 March 1998.

      In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
      a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
      Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
      Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
      Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
      effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
      Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

      If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
      specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the
      Power of the new instrument is 1.

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled 'A Monument to the Threat',
be created with the following text:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal number> at time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a loophole
      in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

      This Rule also commemerates the Unexpected and Surprising Win
      achieved by Swann, who, working independently, achieved and nearly
      implemented eir own scam to close the loophole in the Instrument Rules,
      which would have screwed this all up if he hadn't agreed to join this
      scam in exchange for this paragraph.

Be it further resolved that the Rule 'A Monument to the Threat' be
amended by replacing in it the text '<proposal number>' with the number
of the Proposal containing this provision, and the text '<time>' with
the time at which that Proposal took effect.

======================================================================
Proposal 3731 (Steve) AI = 1
Variable Batch Sizes

[Comment: fixed the bug spotted by Murphy (I think?), and decided
after all to force the Promotor to give a bit of warning -4 days,
in fact. Note that "midnight GMT Thursday" is assumed to mean
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, in line with the customary 
interpretation of R459.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule entitled "The Promotor can change
the Batch Size" be created with the following text:

      The Batch Size is an integer with a value between two and six
      inclusive, indicating the number of Proposals which will be
      distributed by the Promotor in the following Nomic Week,
      provided that there are that many Proposals in the Queue.
      Unless the Rules give it another value, the Batch Size is five.

      The Promotor may change the value of the Batch Size by
      announcing the new value in the Public Forum, provided that
      e announces a value between two and six inclusive, that e makes
      the announcement prior to midnight GMT Thursday, and that e has
      not already made such an announcement earlier in the Week. As
      indicated above, this change in the Batch Size has the effect
      of changing the number of Proposals which will be distributed
      by the Promotor in the Nomic Week *following* that in which the
      change is made; once the Week has begun, the Promotor cannot
      change the number of Proposals which will be distributed in
      that Week by changing the Batch Size.
      
Be it further resolved that R1770 (Distributing Proposals) be amended
by replacing the text in which currently reads:

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

with text which reads:

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue with a
      Priority greater than zero is less than or equal to the Batch
      Size, then the batch shall consist of all such Proposals.

      If the number of Proposals in the Proposal Queue is greater
      than the Batch Size, then the batch shall consist of those
      Proposals in the Queue with the highest Priority such that the
      number of Proposals distributed is equal to the Batch Size.

======================================================================
Proposal 3732 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No Trustees on hold

Amend 1757 by replacing the string

"          or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee."

with 

"       d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee;
           or
        e) e goes on hold."

[Comment: The probate procedure is slow enough as it is; this will
make the effect of going on hold for trustees similar to that for
officers. If someone goes on hold just to get rid of eir trusteeship
(and, possibly, other offices) and to avoid the score penalty for
resigning in my Proposal "A Scoring nitpick", well, so be
it. Delegating offices and other cleanup before going on hold will
probably be more work than simply finishing the trustee's job.]

======================================================================
Proposal 3733 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
Vacated blots and scores

Amend 1784 by replacing the paragraph reading

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

with       

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.
      Whenever a Payment order for a certain number of indulgences 
      naming a player as payor is vacated, this player shall gain a 
      number of Points equal to twice the number of indulgences in 
      the PO. The Herald must order this Score change.

======================================================================
Proposal 3734 (Kolja A.) AI = 1
No PI for players on hold

Amend 1713 by replacing the second sentence with the following text:

      If the Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a 
      given Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order 
      naming it as Payor is not on hold, e commits the Infraction of 
      Persistent Indebtedness at the beginning of that Week. If the
      Executor of such an entity comes off hold, e commits the 
      Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness.
