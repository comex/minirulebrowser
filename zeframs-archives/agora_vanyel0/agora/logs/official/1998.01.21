                               CFJ 1080

  "If the rules require that a player has to perform an action at a
   particular time, or during a particular time period, and e fails to
   do so, then e is not required to perform the action at a later time."


======================================================================

Judge:       Morendil
Judgement:

Eligible:    Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve,
             Swann, Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Blob

======================================================================
History:

  Called by Blob, 20 Jan 1998 14:01:45 +1100
  Assigned to Morendil, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

The rules are unclear on this. Some Officers have taken it upon
themselves to play catch-up when they missed a report, but the rules
do not necessarily require this. (In some cases they might not even
permit it, especially if it involves making Payment Orders and the like.)
