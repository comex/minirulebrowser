The following proposal has been submitted to Internomic by Ackanomic:

----
Ammend R215 by replacing the string "Rishonomic" with the string "New
Rishonnomic"
----

It has been published on the IN mailing list with a Date: Sat, 25 Oct
1997 10:26:50 -0400 header. On the conservative assumption that this
early date will be used to determine the end of the voting period on
this proposal in IN, the Agora referendum about this proposal will
last until Sat, 1 Nov 1997 10:26:50 -0400. 

I'm sorry this is such a short period, but zefram obviously had other
things on eir mind and published the result of the ambassador election
very late. And I didn't want to wait for my fix of 1632 to be adopted,
because that wouldn't have led to a much longer voting period, either.

BTW, 215 is the rule that lists the member nomics (players) of IN. Let
me also note that the two typos in the Proposal ("aMMend" and "New
RishoNNomic") have already been noticed on the IN mailing list. As IN
does not have rules about typos, it is not clear what (if anything)
the adoption of this proposal will do, and what Nomic (if any) an
amended rule would refer to. If anyone wants to join this discussion
or make an IN CFJ, go ahead.

 All member nomics must always abide by all Internomic rules then
      in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect.  At the
      start of the first game, rules 101-114 are immutable, and rules
      201-216 are mutable.  Subsequently, the number of a rule does not
      indicate that rule's mutability.

 A nomic is a game in which the rules are changeable by those who
      play it.  The entities which play this nomic, aka "Internomic",
      are themselves nomics, aka "member nomics".  Every member nomic
      shall be either a voting member or a nonvoting member.  References
      in this ruleset to "nomics" or "members" shall mean member nomics,
      and shall include both voting and nonvoting members, unless
      otherwise noted.  References in the ruleset to "rules" shall mean
      Internomic rules, unless otherwise noted.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A rule change takes effect at the moment the proposal containing it is
adopted. If the rule change is a rule creation, the rule created gets a
rulenumber equal to the lowest integer equal to or higher than the number
of the proposal that is not the number of an existing rule. For the
purpose of this rule, different rule changes in one proposal are regarded
to take place subsequently in the order in which they are given in the
proposal.

It is forbidden to alter the essentials of the game state except as is
explicitly or implicitly permitted by a rule or a set of rules. The
essentials of the game state consist of the rules themselves, the scores of
the member nomics, the proposals, the votes cast on proposals, the
statements for judgement and verdicts returned upon them, and anything else
so designated by some rule. No other things are included in the essentials
of the game state.

InterNomic will try to vote on every proposal 96 hours before the
end of the voting period of the proposal. <P>

InterNomic's vote will be determined at the time InterNomic tries to
vote, according to the following rules:<P>

i) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted for the proposal than against it, InterNomic
will vote for the proposal.<P>

ii) If at the time InterNomic tries to vote more voting members of
Internomic have voted against the proposal than for it, InterNomic
will vote against the proposal.<P>

iii) If neither i) nor ii) applies, InterNomic will not vote on the
proposal.<P>

This vote from InterNomic is automatic. Its outcome shall be
determined by the moderator. This vote is a valid vote.<P>

The last two paragraphs of this rule take precedence over any other
rule concerning the validity of a vote.<P>
