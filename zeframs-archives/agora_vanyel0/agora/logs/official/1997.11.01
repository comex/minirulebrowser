Results of the referendum on Internomic Proposal 349


Eligible voters at beginning of voting period: 17 active, 0 on hold.

Seven votes/declarations of presence were received, so quorum is met.
The veotes were as follows:

Crito         AGAINST

Kolja A.      FOR

Michael       FOR

Oerjan        FOR

Scott         AGAINST

Steve         AGAINST

Swann         PRESENT


The adoption ratio is 1, so Agora will ABSTAIN in the IN vote on this
referendum. According to IN rule 207,

>>
Voting members may vote either for or against any proposal by sending
their vote to the moderator by the end of the voting period on that
proposal. The moderator may not reveal any votes until the end of the
voting period. Any voting member who does not vote has abstained.
<<

This means that I will not submit a vote to IN. I will, however, post
a statement that we are abstaining deliberately, because I think it is
fair (and good foor our reputation...) to let people know this is
intentional and not a sign of lazyness on our part.
