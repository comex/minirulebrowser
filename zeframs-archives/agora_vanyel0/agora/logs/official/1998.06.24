I hereby order the Bank to pay Oerjan a judicial salary of 1 VT.  I
also order the Scorekeepor to note that Oerjan's score has increased
by three points. 

======================================================================
                               CFJ 1098

  Kolja A. has bought plot "Area 44".

======================================================================

Judge:        Oerjan

Judgement:    FALSE

Eligible:     Antimatter, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos,
              Harlequin, Macross, Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan,
              Steve, Swann

Not eligible:
Caller:       Kolja A.
Barred:       -
Disqualified: -
On hold:      -

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Kolja A., Mon, 15 Jun 1998 18:15:19 +0200
  Assigned to Oerjan, Thu, 18 Jun 1998 09:37:49 +0100
  Judged FALSE, Thu, 18 Jun 1998 20:04:58 +0200
  Published, as of this message

======================================================================

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

Rule 1577 says:

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Minimum Unit
      Quantity (MUQ).  This quantity is the smallest amount of that
      Currency which is permitted to be transferred.  All transfers
      and holdings of a Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest
      multiple of its MUQ.

      The MUQ of a given Currency is 1 if no other specification
      exists.


Clearly, then, zero Transfers are prohibited.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

In a mail to the PF I included the following:

>>
I transfer 0 VTs
from myself to the bank for the sole purpose of buying plots Area 44
<<

While this is not a valid TO under the definition of 1598, I have
nevertheless transferred 0 VTs to the bank for the sole purpose etc as
required in 1843, which only requires the _transfer_, not the
existence or satisfaction of a valid _TO_. The transfer of 0 VTs is a
null action and doesn't require any interference from any officers to
take place. It only needs to be mentioned because the plot I want to
buy has to be identified.

By the terms of the recently adopted "Secret Voting" rule, votes in
the Cartographor election which are sent to the PF will make the
Player casting the vote subject to the Infraction of Public Voting,
for which the penalty is 1 VT and 1 Blot.

The Proposal Queue as of 24 June, 1998

Using the Promotor's Privilege, I increase the priority of "Leftover Loophole
Cleaning" by one.

Acting as Executor and on behalf of the Repeal-O-Matic, I transfer one P-Note
from the R-O-M to the Bank to increase the priority of "Repeal Rule 1766 (The
Officer's Vote) by one.

This gives you a choice (if you care to vote at all), either amend the
Officer's Vote to be only a veto vote, or get rid of it altogether.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Leftover Loophole Cleaning

Rule 1766 is amended to read as follows;

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by a Voting Entity.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ombudsman Mk II

Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman)

     There is a Patent Title of Ombudsman.  This title shall be awarded 
     in the following ways;

       i) If the prior Ombudsman designates an eligible successor, then 
          the Player designated by the Ombudsman is awarded the title.

      ii) If a referendum is called to award the title to an eligible 
          Player, then upon the passage of that referendum the title is 
          awarded to that Player.

     iii) If no Ombudsman exists, then the Speaker shall, in the Public 
          Forum, call for volunteers from amongst all eligible Players.  
          One week from this call, the speaker shall select one of the
          elgible voulenteers at random to become the new Ombudsman.

     Whenever a player is awarded the title of Ombudsman, that title is 
     removed from all prior holders.

     The player holding the title of Ombudsman shall be known as the 
     Ombudsman.

     If an Ombudsman ceases to be a Player, then eir title is removed.

{Comment: The Ombudsman isn't an Office, and it's only an elected
          position in certian rare curcumstances.  The idea is to create
          an advocate for the less powerful Players.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Elgibility to be Ombudsman)

     In order to be eligible to be the Ombudsman, the following must be 
     true of a Player;

       i) The Player must hold no Office nor be the Speaker.
      ii) The Player must not be On Hold.
     iii) The Player must not be Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group.
      iv) The Player has no Blots.

     If any of these conditions become false of any Ombudsman, that 
     Player has a period of 14 days to either correct the situation or 
     designate a willing successor in the Public Forum. If the Ombudsman
     fails to do either within the 14 day period, then the Title of 
     Ombudsman is immediately removed from that Player.

{Comment: The prerequisites of the Ombudsman exist to prevent eim from
          becoming part of a coalition.  E is intended to be 
          independent.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Designating a Successor Ombudsman)

     At any time, an Ombudsman is permitted to designate an eligible 
     player to succeed him as Ombudsman.  E must do this in the Public 
     Forum.  To be successful, this designation must be of a willing 
     player.

     If a successor is designated, and that Player is eligible to be the 
     Ombudsman, and that Player consents to be the Ombudsman in the 
     Public Forum within three days of the designation, then that Player 
     is awarded the title of Ombudsman either upon the designation, or 
     upon eir consent, whichever is later.

{Comment: This is intended to be the basic mechanisim for changing 
          Ombudsmen.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Referendum to replace the Ombudsman)

     Any Player can call for a referendum to replace the Ombudsman.  The 
     Player must make this call in the Public Forum, and the Referendum 
     must name an eligible Player to replace the current Ombudsman.  For 
     the referendum to begin, the named Player must consent in the 
     Public Forum within the two days immediately after the call.  If 
     the named Player consents, then the voting period begins as of the 
     consent.

     The default procedure for referenda changes as follows;  Vote 
     collector is the Player who called for the referendum.  Voting 
     entities only include players who hold no Office and are not the 
     Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group, and who are not the
     Speaker.

     If the referendum passes, the named player becomes Ombudsman, if it 
     fails, the referendum has no effect.

{Comment: This is the recourse to deal with an Ombudsman who doesn't 
          perform to the ideals of the position.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Duties and Responsibilities of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman is responsible for being the voice of the people of 
     Agora.  His duties, broadly defined, are as follows;

       i) To help new Players acclimate to Agora by providing mentoring
          and guidance.
      ii) To hear grievances by the Players and bring them to the 
          attention of Officers and the Speaker.
     iii) To fight injustice insofar as the powers of the Ombudsman 
          allow.
      iv) To be an impartial and independent representative for all the
          Players of Agora.

     Other Rules shall define the specifics of these duties and 
     responsibilities.

{Comment: The broad outlines of what the Ombudsman is for. }


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Grievance Report)

     The Ombudsman has the responsibility to hear confidential 
     grievances from any Player about the game of Agora. The Ombudsman 
     shall regularly poll the people of Agora, with special attention to 
     those Players who hold no Office, and solicit their grievances.  In 
     addition, any Player with a grievance can submit their grievances 
     to the Ombudsman without being polled.  These grievances need not 
     be matters of law (which are subjects of the courts) but can be 
     manners of style, culture, fairness, and anything else that affects 
     a Player's ability to participate in Agora and enjoy doing so.

     Every week, the Ombudsman shall publish an Official Grievance 
     Report listing grievances e has received since the last such 
     report.  This report shall not give out the names of the Players 
     with these grievances unless the Player with the grievance 
     explicitly states that eir name is to be attached to the report, 
     otherwise all grievances given to the Ombudsman shall be 
     confidential and shall never be revealed.  This rule takes 
     precedence over any rule that would require or permit the Ombudsman 
     to violate this confidentiality.

{Comment: I think this would be useful, especially in times of crisis.
          Having an anonymous forum to vent might help with a historical 
          problem where Players have felt that their complaints about 
          the game resulted in personal attacks upon them.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Duty to New and Inexperienced Players)

     Upon the registration of any new Player the Ombudsman shall 
     communicate to that Player, as soon as possible, the fact that the 
     Ombudsman exists to be a mentor to that Player.  The Ombudsman 
     shall also provide the following services to any Player.

       i) To the best of eir ability answer any question about Agora. 
      ii) To assist any player in understanding the mechanics of a given 
          action (submitting/judging a CFJ, submitting a Proposal, 
          manipulating currency, and so on.)
     iii) To direct a player's query to the appropriate Officer. (Such 
          as FOIA requests and so on.)
      iv) Provide advice to any player who needs it.

{Comment: This is meant to be a replacement for the late Welcome Wagon,
          which never got rolling.  I think it would be nice for newbies 
          (and others) can have a centralized authority to consult 
          with in trying to play this increasingly complex game.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Special Privileges of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman shall have the following rights and privileges, to be 
     exercised only in the spirit of advocacy for *all* Agorans;

       i) Once every month, the Ombudsman is permitted and empowered to 
          vacate up to five Blots belonging a single individual Player.
          This must only be done to correct what the Ombudsman believes 
          to be an injustice to an otherwise Rule-abiding Player.

      ii) The Ombudsman is permitted to cast an additional two votes 
          AGAINST any proposal e believes disenfranchises a large number 
          of Players,  distributes power unfairly, or adversely affects 
          a large class of Players who do not themselves have the 
          resources to oppose.

     iii) The Ombudsman has the power to, once a week, pay out one of 
          any currency, other than an Indulgence, minted by the Bank to
          any single Player who has none of that currency.

      iv) If the Ombudsman Rebels, e counts as three players toward a
          Revolt.

     In addition, the Ombudsman shall receive a weekly stipend equal to 
     1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary, to be paid out by the 
     Registrar.

{Comment: These powers are designed to help the Ombudsman in eir
          duties.  I tweaked them a little so there's less a chance of
          unbalancing Blots.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Revamp New Player Incentives.

Rule 1677 is amended to read as follows;

     Upon commencement of a new Player's Grace period, the Registrar 
     shall pay out to that Player 3 VTs and 1 P-Note.

{Comment: Followed Oerjan's suggestion, giving newbies a Blot amnesty
          rather than an Indulgence.  Note, I lowered the award.}
          

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Blot Amnesty During the Grace Period)

     If a Player is subject to an Infraction during eir Grace period, e 
     shall not be billed any Indulgences due to that Infraction.  This 
     Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require or permit 
     that Player to be billed for those Indulgences.

     If the Rules specify a Player receive a specific number of Blots* 
     and those Blots are not the result of a Crime* and those Blots are 
     to be applied during that Player's Grace period, then those Blots 
     shall not be applied. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that 
     would require or permit that Player to receive those Blots.

{Comment: Instead of giving the new Player an Indulgence, this makes 
          them partially immune to Blots* with the exception of Crimes, 
          which are a rare and grave matter.}


Rule 1701 is amended by deleting the following phrase;

     "Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player."

{Comment: Moved it to 1677.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Grace Period Proposals)

     If a Proposal has been submitted by a Player during eir Grace 
     Period then that Proposal shall have an initial Priority of one.  
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify a different 
     initial Priority.

Rule 1442 is amended to read as follows;

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

      However, If the votes were cast by a Player during eir Grace 
      period, then the Assessor shall instead bill that Player a number 
      of Voting Tokens equal to half the votes cast by that Player.

{Comment: These are both intended to serve the same purpose as giving a
          newbie some starting currency, without flooding the market 
          with VTs and P-Notes.  Also, a shrewd newbie has the 
          opportunity to raise capital by selling eir cheaper actions at 
          a profit.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Repeal a Pointless Rule

Rule 1692 is hereby Repealed.

{Comment: Does anyone believe that a Power one rule can effectively
restrict the Power of any Rule with Higher Precedence?}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title:Minimum Power of Rules}

     All Rules shall have a Power of one or greater.  No Rule shall have 
     a Power less than one.  This Rule takes precedence over all other 
     Rules.

{Comment: This should be (more) effective.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the 
past couple of years, some ambiguity and a few outright contradictions 
crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's 
Report/Official Document confusion.  There are now Officer's Reports, 
which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an
      Officer's Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Officer's Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Officer's Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.


Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the appropriate Officer posts the intent to Ratify 
     in the Public Forum, and the Ratification is Executed when the 
     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post 
     that the Ratification has been made.

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional-- ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule."

{Comment: The ROM Rule has been amended to have the Promotor explicitly
          submit the ROM's Proposals to the PF, a much more natural time 
          of submission.}
