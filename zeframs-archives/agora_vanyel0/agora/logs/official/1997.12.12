The Nominating Period for the position of Cartographor has finished
with only one Nomination being made.  Therefore, I duly announce that
Michael is now filling the Office in the normal manner. 

The Nominating Period for the position of Archivist has also finished,
but there were no nominations received. 

This requires the process of Election to begin again.  Therefore I
announce that an Election is being held to fill the position of
Archivist.  Nominations are asked for. 

Michael.

======================================================================

                               CFJ 1075

     "Rule 1023 should be interpreted such that no Rule with lower
      precedence than it can succeed in prohibiting activity of a
      purely discussionary nature."

Relevant Rules: 1023, 1729

======================================================================
Judge:       Oerjan
Judgement:

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos,
             Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy, Oerjan, Swann,

Ineligible:
Caller:      Steve
Barred:      Harlequin
On request:
On hold:     Vir

======================================================================
Requested Injunction:

I request that the Judge issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor
to annotate R1023 with a copy of the Statement and the list of Relevant
Rules.


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Steve, 12 Dec 1997 14:42:31 +1100
  Assigned to Oerjan, as of this message


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R1023 contains the following provision:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

The 'ordering requirement' referred to is, of course, that of the
ASAP Rule. But this is irrelevant to the Statement. The provision,
I claim, has two distinct effects: it excludes discussionary activity
from the ASAP ordering requirement (a curious provision, since no-one
has ever been required to discuss anything), and it enforces the
permissibility of discussion at any time. These two effects are quite
independent of each other. So, for the purposes of judging the CFJ,
I would say that the relevant part of R1023 reads:

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature...may be conducted at
      any time.

As far as I know, this provision has never had any effect before. On
the other hand, no Rule has ever sought to prohibit discussion before.
Before, that is, R1729, which states, concerning Insane Proposals, that:

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been bended.

Leaving aside the question of whether there is an important distinction
between breaking the Rules and bending them, this Rule clearly seeks to
make some kinds of discussion illegal. This brings it into conflict with
R1023, a conflict which it loses, illustrating in a particular case,
the general truth of the Statement.
