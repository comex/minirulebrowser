======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments of Judge:

All rise for the right honorable Judge Crito, court is in session.  Be seated.

First, neither the original Transfer Order nor this CFJ make a clear
specification as to which "Plato" they are referring.  The CFJ does not even
make it explicitly clear that the "Plato" of the CFJ is the same as the "Plato"
of the Transfer Order.  However, the timing of the messages, the amount of VTs
specified in both messages, and common sense make an implicit link between the
two "Plato"s and the court finds this to be sufficient evidence that the two
messages refer to the same entity.  Furthermore, previous references to "Plato"
within Agora communications, the notoriety of one particular Plato, and the
lack of indications in these messages to the contrary, lead this court to
conclude that it is reasonable to assume the entity referred to as Plato in
these messages is the long since deceased, Greek philosopher.  It is the
opinion of this court, then, that these two messages unambiguously refer to the
Greek philosopher, Plato.

Next, the court must decide what it means to "possess" VTs.  Plato, being
deceased, is incapable of possessing anything in the physical sense.  It is
tempting to return a judgement of FALSE simply on these grounds.
Unfortunately, since VTs are an abstract entity, no one, living or dead, is
capable of physically possessing any VTs.  The Ruleset is replete with
references to Players and entities "possessing" such abstract entities -
Currencies, Kudos, Blots, etc.  It is clear then that the condition of an
entity "possessing VTs" is the condition that the Recordkeepor for VTs is
required by the Rules to record the fact that VTs are owned by that particular
entity.  No physical possession or capacity for physical possession is
required.

How can such a condition be met?  In the current context of this CFJ, the
existence of a valid, successfully executed Transfer Order establishes the
requirement for recording VT ownership per Rule 1598.  So now this court must
decide whether Zefram's message of Oct 29, 1997 which purported to transfer .9
VTs from emself to Plato was a valid, successfully executed Transfer Order.

There is no dispute that Zefram possessed at least .9 VTs at the time e sent
this message and that the format of the message was valid according to the
specifications laid out in R1598.  The validity of the Transfer Order then
depends on the validity of the deceased philosopher Plato as a destination
entity.  This becomes the crux of the CFJ.

The court notes that there is no definition of "entity" within the Rules.
However, whatever definition is used, it is clear that a person falls within
this definition.  Does death deprive a person of personhood?  No.  Death is a
property of a person, therefore any person, living or dead, must be considered
an entity for the purposes of R1598.  Does the property of being dead deprive a
person of the capacity of possessing VTs?

First, there is no statutory prohibition that prevents a person from possessing
VTs based on any of that person's properties.  Secondly, the death of a person,
absent explicit legal prohibitions, cannot prevent the VT Recordkeepor from
physically recording the possession of VTs by that person, nor can it prevent
the Rules from logically requiring the VT Recordkeepor to make such a record.

It is the opinion of this court that the Transfer Order issued by Zefram,
asking that .9 VTs be transferred from emself to Plato, was valid and legally
executed on October 29, 1997.  This stems from the fact that there is no
requirement for Plato to physically possess .9 VTs and there is no legal or
physical impediment preventing the Assessor from recording the effects of this
Transfer Order.  Therefore, the statement of CFJ 1062 must be considered true.
A judgement of TRUE is hereby entered.

All rise.  Court is adjourned.

-- Crito

Caller's Arguments:

Though the rules pertaining to the Rulekeepor require them to post a
copy of the ruleset every week, thy do not identify this as that
Office's Report.

======================================================================
Reasons and Arguments of the Judge:

I Judge this to be TRUE.

R&A:
Rule 1686 is clear on what constitutes an Official Report--it must
include information designated by the Rules to be part of that
Officer's Report.  As Caller correctly notes, the Rules do not designate
any information as a Rulekeepor's Report.  Thus, the Rulekeepor has
no Official Report.

Evidence: Rule 1686 (All other Rules constitute negative evidence,
but are not listed here in the interest of space.)

Rule 1686/0 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Reports.  The only information that is part of an
      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.
