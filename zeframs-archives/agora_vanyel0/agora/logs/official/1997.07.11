======================================================================

Proposal 3534 (Blob)
Perpetual Offices

Create a new rule, entitled "Holding an Office in Perpetuity", with the
text:

   If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
   then the Speaker may declare Without Objection that the Office
   is held in perpetuity, until such time as the Player holding the
   Office changes. 

   The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
   expire.

   This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
   of an Office's Term of Service.

[v2 Changed the declaration to be Without Objection]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3535 (Blob)
Make Rebellion more interesting

Amend Rule 1664 to read:

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. A new Player is always
      Abiding when e becomes a player. A Player whose Location is the 
      Beer Hall can switch from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious
      to Abiding by sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does
      change so. The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that
      are Rebellious. This list is known as the Red Pages, and is part
      of the Registrar's Report.

      A Rebellious Player may Call for a Revolt at any time, by sending
      a message to the Public Forum saying e does so. Abiding Players may
      not Call for Revolt. If more than one Call for Revolt is made
      in a Nomic Week, only the first such Call has effect.

      As soon as possible after the posting of a Call for Revolt, the
      Registrar must determine whether the Revolt succeeds, as outlined
      below, and post the result to the Public Forum.

      The result of a Revolt is determined as follows: The Registrar
      selects a random integer from 1 to the number of Players at the
      time of the Call for Revolt. If this number is less than or equal
      to the number of Rebellious Players at the time of the Call for 
      Revolt, then the Revolt succeeds, otherwise it fails.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur (in order):

         - All Rebellious Players lose all their Blots.
         - All Rebellious Players gain 3 EVs from the Bank

         - The Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker
         - All Players that hold one or more Offices in the normal
           fashion cease to hold those in a normal fashion and hold them
           temporarily instead.
         - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

      If a Revolt does not succeed, then:

         - All Rebellious Players gain 2 Blots
         - The Player who Called for Revolt gains 1 (additional) Blot

      The Registrar is required to report all Currency and Blot transfers
      resulting from this Rule.

Create a Rule with the title "Robespierre":

      There shall exist a Patent Title of "Robespierre".
      When a Revolt succeeds, the Player who Called for the Revolt is
      awarded this Title, and any previous holder of the Title loses it.

[v1.0 The aim is to make Rebellion a bit more risky, but also to set 
      penalties so that if a Revolt does take place, you'd rather be
      on the winning side.]
[v1.1 fixed some language, added reporting requirement]
[v2.0 added Blot penalties & Patent Title]
[v2.1 toned down some of the rewards & penalties]
[v2.2 Added some language modifications suggested by Murphy]
[v2.3 Removed "At the time this Rule is created..." sentence]
[v2.4 Fiddled with the penalties again.]
[v3.0 Removed the penalty for Abiding Players, and changed the reward to 3 EVs]
[v3.1 Removed vague language about determining the result of the Revolt]
[v3.2 Changed to reflect new Agoraspace & Indulgences rules.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3536 (Steve)
A Public Voting Experiment

WHEREAS voting in Agora's long history has traditionally been by
secret ballot, and whereas it is well known to psephologists that
subtle changes in the mechanics of voting can have interesting
effects, we, the Voting Entities of Agora, do hereby resolve to conduct
the following Public Voting Experiment for the duration of a trial two-
month period, and to that end further resolve that a Rule, entitled
"A Public Voting Experiment", be created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes by Voting Entities on Proposals, Elections or Referenda,
      may only be achieved by sending a message to the Public Forum.

      This Rule shall repeal itself 60 days after it is created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3537 (Steve)
Disinterested Amendments can be Attributed

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1623 be amended by deleting from it
the text:

      All Rule Changes in a Disinterested Proposal are Unattributed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3538 (Steve)
Restore Game Balance II

[Comment: with the Judgement of CFJ 928, and the reversal of the
transfers which occurred subsequent to the passage of P3482, we
have returned to the absurdly VT-abundant environment (there are
now over 7700 VTs in circulation) which that Proposal sought,
unsuccessfully as it turned out, to correct. This time, I'm taking
no chances; I'm making RGBII enact a self-repealing Rule.]

Be it therefore resolved that a Rule, entitled "Restore Game Balance II",
be created with the following text:

      Upon the creation of this Rule, the following changes to Nomic
      Properties take place:

      (1) the number of Voting Tokens in the Bank is increased by
          the total number of Voting Tokens possessed by all Contests,
          and the number of Voting Tokens held by each Contest is
          adjusted to zero;

      (2) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Player who
          possesses more than 200 Voting Tokens is adjusted to be
          200, and to each decrease in the Voting Tokens possessed
          by these Players caused by this adjustment there corresponds 
          an equivalent increase in the number of Voting Tokens held
          by the Bank;

      (3) the number of Voting Tokens possessed by each Entity other
          than the Bank is adjusted to be one tenth of its previous
          value, and to each such decrease caused by this adjustment
          there corresponds an equivalent increase in the number of
          Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      (4) if the number of Voting Tokens possessed by any Player 
          after the adjustment performed above in (3) is less than 5,
          then the number of Voting Tokens possessed by that Player is
          adjusted to be 5, and to each such increase caused by this
          adjustment there corresponds an equivalent decrease in
          the number of Voting Tokens held by the Bank.

      All adjustments required by this Rule are detected and reported by
      the Assessor. This Rule shall repeal itself when the adjustments
      required by it are reported by the Assessor in the Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposal 3539 (Andre)
Let (most) Attitudes be known

Amend Rule 1719 to read:

      All nomics are exactly one of Neutral, Friendly, Secretly 
      Hostile and Openly Hostile. This status is known as the 
      Friendliness of a nomic.  If a nomic's Friendliness is not 
      otherwise determined, it is Neutral. Agora is Friendly.

      The Ambassador is authorized to change the Friendliness of a
      nomic Without Objection.

      The Ambassador's Report includes a list of all Neutral and
      Openly Hostile Nomics, and the Friendliness of each.

      If a Member Nomic of Internomic is Friendly, it should be
      an Ally of Agora, if it is Hostile, it should be an Enemy
      of Agora, and if it is Neutral, it should be neither an
      Enemy nor an Ally of Agora. If this situation is not true
      at any particular moment, the Ambassador must take the
      necessary steps to change Agora's Attitude As Soon As
      Possible.

Furthermore, at the moment this Proposal is adopted all Nomics that
were Hostile until then become Openly Hostile.
