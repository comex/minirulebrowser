Decision & Reasoning Judge:

Judgement: FALSE

Reasons and arguments:

The rules do not mandate what it is for entities to own or possess
Currencies.  Yet it is precisely this ability which is presupposed in
the rules and practice involved with Transfer Orders.  Therefore, we
use common sense in order to resolve this question, and conclude that
VTs can not possess VTs.

To reiterate: it is patently not common-sensical to allow units of
currency to own other units of currency.  Given the absence of
legislation specifying that this should be possible, there seems
little reason to suppose that it should be possible.

Of course, the initial language of the relevant rule about Transfer
Orders (R1598 "Transfer Orders") does suggest that a Transfer Order
can specify any entities as source and destination for the currencies
transferred.  However, subsequent language makes it clear that TOs may
only originate from entities that possess currencies.  Similarly, the
destination entity must support the notion of being "added to" (an
unfortunate phrasing, but one present in the rule: "When a Transfer
Order is executed, ... the number of units of that specified Currency
shall be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
entity."

Thankfully game custom makes a strong case for interpreting "added to"
as meaning "passes into the ownership of".  

A more literal interpretation of this phrase would allow the above
judgement to stand, but would probably invalidate all current economic
activity.  In this alternative conception, transferring 1 VT to
another VT would cause the 1 VT transferred to the destination 1VT to
be added to it, presumably resulting in 2 VTs.  Of course, one could
also create an arbitrary amount of VTs by transferring them to
themselves.  This interpretation is clearly ridiculous so I feel that
justice is being upheld in appealing to common sense and game custom
to override the peculiar wording of R1598.

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1006: An Office must be held by a Player.
Rule 790:  The Winner of the Election shall hold the Office.

This is a conflict.  Rule 790 takes precedence, so Morendil (a non-Player)
holds the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Now:

Rule 1006: An Officer is a player holding an Office.

This is an explicit definition.  There is no conflict with any other Rule,
so the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by someone who is not an Officer
(Morendil).

Rule 790:  An Office is held in the normal fashion only if held by an
_Officer_ who was elected to it (among other things).

The Office of Speaker-Elect does not satisfy this requirement.  Therefore
it is not being held in the normal fashion.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I hereby judge the statement of CFJ 1065,

  "I (the caller of this CFJ) am my own Executor.",

to be false.

Reasons and arguments:

We are dealing with an interesting question of (real and potential)
conflicts and various precedence regulations here. The rules concerned
are 1738 and 1478 (see evidence below).

1. By rule number, 1478 takes precedence in case of a conflict.

2. 1738 states "This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate." This
precedence is based on a condition: it only applies to other rules
that try to specify executors for an entity in probate. However, if
this condition is met, the _whole_ rule 1738 has precedence over the
other rule, not only the paragraph of 1738 that allows the notary to
assign executors in probate.

3. 1478 states "Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is
eir own Executor." This explicitly defers to rules that define a
player's executor to be someone else than the player emself. However,
this precedence clause only concerns the one question of who is
executor, not the rule 1478 as a whole.


Swann has been assigned an executor in probate. Thus, 1738 "stipulates
otherwise" than the default given in 1478 would; 1478 defers to the
regulations of 1738, and Swann's executor in Probate is still eir
executor. The statement of this CFJ is thus false.


There remains the interesting question of what powers this executor in
probate has. I mention this point here, because one _might_ argue as
follows:

-- 
1478 states

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
while 1738 limits the powers of an executor in Probate significantly:

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are other things the EiP can do, but clearly 1738 allows less
than 1478. Reading the sentence quoted from 1478 as a _definition_ of
"Executor", the EiP described in 1738 (who has smaller powers) cannot
be the player's executor.
-- 

However, I argue that the above argument (between the dashes, --) is
false. The sentence quoted from 1478 is not a _definition_ of
"Executor", but an assignment of certain powers to the executor. This
assignment does conflict with the, much more restricted, assignment of 
1738. 

We have seen above that 1478 does not define a different executor as
1738, so the precedence clause "This Rule takes precedence over any
other Rule which would specify a different Executor for an entity in
Probate." from 1738 does _not_ trigger, and the conflicting
assignments of power to the executor are resolved in favor of the
lower numbered rule, 1478. 

So an analysis of the argument enclosed in dashes (--) does not only
show that this argument is false (this is why I'm talking about the
issue in this Judgement), it also shows that the executor in probate
does have the large powers given to executors in 1478. The latter
point is not strictly relevant for this CFJ, but does confirm the way
we've handled the situation so far.

======================================================================

Evidence (added by Judge):
1. Rule 1738/0
2. Rule 1478/0

---
Rule 1738/0 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate.  E shall announce this
      appointment in the Public Forum.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity shall, upon eir nomination,
      arrange for the disposal of that entity's assets and debts,
      according to the procedures specified in the Probate Code, and
      shall do so in a timely manner.

      The Executor in Probate of an entity ceases to be its Executor
      in Probate when e announces, in accordance with the Probate
      Code, that the entity is no longer in Probate, or when e
      announces that e resigns as that entity's Executor in Probate.

      The Notary shall keep a record of each entity in Probate, and
      the Executor in Probate of each entity in Probate.

---
Rule 1478/2 (Power=1)
Executors

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

The rulekeepor's argument is quoted in the evidence. 

I disagree with this argument for two reasons:

- While I admit that the verb "append" would have been clearer than
the verb "add" it still is obvious to me (as a non-native speaker, of
course) that the proposal is to append the given sentence to the third
paragraph of 1632.

I therefore would like to apply 754 (as "dialect", maybe? It's not a
typo, of course) to clarify the meaning of P3575.


- I think that to call this provision ambiguous is hairsplitting at
best. While this may be considered in keeping with the spirit of Nomic
by some, I consider it a superfluous complication in this case.

Grammatically, the only sensible position for the new sentence is at
the end of the third paragraph of 1632. However, except for a weird
wording, no consequences would arise from adding the sentence at the
beginning of the paragraph. Adding it elswhere would just be nonsense. 

I do not consider the rulekeepor a mindless word processor. E is not
told how to indent the rules, either; nor are there provisions for the
form and details of annotations. In fact, even the division of rules
into paragrpahs is not mandated anywhere in the rules. So game custom
also does treat the rulekeepor not as a word processor, but as a human
player who can understand what e is doing and interpret proposals like
3575 as human language with a meaning. This is why the rulekeepor is
an officer and not a perl script, after all. While I admit that a
computer program could find P3575 ambiguous, a human shouldn't.

Kolja A.

P.S. Of course, I hope strongly that noone will feel offended by my
arguments, especially Chuck. Certainly this is not my intention. I
consider this more a question of game custom and the spirit of the
game, but wanted to resolve it formally, too, and not delay this CFJ
until the end of a lengthy discussion on a-d. I would welcome
contributions to such a discussion from everyone interested, though. 

======================================================================

Evidence:

1. Proposal 3575

3. Statement of the Rulekeepor why e refused to apply this amendment (e
   agreed to make this discussion public, so I hope e doesn't mind my

1. Proposal 3575:

Proposal 3575 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Amend 1632 by adding the following sentence to the third paragraph
(Duration of Voting):

If this leads to a Voting Period that is shorter than three days, the
Voting Period shall instead last for three days or until two days
before the InterNomic Voting Period on the relevant InterNomic
Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

[Note that, if this still does not lead to a voting period of a
positive length, the Ambassador has clearly failed to distribute the
proposal ASAP, according to 1632.]

It doesn't say where in the third paragraph the sentence is

======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals (unofficial)
======================================================================

Proposal 3577 (Zefram)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Fix Lawlessness

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1714 ("Lawlessness") be amended by
replacing the paragraph

      A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than 30 Blots.

with

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that number
      of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has more than
      30 Overdue Blots.
 
======================================================================

Proposal 3578 (Steve)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Straighten out Absence

[Comment: the last piece of the puzzle: 'Absence' itself must become
'Silence' (or, rather, 'Absent' must become 'Silent') to complete the
series suggested by 'Noisy' and 'Quiet'. I have kept the title of the
Proposal as 'Straighten out Absence' to reflect its origins, but changed
the Title of the Rule.]

[Comment: in the end, the amendment to R1016 that actually puts the
definition of 'Active' and 'Inactive' back in R1016 can remain separate,
since we all agree that 'Active' already has this definition by game
custom. Zefram's proto to amend R1016 handles this handsomely. This
version differs from Zefram's only in minor details: I prefer 'two
months' to 'eight weeks'; I have the Registrar make an announcement
if the deregistration does not occur for some reason; I include a
requirement that the Registrar note transitions between being Noisy,
Quiet and Silent.]

Be it hereby resolved that the Title of Rule 1042 be changed to
'Deregistration due to Silence', and that it be amended to read:

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

Be it further resolved that the Authors of Rule 1042 are Steve and Zefram.
