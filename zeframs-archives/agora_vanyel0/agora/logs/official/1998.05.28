======================================================================
                               CFJ 1094

  The Orders issued by Player Swann in the message entitled 'Coup
  d'état' were valid.

======================================================================
Judge:        Steve
Judgement:    TRUE
======================================================================

I accept Swann's arguments, which address the issue quite thoroughly.

In the matter of General Chaos' Motions, I am not sure if I am
permitted to take any action concerning them. This is is not due
to any uncertainty I have about the effect of Swann's later Orders 
(not the ones that are the subject of this CFJ, but the ones
contained in his message "I didn't want to do this..."); I am
satisfied that these Orders are valid and that their effect is
to prevent me from granting any of G. Chaos' Motions. But Swann's
Orders do not prevent me from denying the Motions, My concern is
rather about R1827:

      A Judge must either grant or deny each Motion forwarded to em by
      the Clerk of the Courts, within five days of when the Motion was
      received by the Judge.  E may, but need not, state the reasons
      for eir grant or denial.  A Judge grants or denies a Motion by
      sending eir determination on that Motion to the Clerk of the
      Courts, along with any reasons e chooses to provide.

General Chaos' Motions were sent to the Public Forum; they have never
been forwarded to me by the Clerk of the Courts. (CotC Michael is
technically in violation of R1023 for failing to do so.) Therefore I
do not think I am required to grant or deny them. Nevertheless, I
think I probably am permitted to deny them. Therefore, if I am
permitted by the Rules to do so, I hereby deny all three of General
Chaos' Motions.
