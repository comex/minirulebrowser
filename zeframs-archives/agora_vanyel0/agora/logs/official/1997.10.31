General Chaos has just indirectly reminded me that Zefram was Wizard
as well as Registrar when he deregistered, so we need to hold an Election
for that Office as well.

I therefore call for nominations for the Office of Wizard. The Nominating
Period will last one week, commencing as of this message.

Registrar pro-tem Steve

I hereby issue a Payment Order of 1 VT from the Bank to elJefe, being
his Judicial Salary on the Appeal of CFJ 1047.

I hereby report that I have committed the Infraction of failing to Judge
with respect to CFJ 1047's second Appeal, and issue a Payment Order of
3 Indulgences from me to the Bank.

As I seem to have lost some judicial matters, I will wait with further
actions regarding this CFJ until I have heared from Steve whether or not
he had issued a Judgement.
