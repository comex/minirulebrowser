The last Tabulator's Report that was subject to the adoption of
a VOC directive was the report published in the PF on 1996/08/13
(back when we had a Tabulator, and e was responsible for Blots).

AFAIK, no Herald's Report has ever been successfully ratified.

      in the Queue by notifying the Promotor that e does so, and
      paying a number of P-Notes to the Bank. For each P-Note e pays
      to the Bank, the Priority of the Proposal is increased or
      decreased by one as specified by the Player making the payment,

      purpose. The Priority of a Proposal may not be reduced below
      zero in this manner. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Trumpet Mk II.

Special Note:  There is no "scam" left in this proposal, Neither I or
               anyone else gains a whit from this. (Except a Patent
               Title denied me by a typo.)

Formatting Note:  The Rules created by this proposal are delimited by
"===" to help distinguish them.  The non-proposed Rule creations are
delimited by "***."  Instruments created by Rules are between quotes.


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: The Trumpet};

===

     There is an instrument known as a Trumpet.  The only Trumpets that 
     may exist are those created by the Rules created by the Proposal
     that created this Rule.  All Trumpets have a Power of 4.  Trumpets 
     are bodies of text defined by the Rules.  Trumpets have an 
     initialization clause and a resolution clause.  Rule Changes (and 
     other effects) defined in the initialization Clause of a Trumpet 
     take effect immediately after the Rule Creating the Trumpet is 
     created.  Rule Changes (and other effects) defined in the 
     resolution clause of a Trumpet take effect at the time defined in 
     the text of the Trumpet, or immediately after the initialization 
     clause takes effect if such a time is unspecified.  A Rule defining 
     a Trumpet shall be repealed as soon as all provisions in the 
     Trumpet it defines have taken effect.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:01 GMT on Aug. 1st 1998.

===

{Comment: Guess what?  Read the Ruleset Week paid off with a major
          loophole.  There is nothing to prevent a Power=1 Rule from 
          defining an instrument of arbitrary Power.  Proposals are 
          fairly well delimited, and Rules can't directly change Rules
          of higher power, but through this back door a Rule can define
          an instrument to alter any other Rule at its whim.  Ain't 
          this neat?  I've also noticed a few more loopholes
          to follow;) }


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Bonus Clauses?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1561 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Illegality of Bonus Clauses};

                ***

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.

                ***"

===

{Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to bribes to
           vote FOR or AGAINST.  I'm surprised no one exploited this 
           when Presence was created.  It's perfectly legal to bribe 
           someone to not vote at all, or declare presence, or even
           ABSTAIN.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Coercive Proposals?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1003 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: No Coercive Proposals};

               ***

               Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a 
               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
               ***"

===

{Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to coercing
           a vote, not a declaration of presence &c.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: Slamming shut the back door.}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
           The following rule is created with an Power=3
           (text delimited by "***")
           {Title: What I get out of this.};

                ***

                Player Swann gains the Patent Title of "Loose Cannon."

                This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on Aug. 
                1st 1998.

                ***

      Resolution Clause (to take effect immediately before 00:00:00 GMT
      on Aug. 1st 1998) ;
      
          Let the following rule be created with an Power=3
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Limits on the Power of Instruments};

               ***

               No instrument can create another instrument with a Power 
               greater than its own Power.  This Rule takes precedence 
               over any Rule that specifies the Power of the created
               instrument.  Proposals are explicitly exempt from this
               provision.

               In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
               a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
               Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
               Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
               Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
               effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
               Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

               If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
               specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the 
               Power of the new instrument is 1.

               ***"

Leftover Loophole Cleaning

Rule 1766 is amended to read as follows;

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes AGAINST
      that Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by a Voting Entity.

Plot Repair

Create a Rule entitled "Plots" with this text:

      There is a class of entities called Plots.  All Plots are initially
      owned by the Bank.

      Each Plot has a unique name.  A Plot's owner may change its name
      Without Objection.

Create a Rule entitled "Adjacency" with this text:

      Each Plot has a Longitude and Latitude, each of which is an integer.
      Two Plots are Adjacent if and only if one of the following applies:

        * They have the same Longitude, and their Latitudes differ by one.
        * They have the same Latitude, and their Longitudes differ by one.

      For each combination of Latitude (X) from 0 to 9 and Longitude (Y)
      from 0 to 9:

        * If a Plot named "Area XY" (substituting the Latitude for "X" and the
          Longitude for "Y") already exists, its Latitude and Longitude are set to
          X and Y, respectively.
        * If no such Plot exists, then a Plot with that name, Latitude and
          Longitude is created.

Create a Rule entitled "The Cartographor" with this text:

     There is an Office of Cartographor. The Cartographor recieves a
      salary equal to 2 times the Basic Officer Salary.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a
      Report to the Public Forum containing the following information:

        * the name, ownership, and Adjacency of all Plots
        * the ownership, assignment (if any) and Type of all Structures
        * the ownership of all Ergs
        * all changes in ownership of Plots since the last Report
        * all changes in ownership, assignment, or Type of all Structures
          since the last Report
        * all Transfer Orders and Payment Orders specifying Ergs since the
          last Report

Be it hereby resolved that R1784 be amended by replacing in it the text
which currently reads:

      In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e
      gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

with text which reads:

Fix Transfer Orders

Amend Rule 1799 by replacing the text:

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it.

with the text:

      Any Order, except a Transfer Order, may always be amended, stayed,
      or vacated by the Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders,
      Board of Appeal) who executed it.  A Delayed Transfer Order may be
      amended, stayed or vacated by the Player who executed it only
      during the time in which it is delayed.

Amend Rule 1598 by appending the sentence:

      If a Transfer Order purports to satisfy a particular Payment Order
      and either that Payment Order does not exist or cannot be
      satisfied by the Transfer Order, then the Transfer Order is
      invalid.

Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
No Presence

[Comment: the other idea I've had to increase VT expenditure, apart
from secret voting, is the regularly raised idea of getting rid of
Presence. In conjunction with secret voting, this might be especially
effective, since secret voting would make the tactic of not voting on
a Proposal you dislike much more dangerous. As with my other Proposals
in this area, what I propose is a two month trial.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 1715 (Announcing One's Presence) be
amended by appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
A Secret Voting Experiment

[Comment: I can think of couple of ways to encourage expenditure
of VTs above the minimum required to pass a Proposal. Here's one
of them: secret voting. If Players can't be sure if a Proposal
they like has met Quorum and has at least 3 supporters, they'll
have to think harder about supporting it themselves. (And similarly
for Proposals they don't like.) We've had 6 months of public voting,
and it's been interesting and fun, but maybe a couple of months of
secret voting might be equally interesting and fun! Anyway, the
approach I've taken here is the same as that which I took when
introducing the Public Voting Experiment back in November of last
year: a 2 month trial with a built-in sunset clause. If secret
voting doesn't have the effect of increasing VT expenditure, or
if it has other effects we don't like, we just let the trial period
expire and go back to our current system.]

Be it hereby resolved that R1764 (Public Voting) be amended by
appending to it a paragraph which reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, shall have no effect.
      Two months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that Rule entitled "Secret Voting" be
created with the following text:

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Vote Collector of the Proposal,
      Election, or Referendum only. (Players are, however, permitted
      to send or copy such messages to themselves.) 

      A Player who sends a message containing votes on a Proposal,
      Election or Referendum to the Public Forum, prior to the
      conclusion of the Voting Period of that Proposal, Election, or
      Referendum, commits the Infraction of Public Voting. The
      commission of this Infraction is to be detected and reported by
      the Vote Collector; the penalty is 1 Voting Token and 1 Blot.

      Two months after it is created, this Rule repeals itself.

Proposal  (Steve) AI = 1
Permit Electioneering!

[Comment: as a companion to my Secret Voting Experiment proto, a
proto to permit Electioneering. This would be proposed at the same
time as 'A Secret Voting Experiment', but would be a separate
Proposal. The idea may seem outrageous, but I think it has merit.
We've been busily giving all kinds of interesting powers to the
Promotor, the Chancellor and the Speaker (and I've just proposed
some for the Accountor, too) - why not give some real power to the
Assessor and the Registrar, and make these Offices *really*
attractive and important?]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 452 (Prohibit Electioneering by
Vote Collectors) be amended by appending to it a paragraph which
reads:

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Be it further resolved that Rule 1625 (Secrecy of Voting) be
amended by appending to it a paragraph which reads: 

      This Rule, apart from this paragraph, has no effect. Two
      months after this paragraph is added to this Rule, this
      paragraph shall be deleted from this Rule.

Reinstate unemployment benefits

[Comment: the current VT supply situation for non-Officers is most unfair.
P3741 passed, repealing unemployment benefits, but being crippled by the
passage of P3740, no other source of VTs has replaced them, leaving non-
Officers with no reliable income at all. At least util we sort out what
we're going to do with Plots, we should reinstate unemployment benefits.
I've also used this opportunity to propose a minor tweak to R1670 (The
Distributor) to bring it under the control of LMP.]

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "Unemployment Benefits", be
created with the following text:

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the
      Registrar shall pay out to every Player who did not receive any
      Officer's Salary for the previous week an unemployment benefit
      of half the Basic Officer Salary.

Be it further resolved that R1670 (The Distributor) be amended by 
replacing in it the text which currently reads:

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, at the
      beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out one Voting Token to the
      Distributor, in recognition of eir service.

with text which reads:

      If the Distributor is a Player, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after the beginning of each Nomic Week, pay out to the
      Distributor Voting Tokens equivalent to the Basic Officer
      Salary, in recognition of eir service.

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ombudsman Mk II

Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman)

     There is a Patent Title of Ombudsman.  This title shall be awarded 
     in the following ways;

       i) If the prior Ombudsman designates an eligible successor, then 
          the Player designated by the Ombudsman is awarded the title.

      ii) If a referendum is called to award the title to an eligible 
          Player, then upon the passage of that referendum the title is 
          awarded to that Player.

     iii) If no Ombudsman exists, then the Speaker shall, in the Public 
          Forum, call for volunteers from amongst all eligible Players.  
          One week from this call, the speaker shall select one of the
          elgible voulenteers at random to become the new Ombudsman.

     Whenever a player is awarded the title of Ombudsman, that title is 
     removed from all prior holders.

     The player holding the title of Ombudsman shall be known as the 
     Ombudsman.

     If an Ombudsman ceases to be a Player, then eir title is removed.

{Comment: The Ombudsman isn't an Office, and it's only an elected
          position in certian rare curcumstances.  The idea is to create
          an advocate for the less powerful Players.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Elgibility to be Ombudsman)

     In order to be eligible to be the Ombudsman, the following must be 
     true of a Player;

       i) The Player must hold no Office nor be the Speaker.
      ii) The Player must not be On Hold.
     iii) The Player must not be Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group.
      iv) The Player has no Blots.

     If any of these conditions become false of any Ombudsman, that 
     Player has a period of 14 days to either correct the situation or 
     designate a willing successor in the Public Forum. If the Ombudsman
     fails to do either within the 14 day period, then the Title of 
     Ombudsman is immediately removed from that Player.

{Comment: The prerequisites of the Ombudsman exist to prevent eim from
          becoming part of a coalition.  E is intended to be 
          independent.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Designating a Successor Ombudsman)

     At any time, an Ombudsman is permitted to designate an eligible 
     player to succeed him as Ombudsman.  E must do this in the Public 
     Forum.  To be successful, this designation must be of a willing 
     player.

     If a successor is designated, and that Player is eligible to be the 
     Ombudsman, and that Player consents to be the Ombudsman in the 
     Public Forum within three days of the designation, then that Player 
     is awarded the title of Ombudsman either upon the designation, or 
     upon eir consent, whichever is later.

{Comment: This is intended to be the basic mechanisim for changing 
          Ombudsmen.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Referendum to replace the Ombudsman)

     Any Player can call for a referendum to replace the Ombudsman.  The 
     Player must make this call in the Public Forum, and the Referendum 
     must name an eligible Player to replace the current Ombudsman.  For 
     the referendum to begin, the named Player must consent in the 
     Public Forum within the two days immediately after the call.  If 
     the named Player consents, then the voting period begins as of the 
     consent.

     The default procedure for referenda changes as follows;  Vote 
     collector is the Player who called for the referendum.  Voting 
     entities only include players who hold no Office and are not the 
     Vizier or Ordinancekeepor of any Group, and who are not the
     Speaker.

     If the referendum passes, the named player becomes Ombudsman, if it 
     fails, the referendum has no effect.

{Comment: This is the recourse to deal with an Ombudsman who doesn't 
          perform to the ideals of the position.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Duties and Responsibilities of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman is responsible for being the voice of the people of 
     Agora.  His duties, broadly defined, are as follows;

       i) To help new Players acclimate to Agora by providing mentoring
          and guidance.
      ii) To hear grievances by the Players and bring them to the 
          attention of Officers and the Speaker.
     iii) To fight injustice insofar as the powers of the Ombudsman 
          allow.
      iv) To be an impartial and independent representative for all the
          Players of Agora.

     Other Rules shall define the specifics of these duties and 
     responsibilities.

{Comment: The broad outlines of what the Ombudsman is for. }


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Grievance Report)

     The Ombudsman has the responsibility to hear confidential 
     grievances from any Player about the game of Agora. The Ombudsman 
     shall regularly poll the people of Agora, with special attention to 
     those Players who hold no Office, and solicit their grievances.  In 
     addition, any Player with a grievance can submit their grievances 
     to the Ombudsman without being polled.  These grievances need not 
     be matters of law (which are subjects of the courts) but can be 
     manners of style, culture, fairness, and anything else that affects 
     a Player's ability to participate in Agora and enjoy doing so.

     Every week, the Ombudsman shall publish an Official Grievance 
     Report listing grievances e has received since the last such 
     report.  This report shall not give out the names of the Players 
     with these grievances unless the Player with the grievance 
     explicitly states that eir name is to be attached to the report, 
     otherwise all grievances given to the Ombudsman shall be 
     confidential and shall never be revealed.  This rule takes 
     precedence over any rule that would require or permit the Ombudsman 
     to violate this confidentiality.

{Comment: I think this would be useful, especially in times of crisis.
          Having an anonymous forum to vent might help with a historical 
          problem where Players have felt that their complaints about 
          the game resulted in personal attacks upon them.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: The Ombudsman's Duty to New and Inexperienced Players)

     Upon the registration of any new Player the Ombudsman shall 
     communicate to that Player, as soon as possible, the fact that the 
     Ombudsman exists to be a mentor to that Player.  The Ombudsman 
     shall also provide the following services to any Player.

       i) To the best of eir ability answer any question about Agora. 
      ii) To assist any player in understanding the mechanics of a given 
          action (submitting/judging a CFJ, submitting a Proposal, 
          manipulating currency, and so on.)
     iii) To direct a player's query to the appropriate Officer. (Such 
          as FOIA requests and so on.)
      iv) Provide advice to any player who needs it.

{Comment: This is meant to be a replacement for the late Welcome Wagon,
          which never got rolling.  I think it would be nice for newbies 
          (and others) can have a centralized authority to consult 
          with in trying to play this increasingly complex game.}


Let the following rule be created;
(Title: Special Privileges of the Ombudsman)

     The Ombudsman shall have the following rights and privileges, to be 
     exercised only in the spirit of advocacy for *all* Agorans;

       i) Once every month, the Ombudsman is permitted and empowered to 
          vacate up to five Blots belonging a single individual Player.
          This must only be done to correct what the Ombudsman believes 
          to be an injustice to an otherwise Rule-abiding Player.

      ii) The Ombudsman is permitted to cast an additional two votes 
          AGAINST any proposal e believes disenfranchises a large number 
          of Players,  distributes power unfairly, or adversely affects 
          a large class of Players who do not themselves have the 
          resources to oppose.

     iii) The Ombudsman has the power to, once a week, pay out one of 
          any currency, other than an Indulgence, minted by the Bank to
          any single Player who has none of that currency.

      iv) If the Ombudsman Rebels, e counts as three players toward a
          Revolt.

     In addition, the Ombudsman shall receive a weekly stipend equal to 
     1.5 times the Basic Officer Salary, to be paid out by the 
     Registrar.

{Comment: These powers are designed to help the Ombudsman in eir
          duties.  I tweaked them a little so there's less a chance of
          unbalancing Blots.}

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Revamp New Player Incentives.

Rule 1677 is amended to read as follows;

     Upon commencement of a new Player's Grace period, the Registrar 
     shall pay out to that Player 3 VTs and 1 P-Note.

{Comment: Followed Oerjan's suggestion, giving newbies a Blot amnesty
          rather than an Indulgence.  Note, I lowered the award.}
          

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Blot Amnesty During the Grace Period)

     If a Player is subject to an Infraction during eir Grace period, e 
     shall not be billed any Indulgences due to that Infraction.  This 
     Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would require or permit 
     that Player to be billed for those Indulgences.

     If the Rules specify a Player receive a specific number of Blots* 
     and those Blots are not the result of a Crime* and those Blots are 
     to be applied during that Player's Grace period, then those Blots 
     shall not be applied. This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that 
     would require or permit that Player to receive those Blots.

{Comment: Instead of giving the new Player an Indulgence, this makes 
          them partially immune to Blots* with the exception of Crimes, 
          which are a rare and grave matter.}


Rule 1701 is amended by deleting the following phrase;

     "Whenever a Player registers who has never before possessed any
      P-Notes, the Promotor shall pay out 5 P-Notes to that Player."

{Comment: Moved it to 1677.}


Let the following Rule be created;
(Title: Grace Period Proposals)

     If a Proposal has been submitted by a Player during eir Grace 
     Period then that Proposal shall have an initial Priority of one.  
     This Rule takes precedence over Rules that specify a different 
     initial Priority.

Rule 1442 is amended to read as follows;

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity a
      number of Voting Tokens equal to the votes cast on that
      Proposal by that entity.

      However, If the votes were cast by a Player during eir Grace 
      period, then the Assessor shall instead bill that Player a number 
      of Voting Tokens equal to half the votes cast by that Player.

{Comment: These are both intended to serve the same purpose as giving a
          newbie some starting currency, without flooding the market 
          with VTs and P-Notes.  Also, a shrewd newbie has the 
          opportunity to raise capital by selling eir cheaper actions at 
          a profit.}

Repeal a Pointless Rule

Rule 1692 is hereby Repealed.

{Comment: Does anyone believe that a Power one rule can effectively
restrict the Power of any Rule with Higher Precedence?}

Let the following Rule be created;
(Title:Minimum Power of Rules}

     All Rules shall have a Power of one or greater.  No Rule shall have 
     a Power less than one.  This Rule takes precedence over all other 
     Rules.

{Comment: This should be (more) effective.}

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Ratification and Reporting Tweaks

NOTE: What this does is attempt to smooth out a lot of nasty confusions 
in the Ratification process.  Because of a number of authors over the 
past couple of years, some ambiguity and a few outright contradictions 
crept in.  I've fixed the following; The Official Report/Officer's 
Report/Official Document confusion.  There are now Officer's Reports, 
which are Official Documents, and Official Documents, which are defined 
broadly by 1552.  I've also rewritten the rules to allow mechanisms 
other than proposals to Ratify Documents, permitting Ratification w/o 
Objection to actually work.


Rule 1686 is amended to read as follows;

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Documents.  The only information that is part of an
      Officer's Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Officer's Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Officer's Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Officer's Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorized to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.


Let the following Rule be Created;
(Title: Initiation and Execution of Ratification)

     Whenever an Official Document is Ratified, there is a time at which 
     the Ratification is Initiated, and a time the Ratification is 
     Executed.

     In the case of Ratification Without Objection, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the appropriate Officer posts the intent to Ratify 
     in the Public Forum, and the Ratification is Executed when the 
     appropriate Officer makes a valid (as defined in other Rules) post 
     that the Ratification has been made.

     In the case of a Ratification by Proposal, the Ratification is 
     Initiated when the Proposal to Ratify is submitted to the Promotor, 
     and it is Executed when that Proposal is passed.

     If other Rules define alternative methods of Ratifying Official 
     Documents, they must define when Ratifications via those methods 
     are Initiated and Executed, otherwise those methods cannot be used 
     to Ratify any Official Documents.  This Rule takes precedence over 
     any Rule that contradicts its provisions.

     When a Ratification is Executed, the Execution is successful 
     and the Document is Ratified, if, and only if, the Official 
     Document it specifies is still one that is legally valid for 
     Ratification upon such Execution.


Rule 1552 is amended to read as follows;

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time Ratification is Initiated:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid before Ratification is
      Executed if any of the following occurs before that time:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, before a Ratification of a Document is Executed, another
       Document is issued that does not contradict the prior Document, 
       it does not alter the validity of the prior Document.


Rule 1550 is amended to read as follows;

     Ratification of an Official Document shall only be Executed if the 
     Ratification was Initiated via procedures explicitly defined in the 
     Rules and the Ratification explicitly specified a valid Official 
     Document it Ratifies.

     It shall always be permissible to Ratify any valid Official 
     Document by the operation of an adopted Proposal.

     This Rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow a 
     Ratification to be executed in contradiction of its requirements.


Rule 1551 is amended to read as follows;

      Sucessful Execution of a Ratification of an Official Document
      conforms the Game State to what it would be if the valid Official 
      Document thus ratified was completely true and accurate at the 
      time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.  In other 
      words, the State of the Game, upon such Execution, becomes that
      specified within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes 
      between the time of its publication and its Ratification was 
      Executed.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such Execution; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Order.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After Ratification of a Document is sucessfully Executed, the
      Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all 
      subsequent publications of that Document with the date of 
      publication of the last such publication that was ratified..

Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
Allow Dynamic and/or Conditional AI's

Rule 594 is amended by changing the words,
     "requested by its Proposer (if any)"
to read,
     "specified in the Proposal (if any)"

{Comment: A minor change, but allows a proposal to be conditional-- ie. 
          "The AI of this Proposal is 3 if the Voting Index it achieves 
          is greater than three, and 1 otherwise."}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Swann) AI = 1
We Know when the ROM Submits the @#$!% Proposal

Rule 1753 is amended by deleting the following paragraph;

     "For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule."

{Comment: The ROM Rule has been amended to have the Promotor explicitly
          submit the ROM's Proposals to the PF, a much more natural time 
          of submission.}

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal  (Repeal-O-Matic) AI = 1
Repeal Rule 1766 (The Officer's Vote)

Rule 1766 is hereby Repealed.

Accountor's Report as of 19 May 1998

Blob take note, your last attempt to transfer 3 VTs to the Bank failed because
it was executed prior to Chancellor Michael's replacement transfers.  Please
resubmit.

Note also that Harlequin is guilty of Debt Voting for VT2263 and Persistent
Indebtedness for VT2232 and VT2263.  I hereby order Harlequin to pay one
Indulgence to the Bank.

I hereby order the Assessor to deny voting privileges to Harlequin for a period
of two weeks beginning Monday, May 25, 1998.

Report attached - too big to fit.

I = Insane

======================================================================
Proposal 3749 (Steve) AI = 1
The Levers of Monetary Policy

[Comment: this Proposal introduces two new levers for control over
monetary policy: it gives the Accountor the ability, by levying
taxes, to keep the number of VTs in circulation limited to what I
have called the Voting Token Circulation Level, which e can set, and
it give the Chancellor the power to set the Basic Officer Salary. The
aim here is to give us flexibility; we can adjust important economic
parameters without having to pass a Proposal. Also, these decisions
then become a matter of Officer politics, which should be interesting.
I have written the Taxation Rule so that it covers the cases of other
Currencies, should we wish to extend the use of this tool to cover them.]

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Circulation of Voting
Tokens" be created with the following text:

      An amount of Currency is in circulation if it exists and is not
      possessed by the Bank.

      The Voting Token Circulation Level is a number which indicates
      an approximate upper limit on how many Voting Tokens per Player
      are in circulation.

      The Accountor can set the Voting Token Circulation Level by
      announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 and 15 inclusive, and that
      the Voting Token Circulation Level has not already been set by
      a similar such announcement earlier in the Week.

      The Accountor is responsible for ensuring that the number of
      Voting Tokens per Player in circulation does not exceed the
      Voting Token Circulation Level. To this end, at any time at
      which the number of Voting Tokens per Player in circulation
      does exceed the Voting Token Circulation Level, but only at
      such a time, the Accountor is empowered and required to levy a
      tax on Voting Tokens, as described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "Levying Taxes" be created
with the following text:

      When (and only when) a Player is empowered to levy a tax on a
      Currency, e may do so by announcing the levy in the Public
      Forum. The announcement must specify which Currency the tax in
      being levied on (and this must be a Currency on which the Player
      making the announcement is empowered to levy a tax), and the
      amount of the levy, expressed as a percentage of holdings of
      that Currency, not in excess of fifty percent, which each
      entity in possession of that Currency will be required to pay
      to the Bank (the levy must be the same for all entities).
      Finally, the announcement must contain Payment Orders naming
      each entity in possession of the named Currency as payor, and
      with the Bank as payee, for an amount of the named Currency
      equal to the amount of the levy. 

Be it further resolved that R1007 (Salaries of Officers) be amended
by replacing in it the text which currently reads 

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.

with text which reads 

      There is a Basic Officer Salary, equal to a number of Voting
      Tokens, the level of which is set by the Chancellor, as
      described in other Rules.

Be it further resolved that a Rule entitled "The Chancellor can set
the Basic Officer Salary" be created with the following text:

      The Chancellor can set the level of the Basic Officer Salary
      by announcing in the Public Forum that e is doing so, provided
      that e announces a value between 0 VTs and 2 VTs inclusive,
      that e makes the announcement before midnight GMT Thursday, and
      that the Basic Officer Salary has not already been set by a
      similar such announcement earlier in the Week. 

======================================================================
Proposal 3750 (Swann) AI = 1
Trumpet Mk II.

Special Note:  There is no "scam" left in this proposal, Neither I or
               anyone else gains a whit from this. (Except a Patent
               Title denied me by a typo.)

Formatting Note:  The Rules created by this proposal are delimited by
"===" to help distinguish them.  The non-proposed Rule creations are
delimited by "***."  Instruments created by Rules are between quotes.


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: The Trumpet};

===

     There is an instrument known as a Trumpet.  The only Trumpets that 
     may exist are those created by the Rules created by the Proposal
     that created this Rule.  All Trumpets have a Power of 4.  Trumpets 
     are bodies of text defined by the Rules.  Trumpets have an 
     initialization clause and a resolution clause.  Rule Changes (and 
     other effects) defined in the initialization Clause of a Trumpet 
     take effect immediately after the Rule Creating the Trumpet is 
     created.  Rule Changes (and other effects) defined in the 
     resolution clause of a Trumpet take effect at the time defined in 
     the text of the Trumpet, or immediately after the initialization 
     clause takes effect if such a time is unspecified.  A Rule defining 
     a Trumpet shall be repealed as soon as all provisions in the 
     Trumpet it defines have taken effect.

     This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:01 GMT on Aug. 1st 1998.

{Comment: Guess what?  Read the Ruleset Week paid off with a major
          loophole.  There is nothing to prevent a Power=1 Rule from 
          defining an instrument of arbitrary Power.  Proposals are 
          fairly well delimited, and Rules can't directly change Rules
          of higher power, but through this back door a Rule can define
          an instrument to alter any other Rule at its whim.  Ain't 
          this neat?  I've also noticed a few more loopholes
          to follow;) }


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Bonus Clauses?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1561 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Illegality of Bonus Clauses};

                ***

                Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players 
                to vote in a specified manner, declare presence, not 
                vote, or buyback quorum on a Proposal (either itself or 
                another Proposal) shall be completely without effect, 
                even if it is adopted, any Rule to the contrary 
                notwithstanding.

                ***"

===

{Comment:  1561 is woefully out of date.  It only applies to bribes to
           vote FOR or AGAINST.  I'm surprised no one exploited this 
           when Presence was created.  It's perfectly legal to bribe 
           someone to not vote at all, or declare presence, or even
           ABSTAIN.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: What Coercive Proposals?}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
          Rule 1003 is repealed.

      Resolution clause (to take effect 24 hours after the adoption of
      the Proposal creating the Rule that created this Trumpet);

          The following Rule is created with a Power=2
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: No Coercive Proposals};

               ***

               Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a 
               Player or set of Players into voting, not voting,
               declaring presence, or buying back quorum against eir 
               conscience shall not take effect even if adopted, any 
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.
               
               ***"

===

{Comment:  Again, guess what, the current Rule only applies to coercing
           a vote, not a declaration of presence &c.}


Let the following Rule be created (text delimited by "===")
{Title: Slamming shut the back door.}

===

     This Rule creates a Trumpet with the following quoted text;

     "Initialization Clause;
           The following rule is created with an Power=3
           (text delimited by "***")
           {Title: What I get out of this.};

                ***

                Player Swann gains the Patent Title of "Loose Cannon."

                This Rule shall repeal itself at 00:00:00 GMT on Aug. 
                1st 1998.

                ***

      Resolution Clause (to take effect immediately before 00:00:00 GMT
      on Aug. 1st 1998) ;
      
          Let the following rule be created with an Power=3
          (text delimited by "***")
          {Title: Limits on the Power of Instruments};

               ***

               No instrument can create another instrument with a Power 
               greater than its own Power.  This Rule takes precedence 
               over any Rule that specifies the Power of the created
               instrument.  Proposals are explicitly exempt from this
               provision.

               In the specific case of Proposals, a Proposal shall have
               a Power equal to its Adoption Index.  In no case shall a
               Proposal take effect unless its Voting Index exceeds its
               Adoption Index, (or equals it in the case both equal
               Unanimity) and the Rules otherwise permit it to take
               effect.  A Proposal cannot create an instrument with a
               Power that exceeds the Proposal's Power.

               If an instrument creates another instrument, and fails to
               specify a legal Power for the created instrument, the 
               Power of the new instrument is 1.

               ***"

Proposal 3751 (Blob) AI = 1
Encourage Bigger Groups

Amend Rule 1752 ("Group Votes") to read:

      If a given Group is a Voting Entity, then it shall be entitled
      to cast Vote(s) only as specified by its Ordinances.  If the
      Ordinances of the Group do not specify how the Group shall cast
      its Vote(s), it may not do so.

      A Group is not entitled to cast Votes on a Proposal if it did
      not exist at the beginning of the Voting Period of that
      Proposal.

      A Group with fewer than three Members is not entitled to cast
      Votes. 

      A Group with three or four Members may cast 2 Votes. 
      A Group with five or six Members may cast 3 Votes.
      A Group with seven or eight Members may cast 4 Votes.
      A Group with nine or more Members may cast 5 Votes.

      The Vizier of a Group is responsible to communicate the Group's
      Votes to the Assessor.
