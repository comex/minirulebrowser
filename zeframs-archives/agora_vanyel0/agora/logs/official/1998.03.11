That is right.  The report should have read:
=====================================================================

                               CFJ 1086

     "The Proposal submitted by Crito with title Cantus Cygneus, claimed
      to be a Silly Proposal, is not, in fact, a Silly Proposal."


======================================================================

Judge:       Harlequin
Judgement:   FALSE

Eligible:    Blob, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, General Chaos, Harlequin, Jester,
             Kolja A., Michael, Murphy, Oerjan, Sherlock, Steve, Swann,
             Time Agent

Ineligible:
Caller:      Morendil
Barred:
On request:
On hold:


======================================================================
History:

  Called by Morendil, 21 Feb 1998 03:30:27 +0100
  Assigned to Harlequin, 23 Feb 1998 12:55:16 +0000
  Harlequin goes On Hold, 03 Mar 1998 09:49:45 -0500
  Judged FALSE, 06 Mar 1998 23:08:17 -0500


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

R&A : firstly, I contend that Crito's pun, while able to elicit a
brief groan, is not "truly hideous". Secondly, I submit that the
Proposal *contains* a pun, but does not, as a whole, *consist of* a
pun, as required by the Silly Proposal Rule.


======================================================================
Judge's Argument:

I will adress the second point first. While it is true that this proposal
does not, in the most specific sense, completely consist of a single "truly
hideous" pun, I do not agree that this is the proper measure of whether a
Silly Proposal is indeed Silly. As evidence, I submit any number of
previous Silly Proposals, which required a short "setup" beforehand, which
provides the context which allows for the "truly hideous" pun. In this
case, the other paragraphs of the Proposal were required to provide the
context of the pun.

I will now adress the first point raised by the caller. In an issue as
subjective as this, it is difficult for anyone to make a judgement that
will be accepted by anyone, and I am loath to decide just what "truly
hideous" means in this case. Therefore, I am inclined to give the Silly
Proposer the benefit of the doubt: as almost any proposal which contains a
pun that could elicit such a groan, could reasonably be called "truly
hideous," in my judicial opinion, any such proposal should qualify as a
Silly Proposal.


======================================================================

Regards,
-- elJefe, Clerk of the Courts of Agora Nomic
