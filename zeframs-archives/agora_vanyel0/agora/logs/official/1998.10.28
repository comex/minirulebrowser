======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

None.

======================================================================
Judge's Arguments:

I hereby enter a summary Judgement of FALSE, based on Rule 1768.
Blob's report of the Commissions of the Infraction pursuant to which
the abovementioned PO was issued falls under the purview of that
Rule, and as such creates a presumption of truth which may only be
set aside "by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary".
Furthermore, the Statement makes no allegations that could be
construed to relate to the commission of a Crime or the violation of
a Rule, and as such does not call for "beyond reasonable doubt"
inquiry under Rule 1575.

Surveying the official record (supplied Caller's arguments, of which
there are none) as well as the unofficial record (Caller's statement
mentioning the number of VTs controlled as of the date of the
Infraction Report, which is besides the point - as the number of VTs
controlled at the time the relevant Proposals were published is the
determining criterion; Caller's statement of ignorance of the number
e actually controls) does not in my opinion constitute "clear and
convincing evidence" of error on the part of the Assessor.

I share to some extent the Caller's reservations about the propriety
of the Assessor's action, but I am afraid that in this instance the
burden of proof is on them.

======================================================================
Evidence attached by the CotC:

Rule 1863/0 (Power=1)
A Duty to Vote

      An Active Player with effective control of more than three
      Voting Tokens at the time a batch of Proposals is distributed,
      who is not denied Voting Privileges at that time, who is Active
      at the end of the Voting Period of the Proposal in the batch
      whose Voting Period finishes latest, and who fails to cast a
      vote on any Proposal in the batch, commits the Infraction of
      Failing to Vote, to be detected and reported by the Assessor.
      The penalty for commission of this Infraction is 1 VT.

      Effective control of an asset (eg. a unit of Currency) is the
      ability to dispose of that asset as one wishes. The Assessor is
      empowered to make determinations as to whether a Player has
      effective control over a particular asset at a particular time.
      Such determinations are defeasible and may be overturned by the
      Courts.

      Three months after this Rule is created, this Rule shall repeal
      itself.


Rule 1768/0 (Power=1)
Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3798 (Macross) AI = 1
A Duty to Propose

Be it hereby resolved that a Rule, entitled "A Duty to Propose", be
created with the following text:

      Every Player has a Public Service Status which takes exactly one
      of the values: Served, or Required to Serve. Initially, every
      Player's Status is Served. The Promotor shall maintain a list of
      all Players, including for each Player eir Public Service Status,
      and the date at which eir Status last changed to Served, or the
      date at which e last submitted a Proposal, whichever is later. The
      list shall be sorted on this date, from earliest to latest, with
      ties being broken alphabetically. The Promotor shall include this
      list in eir Promotor's Report.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each Week, the Promotor
      shall select the two Active Players not in their Grace Periods
      highest on the list (at the time of selection) who are not already
      Required to Serve, and change their Statuses from Served to
      Required to Serve, by announcing this change in the Public Forum.

      Any Player who is Required to Serve continuously for 14 days has
      their Status changed to Served and commits the Infraction of
      Failure to Propose, incurring a penalty of 1 Blot and 1 P-Note, to
      be detected and reported by the Promotor.

      Whenever any Player submits a Proposal, eir Public Service Status
      changes to (or remains as) Served.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Proposal 3799 (Blob) AI = 1
Make all Proposals Public

Amend Rule 1483 by replacing the text "to the Promotor" with "to
the Public Forum".

Amend Rule 1771 by replacing the text "by notifying the Promotor" 
with "by announcing to the Public Forum".

[Comment: Encourage P-Note spending by making the whole thing more
 public, giving players more opportunity to spend P-Notes to raise 
 or lower Priorities.]
