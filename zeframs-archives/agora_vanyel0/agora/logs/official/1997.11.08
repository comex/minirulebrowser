======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Okay, I'll admit it, I'm too lazy to go through and exhaustively 
check the ruleset, but I'm pretty sure that Harlequin is guilty of 
not completed my Probate in a timely fashion. Therefore, in order to 
attempt to get out of Probate in time to reregister sometime soon, I 
make the following CFJ (even though I doubt it will help much):

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I find that when Antimatter deregistered on 10 September he had no
currencies of any kind (noone did).  Thus he was never placed in Probate by
Rule 1601.  Unless the Rules authorize the Notary to place people into
Probate arbitrarily, or to appoint an EiP for entities not in Probate
(which I doubt), I find that the Notary's attempted appointment of
Harlequin as EiP had no effect.

Thus Harlequin is not an Executor in Probate for Antimatter.

I do note that Morendil _did_ possess currencies when he was deregistered,
and so Harlequin's appointment as EiP for Morendil (on 27 October) was
effective.

Though the actions required of the EiP are straightforward, I find that
Rule 1738 requires "timely" action rather than "as soon as possible".  It
would be unreasonable to hold that 8 days of inaction was a violation.
Thus Harlequin did not violate Rule 1738 here either.
