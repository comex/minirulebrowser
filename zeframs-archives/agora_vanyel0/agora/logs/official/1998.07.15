I figure that, one way or another, I am currently Cartographor.
Either because:
    a) As Speaker, I declared Steve to be the Winner of the
       Election, and he delegated the Office to me.
    b) As Speaker, Steve declared himself to be Winner of the
       Election, and he delegated the Office to me.
    c) The Election had no Winner, another Election must be 
       called, and in the meantime I continue to hold the 
       Office as I did before the Election.
So:

   3772 Swann          1 Repeal a Pointless Rule 

Style Change: -1

Repealing a rule and creating a new one in its place is bad form.

   3773 Swann          1 We Know when the ROM Submits the @#$!% Proposal 

Style Change: 0

Removing an ugly phrase is probably worth 0.5 Style Points, but is not 
enough to warrant a whole point.

   3774 Crito          1 Making On Hold Safe Again

Style Change: 0

A bit wordy, but not enough to warrant a penalty.
