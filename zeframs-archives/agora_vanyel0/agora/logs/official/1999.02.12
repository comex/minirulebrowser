Fellow Agorans,

It is my sad duty today to issue a Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima
Exprobratione against Andre, commanding that he be deregistered as of
this message. In accordance with R1789, I instruct the Registrar to note
in eir Report that Andre has deregistered in a Writ of FAGE.

Below is Andre's Cantus Cygneus.

Clerk of the Courts Steve
