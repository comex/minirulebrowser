======================================================================
Score Changes
======================================================================

I hereby order to Scorekeepor to increase Kolja's Score by 3 Points
for having voted on more than three Proposals in a week, in accordance
with R1784.

======================================================================
Text of Adopted Proposals
======================================================================
Proposal 3720 (Steve) AI = 1
Tweak R833

[Comment: the current version of R833 makes the timing of the POs
awkward for the Assessor, who may have to refer back to previous
Reports to determine which Proposals were adopted in the previous
week.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 833 have its Title changed to
"Reward for Getting a Proposal Passed" and that it be amended
to read:

      As soon as possible after an Interested Proposal submitted by a
      Player is adopted, the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens
      to that Player, with the proviso that no more than one such
      payment shall be made to any Player under the authority of this
      Rule for adopted Proposals distributed at the same time.

======================================================================
Proposal 3721 (Steve) AI = 3
Encourage VT spending

[Comment: the current Proposal/voting system allows VT expenditure
to drop to almost nothing as a response to VT scarcity: it only takes
1 VT to pass a Proposal, provided enough Players declare Presence.
I propose to block that avenue of escape from scarcity by raising
the minimum expenditure required to pass a Proposal to 3 VTs. I also
clarify the status of uncancelled votes with respect to R955.]

Be it hereby resolved that Rule 955 (Votes Required to Adopt a
Proposal) be amended to read:

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

======================================================================
Proposal 3723 (Sherlock) AI = 1
Sherlock #1.3

Let a rule be created with the title "The Miscreant" and with the
following text:

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Miscreant".

      If any Player has more than ten Blots, the Player with the most 
      Blots earns the Title of Miscreant.  If no Player has the most
      number of Blots, there is no Miscrean t.  The Miscreant loses
      eir Title of Miscreant if eir number of Blots drops below ten,
      if another Player gains as many Blots as em, or if another Player
      gains more Blots than em. 
 
      A Player with the Title Miscreant counts as two Players towards
      the tally needed for Rebellion.  If a Rebellion occurs in which 
      the Miscreant was a Rebel, the Title of Miscreant is revoked
      from the Miscreant.

======================================================================
Proposal 3724 (Chuck) AI = 1
Repeal "Discourages Too Many Proposals"

Rule 1065 ("Discourages Too Many Proposals") is repealed.

[Comment: With the Proposal Queue, there's no benefit to
submitting lots of Proposals, and I think we can trust
people not to make unnecessary work for the Promotor.]

   3725 Steve          1 Tabula Rasa
   3726 Steve          1 No Quorum Tools

Syle Changes: 0

Both Proposed by the Wizard.

   3727 Kolja A.       1 B.N. for Kolja A.

Style Change: +2

R1542 says I can award Style Points for reasons having to do with the
effects of the Proposal. The effect of P3727, itself nothing to write
home about, is to grant Kolja a Degree for his very Stylish Thesis.

   3728 Repeal-O-Matic 1 Repeal Rule 1663 (Win by Proposals)

Style Change: 0

ROM Proposal - Style neutral.

   3729 Kolja A.       1 A Scoring nitpick

Style Change: 0

A nitpick, indeed.

U  3730 Swann          1 The Great Officer's Veto Scam Proposal

Style Change: 0

I didn't give this any Style the first time around, and I see
no reason to change my view.

   3731 Steve          1 Variable Batch Sizes

Style Change: 0

Proposed by the Wizard.

   3732 Kolja A.       1 No Trustees On Hold

Style Change: 0

Another nitpick. This is getting irritating.

   3733 Kolja A.       1 Vacated blots and scores

Style Change: 0

And still another tweak. Doesn't anyone make Stylish Proposals anymore?

   3734 Kolja A.       1 No PI for players on hold

Style Change: +1

Just barely merits it. It does handle a tricky little problem nicely.

I confirm that this allegation is correct, and that Time Agent has
indeed abandoned the game.  He was deregistered at the time of Steve's
message.

I can't penalise Time Agent for not delivering a Judgement as Justice,
as he is no longer a Player.  I don't believe I can penalise
Antimatter either because it seems to me that 1584 "Absolvement of
Duty for On Hold Players" (Power = 2) absolves him of the requirement
to deliver a Judgement.  There is no equivalent of R1568 "Judges on
Hold" for Justices. 

(Incidentally, shoudn't R1584 absolve On Hold Players from the
requirement to satisfy payment orders?)

Anyway, two more Justices have been appointed..

Appelate decisions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Crito:

I have nothing to add to the arguments that have already been posted
in the discussions related to this CFJ.  I find no flaws in the
argument presented by the original Judge, Michael, and therefore, I
vote to Sustain this Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Judgement: TRUE

Reasons and arguments:

The definition of Proposal is in Rule 1483, power = 1.

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

The issue of contention in the statement of the CFJ comes about
because a piece of text presumed to have been a Proposal was
distributed by Promotor Blob at time Wed, 4 Mar 1998 13:14:12 +1100
(EST), in an e-mail message with ID:
   <980304021412.8886@cse.unsw.edu.au>.

However, the text distributed as Proposal 3710 included the following:

      This Rule commemorates the Glorious and Dramatic Wins achieved
      by the Members of the Threat, Blob, elJefe, General Chaos and
      Steve, with the passage of Proposal <proposal numberat time
      <time>, which were made possible primarily by exploiting a
      loophole in the Rule 'Officer's Veto'.

I shall now argue that this paragraph was not present in any
collection of text delivered to the Promotor with the clear indication
that this text was intended to become a Proposal.

Who might have delivered such a text?  Swann certainly did not deliver
this text to Blob.  He did deliver a similar text, but it was
sufficiently different not to be legally the same.  (The only rules
allowing for different texts to be considered legally same are R754,
which talks only of differences of spelling, grammar and dialect, and
R1339 which talks of variation of white-space and capitalisation in
rule change specifications.)

Could Blob have delivered the text to himself in such a way as to
satisfy the conditions in R1483?  This is a more interesting question.
However, I do not believe that this could have happened for two
reasons:

i)  We have no evidence to suggest that Blob at any stage initiated
    the delivery of the text in question, except possibly when he
    distributed the text in the message referred to above.  We rule
    out this latter possibility, because as is clear from the
    reactions of the Players of Agora (who voted on the putative
    Proposal), there was no clear indication that this text was
    intended to become a Proposal.  Rather the distribution of this
    text (including its delivery to Blob via the Public Forum)
    convinced everyone that a real Proposal was before them and had
    been distributed.

ii) Even if Blob did manage to somehow deliver the text to himself
    prior to his ditribution of it to the Public Forum, his subsequent
    behaviour again suggests that there was no clear indication
    attached to the text that this was intended to become a Proposal.
    If there had been such an indication with the text, then he would
    not have distributed it under Swann's name, and would not have
    attributed it an Urgency that it did not have.

As the text distributed in the message referred to above is the only
possible instance of a Proposal being distributed with the name in
question, and as I have ruled out this possibility, I conclude that
the statement of the CFJ is TRUE.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Promotor Blob's attempt to distribute this Proposal included a typo
not present in Swann's Proposal submission.  This statement claims
that, therefore, the text in Blob's message was not a Proposal at all;
in particular, that Blob had not implicitly submitted that text as a
Proposal
