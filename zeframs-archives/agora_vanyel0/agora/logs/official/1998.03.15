THE SHORT LOGICAL RULESET



======================================================================
The Game of Agora
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1020/0 (Power=3)
Name is Agora

      The Official Name of this Nomic shall be Agora.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/0 (Power=3)
Obey the Rules

      All Players must always abide by all the Rules then in effect,
      in the form in which they are then in effect.  The Rules in the
      Initial Set are in effect at the beginning of the first game.
      The Initial Set consists of Rules 101-116 (Immutable) and
      201-219 (Mutable).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 116/0 (Power=3)
Permissibility of the Unprohibited

      Whatever is not prohibited or regulated by a Rule is permitted
      and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the Rules,
      which is permitted only when a Rule or set of Rules explicitly
      or implicitly permits it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1011/3 (Power=2)
Game Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed

      A "Nomic Property" is any property of any entity which that
      entity possesses solely by the virtue of the Rules defining that
      property.

      No Nomic Property shall be changed except in accordance with
      procedures specified by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1527/2 (Power=1)
Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one notification, report,
      or other communication in which the Rules place some legal
      significance, the communications in that message shall be taken
      to have been sent sequentially, separated by infinitesimal
      increments of time, in the order which they appear in the
      message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1600/1 (Power=1)
Standard Mathematics

      Except where the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have the
      definition usually given to it in standard mathematics.  In
      particular,  "number" shall mean  "real number."

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 754/3 (Power=1)
Spelling and Grammar Errors

      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning. In other words, the meaning
      or validity of such communication is not altered in any way by
      such discrepancies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 795/2 (Power=1)
Accurate Quoting Shall Not Be Penalized

      When a Player quotes a Rule, Proposal, Statement, Judgement, the
      words of another Player, or other references, that Player shall
      not be penalized in any way for the terminology or grammar used
      in those quotes.

      For the purpose of this Rule, a gain or loss of Kudos by any
      means shall not be construed as a punishment.

      This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which specifies
      terminology or grammar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1497/4 (Power=1)
Truth in Advertising

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of any message sent to the Public Forum or
      in response to a request for information which that Player is
      required to provide commits the Crime of Misrepresentation, a
      Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of a message to an Officer which that
      Officer is then required to act upon commits the Crime of
      Falsification, a Class C Crime.

      A Player who presents as correct information which e believes to
      be incorrect as part of evidence in a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement commits the Crime of Perjury, a Class B
      Crime.

      A Player shall never be convicted of more than one of the above
      Crimes for the same act.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1727/3 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by First Speaker
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

       "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
        precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
        may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
        invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
        published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
        convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic,
      known unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played
      on, until its Players, much later, gave it its official name of
      Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that prior to, but not more than seven
      days before, Agora's Birthday, the Ambassador shall announce
      Agora's upcoming Birthday to all Friendly nomics;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that, not less than seven days prior to
      Agora's Birthday, the Chancellor shall, on behalf of the Bank,
      submit delayed Transfer Orders to be executed at 00:04:30 GMT
      +1200 on Agora's Birthday to each Player for the amount of 3 VTs
      each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chancellor shall, on behalf of
      the Bank, submit Transfer Orders for one P-note each from the
      Bank to each Player who posts to the Public Forum during Agora's
      Birthday a message recognizing Agora's Birthday; these Transfer
      Orders to be executed as soon as possible after Agora's Birthday
      ends;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Notary may select up to three
      Contests, in existence on Agora's Birthday, which have as their
      purpose encouraging the celebration of Agora's Birthday; and
      which Contests, in the Notary's estimation, are worthy of
      recognition for this effort; and shall pay out to each such
      Contest 5 VTs, and to their Contestmasters 2 P-Notes each;

      BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Courts shall be closed on
      Agora's Birthday; that is, the Clerk of the Courts shall not
      publish any Calls For Judgement, Judgements, notices of Appeals,
      Decisions of Appeals Boards, or Opinions, on Agora's Birthday;
      nor shall any Player submit to the Clerk of the Courts a Call
      For Judgement, notice of ineligibility to Judge, Judgement,
      call for Appeal, or Appellate Decision, on Agora's Birthday; nor
      shall any Player Execute an Application to Submit an Opinion on
      Agora's Birthday; however, if any of the above do take place on
      Agora's Birthday, in violation of this Rule, this Rule does not
      deprive them of their usual effects.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1586/1 (Power=1)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      A "Nomic Entity" is any entity which has no discernible
      existence without the Rules, only existing by virtue of the
      Rules defining it to exist.  No two Nomic Entities (including
      Players) shall have the same name or nickname.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are repealed or
      amended such that they no longer define that entity, that entity
      ceases to exist, along with any properties it may have
      possessed.

      When the Rules defining a given Nomic Entity are amended such
      that they still define the Entity but in a different way or with
      different properties, that entity and its properties continue to
      exist to whatever extent is possible under the new definition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 478/9 (Power=1)
The Public Forum

      Whether a given medium is a Public Forum or not is a Nomic
      Property.  The Registrar is authorized to change whether a given
      medium is a Public Forum or not Without Objection.  When such
      a change is made, in order to be effective, the message
      annoucing the change must be sent to both a medium that was a
      Public Forum before the change, and a medium that is a Public
      Forum after the change.  (If a single medium is a Public Forum
      both before and after the change, a single message to that
      medium satisfies this requirement.)

      It is the responsibility of each Active Player to ensure that e
      is able to receive messages sent to every medium which the
      Registrar has designated as a Public Forum.  The temporary
      inability of a Player to receive a Public Forum does not deprive
      that medium of any legal significance as a Public Forum.

      Sending a message, by any medium or combination of media, to
      every Active Player, is equivalent to sending it to the Public
      Forum, provided that the message bears a clear indication that
      it is intended to be a message to the Public Forum, and it is
      verifiable that the message was in fact sent to every Active
      Player.

      Whenever the Rules calls upon some Player to "announce", "post",
      or "distribute" some communication or notification, this shall
      be accomplished by posting the communication or notification to
      the Public Forum, unless another rule specifies otherwise

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 459/1 (Power=1)
The Nomic Week

      The Nomic Week begins at midnight, GMT, each Monday. Any
      automatic change in the state of the Game which must occur
      weekly occurs at the beginning of the Nomic Week. Any
      automatic change which must occur monthly occurs at midnight,
      GMT, on the first of the month.  Any automatic change which must
      occur quarterly occurs at midnight, GMT, on the first day of
      each calendar quarter.

      This Rule defers to any Rule that defines another explicit
      schedule for events.  Any activity that must be performed at
      least weekly, monthly, or quarterly, must occur at least once in
      the given period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1274/1 (Power=3)
Definition of Indices

      Let there be a class of Entities known as "Indices" (singular:
      "Index").  An Index shall have a value, which is either a
      non-negative real number or the special value "Unanimity".

      An Index of Unanimity is greater than any other Index.  When
      comparing other Indices, the Index which is numerically greater
      is the greater Index.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1688/0 (Power=3)
Power

      There shall exist a property of entities known as Power.  The
      Power of an entity is an Index, as described elsewhere.

      An "instrument" is any entity with Power greater than zero.

      The Power of any given entity is zero until and unless it is set
      to another value in accordance with the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1023/9 (Power=2)
Definition of "As Soon As Possible"

      Whenever a Player is required to perform a certain action
      "as soon as possible", then:

      (i)  if the action is one that a Player is required to
           perform in the course of carrying out Official
           duties, then the Player is required to perform the
           action within a week, and no earlier than any other
           action which the performance of the duties of that
           Office already requires em to perform as soon as
           possible;

      otherwise,

      (ii) e is required to perform that action within a week,
           and no earlier than any other action e is already
           required to perform as soon as possible which is not an
           action performed in the course of carrying out Official
           duties.

      A Player who fails to observe these requirements commits the
      the Infraction of Tardiness, the penalty for which shall be the
      same as that for a Class D Crime. All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      Activity of a purely discussionary nature is excluded from the
      ordering requirement, and may be conducted at any time.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a Penalty.  It takes precedence over other Rules which
      define a later latest time for the performance of these actions.
      Other Rules may impose earlier latest times, and if so, this
      Rule defers to them.

      This Rule defers to Rules which describe the responsibilities of
      Players who are On Hold, and to any Rules which impose different
      requirements on the timing of Official Duties.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1079/2 (Power=1)
Definition of "Random"

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.

      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1769/0 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 7 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins
      within 24 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays
      and the time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless
      this would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 7 days in
      length, in which case the first Holiday is extended to 7 days
      and the second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a
      given time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or
      within the twenty-four-hour period immediately following that
      Holiday, then that action need not be done until twenty-four
      hours after that Holiday ends.  If some Rule bases the time of a
      future event upon the time of another event, or requires that a
      Player perform some action within some time of another event,
      and that event occurs during a Holiday, the time at which the
      Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose of
      determining the time of the future event or of the time by which
      the Player must perform the specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1787/0 (Power=1)
April Fool's Day

      A break from all the stress and strife
         and matters of much gravity,
      is what this Nomic sorely needs:
         a dithyramb to levity!

      In order that, just once a year,
         our hearts be light and gay,
      Let April Fool's Day, every year
         become a Holiday!

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1744/0 (Power=1)
Danger! Danger Will Robinson!

      October 16, 1997, shall be known as Lost In Space Day.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1750/0 (Power=1)
Read the Ruleset Week

      In each year, the first Nomic Week falling entirely in
      February shall be designated "Read the Ruleset Week".

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 114/1 (Power=3)
Rules Can Always Be Changed

      It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications to
      the ruleset by some combination of player actions.  Any change
      to the gamestate that would cause this condition to become false
      does not occur, any rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 920, Apr. 17 1997: Rule 114 should be interpreted such that a
change to the rules such that they instantaneously thereafter do not
permit modification of the rules is not prevented from occurring by
Rule 114 if it leaves the gamestate such that after some definite
finite or infinitesemal time interval the rules will again change such
that the gamestate then satisfies Rule 114's condition.
Relevant Rules: 114

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1692/4 (Power=1)
Power of Rules

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence Between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1513/1 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      It is legal for the Rules to grant the power to require Players
      to perform (or not perform) actions to Nomic Entities created in
      accordance with the Rules.  Such Entities shall have whatever
      power is granted to them by the Rules.  In the event that the
      requirements of such an Entity conflicts with the Rules, the
      Rules shall always take precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities which are
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity which was
      created first under the authority of that Rule takes precedence
      over the others.

      No Nomic Entity is permitted to require a Player to perform or
      not perform an action unless the information of which actions
      can be required of em by that Entity has been previously
      provided to that Player. Especially, no body of text is
      permitted to require Players to perform or not perform any
      actions unless said body of text has previously been made
      available to that Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The Players
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 869/6 (Power=1)
Registered Players

      A Player is any person who is registered as a Player.
      A person is Registered to play when e sends a message to the
      Public Forum requesting Registration; this Rule defers to Rules
      which would prevent such a Registration.

      If a Player has to be identified for whatever purpose, then the
      use of that Player's Agora nickname is preferred, but not
      obligatory: *any* unambiguous way of identification is allowed.

      When a Player registers, eir Location is the Welcoming Center.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1676/2 (Power=1)
Grace Period for New Players

      Whenever a person registers as a Player in Agora, and that
      person has not been registered as a Player in Agora at any time
      within the 12 months prior to this registration, e is subject to
      a Grace Period that begins at the time of eir registration and
      ends two months afterwards.

      A Player is only subject to the Grace Period resulting from eir
      own registration.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Grace Periods that
      are in progress.  For each such Grace Period this list shall
      include the Player subject to the Grace Period, the time at
      which it started, and the time at which it will end.  This list
      is known as the Pink Pages, and is part of the Registrar's
      Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1677/3 (Power=1)
Currency Awards for New Players

      Upon the start of a Player's Grace Period, the Registrar shall
      pay out to that Player an award of 5 Voting Tokens.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1432/1 (Power=2)
Player Uniqueness

      If a Person becomes a Player, then ceases to be a Player, then
      becomes a Player once again, the Person becomes the same Player
      as e was previously.  Further, no person may be registered as a
      Player more than once concurrently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 113/1 (Power=3)
Players may always opt out

      A Player may always deregister from the Game rather than
      continue to play or incur a Game penalty.  No penalty worse
      than deregistration, in the judgment of the Player to incur
      it, may be imposed.

CFJ 826, Nov. 15 1995: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that, even
if a Player considers a penalty to be worse than deregistration, e is
still subject to it unless e actually deregisters or is deregistered.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 853, Feb. 2 1996: Rule 113 should be interpreted such that it does
not allow a Player to deregister retroactively.
Relevant Rules: 113

CFJ 856, Feb. 20 1996: Rule 113/1 should be interpreted to mean simply
that a Player may always deregister from the Game rather than continue
to play.  The other language in the Rule is merely a gloss on that
basic content, illustrating some of its implications;it does not
change the essential meaning of the Rule.
Relevant Rules: 113

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 103/0 (Power=3)
The Speaker and Voters

      At any time, each Player shall be either a Voter or the Speaker;
      no Player may simultaneously be a Voter and a Speaker. At any
      time, there shall be exactly one Speaker. The term "Player" in
      the Rules shall specifically include both the Voters and the
      Speaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 104/0 (Power=3)
First Speaker

      The Speaker for the first game shall be Michael Norrish.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1016/10 (Power=2)
Putting Oneself on Hold

      At any time, each Player shall either be On Hold or Off Hold.
      This status shall not be changed except as specified in the
      Rules.

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e Moves to the Stasis
      Chamber.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e Moves from the Stasis
      Chamber.  E may not do so until at least 96 hours after e last
      went On Hold.

      "Active" and "Inactive" are unambiguous synonyms for "Off Hold"
      and "On Hold", respectively.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1584/0 (Power=2)
Absolvement of Duty for On Hold Players

      An On Hold Player is not permitted to Vote on Proposals, make
      Proposals, or hold Office, and cannot be required by the Rules
      to perform any duty or action, unless that Rule specifically
      states that it can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      This Rule takes precedence over every other Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1043/3 (Power=1)
Deregistration

      A Voter may deregister from Agora by sending a message to the
      Public Forum announcing eir deregistration. A Voter who
      deregisters in this fashion ceases to be a Player effective at
      the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em to
      reregister before the beginning of the next month are without
      effect; this Rule takes precedence over Rules which would cause
      em to be reregistered before the beginning of the next month.

      Other Rules may define other conditions under which Voters may
      be deregistered.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1042/9 (Power=1)
Deregistration due to Silence

      Each Player is either Noisy, Quiet or Silent. Whenever a Player
      posts to the Public Forum, or a new Player registers, that
      Player is Noisy.

      Any Player can cause another Active Noisy Player to become
      Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly identifying
      that Player, in the Public Forum.  If a Player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a Player has
      been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes Silent.

      Any Player can cause a Silent Player to be deregistered by
      stating in the Public Forum that the Silent Player has
      Abandoned the game. If the Speaker is Silent, and it is alleged
      in the Public Forum that e has Abandoned the Game, e commits
      the Class A Crime of Speaker Abandonment. E ceases to be
      Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker. E is then
      deregistered. In either case, the Registrar shall, as soon as
      possible after an allegation in the Public Forum that a Player
      has Abandoned the game, confirm or deny in the Public Forum
      that the deregistration has actually occurred.

      The Registrar shall include in eir Report the most recent
      date on which each Player changed from being Noisy, Quiet or
      Silent to any of the others.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1789/0 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who ey feel have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall post this document to the Public Forum along
      with a Writ of Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione,
      commanding the Player to be deregistered and instructing the
      Registrar to note the method of deregistration for that Player
      in subsequent Registrar Reports, as long as the Player remains
      deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1755/0 (Power=1)
No Non-Player Responsiblilities

      When a player becomes deregistered, e ceases to be a candidate,
      officer, judge, or executor in probate, or in general to occupy
      any role or position to which a Rule assigns any duties or
      powers.  Noone who is not registered may occupy such a role or
      position.  This rule takes precedence over rules which would
      prevent em from ceasing to occupy such a role or position.

      The foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the holding of Patent
      Titles, or any position which a Rule specifically says may be
      held by a non-Player, nor shall it act to prevent a nonPlayer
      from registering, calling CFJs, or doing things that nonPlayers
      generally are able to do.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Officers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/6 (Power=1)
Defaults for Officers

      An Office is a position of authority or responsibility
      established by the Rules and held by a Player, who is called an
      Officer.

      At any time, an Office is held by exactly one Player; if no
      other Rule directly or indirectly specifies which Player holds
      an Office, it shall be held by the Speaker.

      A position of responsibility or authority is only an Office if
      the Rules specifically designate it as such.  An Office only
      exists as long as there is a Rule in force which specifies that
      it exists.  If the Rule or Rules which mandated the existence of
      an Office are changed such that they no longer do so, that
      Office ceases to exist.

      A given Office has whatever duties, responsibilities, and
      privileges that the Rules assign to it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1686/0 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      For each Office, the Rules may designate a set of information to
      be the corresponding Officer's Report.  All such Reports are
      Official Reports.  The only information that is part of an
      Official Report is that which the Rules specifically state is
      part of that Official Report.

      The holder of an Office for which there is an Official Report
      shall maintain all information in the Report, and shall post it
      to the Public Forum at least once every Nomic Week.  Failure to
      post the Official Report is the Infraction of Failure to Report,
      the penalty for which is the same as the penalty for a Class D
      Crime.  The Registrar and the Speaker are authorised to detect
      and report commissions of this Infraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1064/7 (Power=1)
Freedom of Information Act

      If a Player is mandated by the Rules to maintain a set of
      records, these records must be available for public perusal,
      unless such records are designated by the Rules as private.  A
      Player who maintains such records must provide a copy of these
      Records to any other Player upon request within one week.  If e
      fails to so provide a copy of the requested records within one
      week, e commits Unlawful Nondisclosure, a Class D Crime, unless
      the Records are unavailable for reasons beyond eir control and e
      reports this fact, with explanation, within one week.

      For the purpose of this Rule, all records pertaining to Votes
      currently in progress, excluding the text of the Proposals under
      consideration, are designated as private until the end of the
      Voting Period.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1431/10 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a message posted to the Public Forum to the
      effect that a specific post to the Public Forum misrepresents
      the actual Game State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error consists in posting to the Public
      Forum either a denial of the Claim or an admission of the
      Claim. If the Claim is admitted, then the Player making the
      admission is required to post a corrected version of the
      relevant portion of the message which was in error, before one
      week passes from the time the Claim of Error was made. A Player
      who admits a Claim but does not publish a correction is deemed
      not to have Responded to that Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the alloted time
      commits the Infraction of Delayed COE Response, carrying a
      penalty of 1 Blot, to be reported by the Player who posted the
      Claim. A Player who incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim
      commits the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime,
      unless e then admits the Claim within 72 hours after the
      incorrect denial.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1550/2 (Power=1)
Ratification

      Any Official Document (as specified in other Rules) may be
      ratified by the operation of an adopted Proposal (but no other
      sort of instrument).  The instrument must specify an Official
      Document (as specified in other Rules) which is subject to
      ratification.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1551/4 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time of the Document's
      publication in the Public Forum.  In other words, the State of
      the Game, upon such ratification, becomes that specified within
      the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the time
      of its publication and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published in the
      Public Forum, even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or
      illegal move, or an Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over
      any Rule that would allow such retroactive alterations or
      corrections to the Game State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified..

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1552/1 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public
              Forum.  (A requirement that it be sent to all Players
              fulfills this criteria.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1555/2 (Power=1)
Retirement and Removal from Offices

      When an Officer is retired from an Office, e ceases to hold it
      in the normal fashion, but continues to hold the Office
      temporarily.  When an Officer is removed from Office, the
      Speaker shall become the temporary holder of that Office,
      unless another Rule specifies a different Player who is to
      become the temporary holder of that Office.

      If an Officer goes On Hold, deregisters, or is deregistered, e
      shall immediately be removed from every Office e holds.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1556/1 (Power=1)
Terms of Service for Offices

      Unless otherwise specified, the Term of Service for an Office
      shall expire on the first day of the fourth month following the
      month in which the Officer in question was elected to that
      Office.  At the exhaustion of an Office's Term of Service, the
      Officer holding that Office shall be retired from that Office.

      This Rule defers to Rules which specify a different Term of
      Service for specific Offices.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1758/1 (Power=1)
Holding an Office in Perpetuity

      If a certain Office is held in the normal fashion by a Player,
      then the Registrar may declare Without Objection that that
      Player holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office. If a
      Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office to
      another Player, then, if e resumes holding the Office in the
      normal fashion at the end of the Period of Delegation, e also
      resumes holding the Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 880/4 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without
      consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.  An Officer
      who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed to have
      appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1645/3 (Power=1)
Temporary Delegation of Office

      A Player who holds an Office in the normal fashion is permitted
      to appoint another Player to perform the duties of that Office,
      for a Period not exceeding two weeks. This is called Delegation;
      the Player doing the appointing is herein referred to as the
      Delegating Player and the Player so appointed is herein referred
      to as the Delegated Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (i)   the Delegating Player has posted to the Public Forum a
            Notice of Delegation, naming the Office being Delegated
            and the Delegated Player;

      (ii)  the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold
            the Office at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (iii) the Delegated Player has posted, within the week
            immediately preceding or immediately following the
            posting of the Notice of Delegation, and to the Public
            Forum, a Notice of Consent to Delegation for that Office;

      (iv)  the Delegating Player still holds the Office in the
            normal fashion at the commencement of the Period of
            Delegation;

      (v)   the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
            concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes two weeks after the Period of Delegation commences, or
      at the end of the Term of Service for the Delegated Office, or
      at the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player,
      whichever is earliest.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases
      to hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office temporarily, and earns the Salary for that Office as
      described in other Rules.  At the end of the Period of
      Delegation, the Delegated Player ceases to hold the Delegated
      Office, and the Delegating Player resumes holding the Office in
      the normal fashion, unless the Term of Service for that Office
      has expired, or a Revolt occurred during the Period of
      Delegation. If the Term of Service expired, the Delegated Player
      continues to hold the Office temporarily, although the Office
      ceases to be a delegated Office. If a Revolt occurred during the
      Period of Delegation, and at the end of the Period of Delegation
      no other Player is holding the Office in the normal fashion, the
      Delegating Player resumes holding the Office, but temporarily,

      This Rule defers to all other Rules which do not contain this
      sentence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 790/6 (Power=1)
Filling Vacant Offices

      An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

      As soon as possible after it occurs that there is an undelegated
      Office which is being held temporarily, and for which no
      Election is already being conducted, the Registrar shall
      initiate an Election to fill that Office, as described
      elsewhere.  However, if the Office in question is that of the
      Registrar, the Speaker shall instead initiate the Election.  The
      winner of that Election shall then hold that Office until e
      resigns or is retired or removed from that Office.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1486/3 (Power=1)
Procedure to Impeach An Officer

      An Officer is Impeached when a Referendum calling for the
      Impeachment of the Officer passes. Any Active Player is
      permitted to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting
      such to the Public Forum.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the Player holding
      this Office by name. If upon passage of the Referendum the named
      Player is holding the named Office, then that Player is
      immediately removed from that Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voting Entities do not include the
      Officer under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio is
      2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1644/1 (Power=1)
Dereliction of Duty

      A Player who:

      (i)   holds an Office in the normal fashion whose duties include
            the weekly production of an Official Report, and
      (ii)  fails in 3 consecutive weeks to produce the weekly Report
            for that Office

      commits the Infraction of Dereliction of Duty. The penalty for
      the commission of this Infraction is the same as that for a
      Class B Crime, in addition to which the Player is removed from
      the Office in the performance of whose duties e has been
      Derelict.

      The Registrar is the Officer authorized to detect and report
      the commission of Infractions of Dereliction of Duty by Officers
      other than the Registrar. The Clerk of the Courts is the Officer
      authorized to detect and report the commission of the Infraction
      of Dereliction of Duty by the Registrar.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1665/1 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class C
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1585/1 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs and in the
      same order in which the prior holder of that Office had been
      required to fulfill them.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1553/1 (Power=1)
Officer Transition

      Whenever a Player ceases to hold an Office, that Player shall
      make a reasonable effort to ensure that all materials necessary
      for the conduct of that Office, including any records the holder
      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to
      the next Player to hold that Office.  A Player who fails to do
      so violates this Rule, and commits the Crime of Improper Officer
      Transition, a Class C Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1728/2 (Power=1)
Actions Without Objection

      Certain changes to Nomic Properties may be made Without
      Objection.  Only those changes explicitly allowed by
      other Rules may be so made, and in order for such a
      change to take effect, the Rule allowing the change must
      explicitly state which Player or Players are authorized to
      make the change.

      In order to make a change Without Objection, a Player
      authorized to make a given change Without Objection must first
      post to the Public Forum eir intent to make such a change,
      unambiguously describing the change to be made.  The change then
      takes place when a Player authorized to make that change Without
      Objection (who need not be the same player who posted eir
      intent to make the change) posts to the Public Forum that that
      change is made, and the following conditions are fulfilled:
      * The post announcing the change is made no fewer than four
        days after, nor more than fourteen days after, the post
        annoucing the intent to make the change.
      * Between the two posts, no Player has posted to the Public
        Forum eir objection to the change.

      This Rule defers to Rules which place further restrictions
      on the effectiveness of changes made Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1664/4 (Power=1)
Rebellion

      Any Player is either Abiding or Rebellious. At the time this
      Rule is created, all Players are Abiding. A new Player is always
      Abiding.  A Player whose Location is the Beer Hall can switch
      from Abiding to Rebellious or from Rebellious to Abiding by
      sending a message to the Public Forum saying e does change so.
      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Players that are
      Rebellious, and shall publish this list weekly.

      If at any time at least 1/3 of all Players are Rebellious, and
      at least one month has passed since the last Revolt, a Revolt
      occurs.  The Registrar must post the fact that a Revolt
      has occured to the Public Forum as soon as possible. If a revolt
      occurs, then:
      - a Speaker Transition occurs.
      - All Players that hold one or more Offices are retired from all
        such Offices.
      - All Rebellious Players become Abiding again

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1643/1 (Power=1)
Statements of Policy

      A document is a Statement of Policy if and only if it meets
      the following requirements :
      * it is posted to the Public Forum
      * it claims, in these exact terms, to be a "Statement of Policy"
      * it specifies, by name, an Office which it pertains to
      * that Office is held by its author.

      A Statement of Policy, when issued, becomes an SLC, the
      Jurisdiction of which irrevocably consists of the Player holding
      the Office named therein. That Player shall also be its
      Maintainer.

      An Officer shall be permitted to change eir own Statement of
      Policy by issuing a new version to the Public Forum. Further,
      any Statement of Policy ceases to exist whenever the Office it
      pertains to ceases to be held by the Player it constrains.

      Any violation of a SOP constitutes a Crime of Breach of Policy,
      a Class 2 Crime.

Rule 1007/13 (Power=1)
Salaries of Officers

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay out
      to each Officer the designated Salary for each Office that
      Officer has held without interruption for the entire five days
      preceding.

      There shall be a Basic Officer Salary, which is equal to 1 VT.
      Salaries are permitted to be expressed in terms of the
      Basic Salary.  Unless otherwise specified, the Salary for an
      Office shall be equal to the Basic Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1788/0 (Power=1)
VT unemployment benefits

     At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Registrar shall pay
     out to every player who does not receive any Officer's Salary
     for the previous week an unemployment benefit of half a Basic
     Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Making Proposals
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1483/3 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A Proposal is created whenever a Proposing Entity delivers some
      collection of text to the Promotor with the clear indication
      that that text is intended to become a Proposal.  The collection
      of text thus delivered is a new Proposal, and the Proposing
      Entity which delivered it its Proposer. A collection of text is
      said to be Proposed when it becomes a Proposal.

      The delivery of the text of an existing Proposal which was
      Proposed less than three weeks previously does not cause that
      text to become another Proposal, unless there is a clear
      indication that that text is intended to become a duplicate of a
      prior Proposal.  In this case, the Proposing Entity must
      specifically acknowledge that the intended new Proposal is a
      duplicate of an existing Proposal.

      Further, the Promotor's distribution of previously undistributed
      Proposals never causes the Proposing of new Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 115/0 (Power=3)
Self-Referential Rules Allowed

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply
      Rule Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even
      Rule Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 107/0 (Power=3)
Rule Changes Must Be Written Down

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes

      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 594/3 (Power=1)
Proposals and Rule Changes

      When a Proposal is adopted, its Power becomes equal to its
      Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of the
      Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by the
      Rules.  Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable
      are ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision,
      each provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

      For the purpose of the Rules, the application of an adopted
      Proposal is a legal procedure for changing Nomic Properties.

      The Adoption Index of a Proposal is the maximum of 1, the value
      requested by its Proposer (if any), and the value required for
      that Proposal by the Rules (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 404/2 (Power=2)
Legality of Proposals

      No Rule shall have any effect which seeks to make the legality
      of making a Proposal conditional upon its content.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1623/10 (Power=1)
Disinterested Proposals

      A Proposal is Disinterested if the text of the message wherein
      it is submitted explicitly states that it is a Disinterested
      Proposal. If a Proposal is not Disinterested, it is Interested.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1723/1 (Power=1)
Sanity

      A Proposal is Sane if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is a Sane Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 2 P-Notes to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      Players may cast no more than one vote on a Sane Proposal.
      Non-Player Voting Entities may not vote on Sane Proposals.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would allow
      non-Player Voting Entities to vote on Sane Proposals, or which
      would allow Players to cast more than one vote on a Sane
      Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1724/1 (Power=1)
Urgent Proposals

      A Proposal is Urgent if all the following conditions are met:

         i) the text of the message wherein it is submitted
            explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal,

        ii) The Proposal is Interested,

       iii) The Proposer has paid 1 P-Note to the Bank, expressly
            for this purpose (and not for any other). In order for
            this payment to have effect, it must be made before
            the Proposal is distributed.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would specify
      the Voting Period for Urgent Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1605/1 (Power=1)
Proposing Entities

      Let there exist a type of entity called a Proposing Entity.
      Only Proposing Entities have the right to make Proposals,

      Each Player is a Proposing Entity.  Other entities are Proposing
      Entities only if defined as such by the Rules.

      Any other Rule notwithstanding, in order to make a Proposal, a
      Proposing Entity must have an Executor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1607/3 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      There shall exist the Office of the Promotor.  The Promotor
      shall receive a weekly salary equal to 1.5 times the Basic
      Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1036/8 (Power=1)
The Proposal Queue

      As soon as possible after the Promotor receives a new Proposal,
      e shall place this Proposal in the Proposal Queue.

      The Proposal Queue is a list of Proposals, sorted in order of
      descending Priority. Proposals of the same priority are listed
      in the order they were proposed.

      A Proposal's Priority is an integer value. All Proposals
      initially have a Priority of zero.

      The Promotor shall publish the Proposal Queue weekly. This
      publication shall include the number, title, priority, and time
      of proposal, for each proposal in the Queue. If a Proposal's
      Priority has changed since the Queue was last published, then
      this change shall also be published. The actual text of the
      Proposals in the Queue need not be published.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 109/3 (Power=2)
Proposal Numbers

      At the time e distributes it, the Promotor shall give each
      Proposal a Number for reference.  The Number of a Proposal shall
      be the least integer greater than all other Numbers previously
      assigned to a Proposal (including numbers assigned to Proposals
      later determined to have been incorrectly submitted), or 301,
      whichever is greater.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1770/0 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      Each week, the Promotor shall distribute a batch of Proposals.
      These are the only Proposals e is allowed to distribute that
      week.

      If there are five or fewer Proposals in the Proposal Queue
      having a Priority greater than zero, then the batch shall
      consist of all such Proposals.

      If there are more than five such proposals, then the batch
      shall consist of the first five such Proposals, in the order
      given by the Queue.

      Once a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
      Queue.

      Promotor shall distribute each proposal in the batch to the
      Public Forum, accompanied by its Number and the identity of
      its Proposing Entity.

      The failure of the Promotor to distribute any of the above
      accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
      distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is only considered to be legally distributed if it
      is explicitly marked as such. The Promotor is permitted to
      publish the text of undistributed Proposals without necessarily
      distributing them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1771/0 (Power=1)
Increasing Priority

      An Entity may increase the Priority of a proposal by notifying
      the Promotor that e does so, and paying a number of P-Notes to
      the Bank. For each P-Note e pays to the Bank, the Priority of
      the Proposal is increased by one, provided that this transfer
      is not executed for any other purpose.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1772/0 (Power=1)
Promotor's Privilege

      At most once a week, the Promotor may increase the Priority of
      a single Proposal in the Proposal Queue by one, so long as
      e is not the Proposer of the Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1773/0 (Power=1)
Decreasing Priority

      Every month, as soon as possible after the beginning of the
      month, the Promotor shall decrement by one the priority of all
      Proposals in the Proposal Queue which were proposed over a
      month previously.

      If the Priority of any Proposal falls below zero, then it
      shall be set to zero.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1774/0 (Power=1)
Discarding Proposals from the Queue

      If, at any time, there is a Proposal in the Proposal Queue
      which has zero Priority and has been in the Queue for more
      than a month, then the Promotor may, at eir discretion, remove
      this Proposal from the Queue, and discard it.

      Also, the Proposer of a Proposal in the Queue may remove that
      Proposal from the Queue, by notifying the Promotor that e
      does so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1753/3 (Power=1)
Repeal-O-Matic

      This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be
      referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic
      Rule is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

      The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals
      every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as
      follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at
      random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of
      these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and
      no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
      Rule's Proposals.

      The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible
      after the beginning of the Nomic Week.

      For each Rule picked by the Promotor, e shall send a message
      to the Public Forum, acting as the Repeal-O-Matic's Executor,
      submitting a Proposal that consists of the following quoted
      text, with substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number] ([Title])
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

      Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number
      of the Rule picked by the Promotor, [Power] is replaced by the
      Power of that same Rule, and [Title] is replaced by the Title
      of that same Rule. At eir discretion, the promotor may also
      append the text of that same rule to the proposal, marked as
      an informational attachment.

      If a rule picked by the promotor explicitly refers to other
      rules or to concepts or entities that also appear in other
      rules, the promotor is authorized, but not obliged, to add
      provisions to the Proposal that leave the ruleset in a more
      consistent and functional state after the repeal of the rule
      picked by the promotor.

      For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be
      deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal
      concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
      selection of that Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1349/0 (Power=2)
Rule Numbering

      The Rulekeepor shall give each newly-enacted Rule a Number for
      reference when it is created.  The Number of a Rule shall be the
      least integer greater than all other Numbers previously given to
      a Rule (including numbers assigned to Rules later determined to
      have been incorrectly enacted), or 301, whichever is greater.

      Once a Rule has been given a Rule Number, it shall not be
      changed except as specified in the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1003/2 (Power=2)
No Coercive Proposals

      Proposals whose obvious and direct intent is to coerce a Player
      into voting against eir conscience shall not take effect even if
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1065/12 (Power=1)
Discourages Too Many Proposals

      The submission of a Proposal by a Proposing Entity that has
      submitted more than five Proposals within the immediately
      preceding Week is the Infraction of Excess Proposing, the
      penalty for which is 0.5 VT.  This Infraction shall be detected
      and reported by the Promotor.

Rule 1449/6 (Power=1)
The Assessor

      There shall exist the Office of Assessor.  The Assessor

      Officer Salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/0 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      All Proposals made in the proper way shall be voted upon.  A
      Proposal shall be adopted if and only if it receives the
      required number of votes and if Quorum is achieved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 693/3 (Power=1)
Prescribed Voting Period

      The prescribed Voting Period for a Proposal is ten days,
      beginning at the time the Proposal is distributed to all
      Players.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1726/0 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is Executed by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its Execution, it takes effect when Executed.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 206/10 (Power=2)
Voting Entities and Votes

      A Voting Entity is an Entity which is generally authorized by
      the Rules to cast a vote or votes on a Proposal, although other
      Rules may withdraw this authorization from a Voting Entity in
      specific circumstances without that Entity thereby ceasing to
      be a Voting Entity. No Entity is permitted to vote on a
      Proposal unless it is a Voting Entity, and only those Entities
      designated by the Rules to be Voting Entities are Voting
      Entities. Players and Groups are Voting Entities.

      Each Voting Entity has two votes on a Proposal, unless another
      Rule says otherwise. However, no such Entity shall have more
      than five votes on any Proposal, regardless of what any other
      Rule may say to the contrary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1765/0 (Power=1)
Attributing Additional Votes

      For each vote beyond the first two an entity casts on a
      particular Proposal, that entity must provide to the Assessor
      the Rule Numbers of the Rules that permit the casting of that
      additional vote.  If these Rule Numbers are not provided to the
      Assessor before the end of the voting period for that Proposal,
      the Assessor has the option to not count more than two votes on
      that Proposal from that entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 452/12 (Power=1)
Prohibit Electioneering by Vote Collectors

      For the purposes of this Rule, a Vote Collector is defined as
      any Player to whom the Rules give the responsibility of
      tallying votes on a Proposal, Referendum or Election. Hence
      this Rule explicitly regulates the behaviour of the Assessor
      with respect to Proposals, and the behaviour of any Player
      (generally the Registrar or the Speaker) who acts as Vote
      Collector in an Election or Referendum.

      During the prescribed Voting Period of a Proposal, Election or
      Referendum, anyone who has served as Vote Collector for that
      Proposal, Election, or Referendum is prohibited from making use
      of any knowledge of the current status of the vote on that
      Proposal, Election or Referendum which e would not have had e
      not served as Vote Collector, in any attempt to influence the
      result of the vote on the Proposal, Election or Referendum.
      Doing so is the Crime of Electioneering, a Class C Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prevent a player from transferring
      voting records to the current Vote Collector. Doing so is not a
      Crime.

      This Rule shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from
      posting, at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those
      Voting Entities which have already voted or declared that they
      are Present on a given Proposal, Election or Referendum. If a
      vote or declaration of Presence has already appeared in the
      Public Forum prior to the publication of such a list, then the
      Vote Collector is permitted to indicate how the Voting Entity
      has voted, or whether it has declared itself Present. Otherwise,
      the Vote Collector is prohibited from specifically indicating
      whether the Voting Entity has voted, or declared Presence. The
      publication of a list as described in this Rule is not a Crime,
      unless specified as such by another Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1625/2 (Power=1)
Secrecy of Votes

      A Player who discloses the Vote or Votes cast by a Voting Entity
      before the end of the Voting Period of a Proposal commits the
      Crime of Breach of Voting Secrecy, a Class C Crime, unless one
      or more of the following applies:

        a) that Player did not at any time during the Voting Period of
           that Proposal, hold the Office of Assessor;
        b) that Player is the Executor of the Voting Entity whose
           Vote(s) were disclosed;
        c) the disclosure is made only to the Voting Entity (or its
           Executor) whose Vote(s) were disclosed; or
        d) the disclosure is required by another Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 683/5 (Power=1)
Legal Votes

      A Vote upon a Proposal must be one of FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN
      (or an obvious synonym of one of these).  Something which is not
      one of these is not a Vote upon a Proposal.

      A Vote cast upon a Proposal by a Voting Entity which has an
      Executor is cast at the time its Executor either posts it to the
      Public Forum or otherwise sends it to the Assessor.  A Vote is
      legally cast if it is cast during the Voting Period of that
      Proposal, and if that Voting Entity is entitled to cast a Vote
      on that particular Proposal.

      A Vote cast by a Voting Entity which does not have an Executor
      is cast at a time and in a manner specified in other Rules.

      This Rule in no way authorizes any Entity to cast Votes upon
      Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1715/2 (Power=1)
Announcing One's Presence

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

      Players who declare themselves PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum during the Voting Period of that Proposal,
      Election or Referendum are, solely for the purpose of
      determining Quorum, considered to have voted, but a Player who
      both declares emself PRESENT and also Votes on the Proposal,
      Election or Referendum is counted only once toward Quorum.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules which determine
      Quorum or whether a Proposal, Election or Referendum has met
      Quorum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1764/0 (Power=1)
Public Voting

      Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
      any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voting Entities
      on Proposals, Elections or Referenda, may only be achieved by
      sending a message to the Public Forum.

      However, this Rule shall have no effect on the voting for a
      Proposal if it would prevent all legal voting on that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1729/0 (Power=1)
Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should it occur (due to greed or sin)
      that no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1717/1 (Power=1)
The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding two months.

      At any time during a Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker may
      make it a Senate Proposal, by stating so in the Public Forum.
      If that does not happen, the Proposal is not a Senate Proposal.

      Entities other than Senators cannot Vote on Senate Proposals.
      If an Entity other than a Senator has already voted on a
      Proposal by the time it becomes a Senate Proposal, eir votes
      on that Proposal are cancelled.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1660/0 (Power=1)
The Speaker's Vote

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to, once in any
      given Nomic Week, choose one specific Proposal (that e is
      otherwise eligible to vote for) and cast one vote in addition to
      any others e is permitted to cast on that Proposal.

      This Rule does not increase the maximum allowable votes that can
      be cast by a Voting Entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1766/0 (Power=1)
The Officer's Vote

      If a particular Proposal amends the duties or description of a
      particular Office, and a Player holds that Office in normal
      fashion, and that Player is not the same Player who Proposed the
      Proposal, then that Player may cast two additional votes on that
      Proposal beyond what e is otherwise entitled to cast.  This
      shall not increase the maximum number of votes that are
      permitted to be cast by that Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
The End of the Voting Period
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 879/6 (Power=1)
Quorum

      Quorum for a Proposal is achieved if a vote is cast on that
      Proposal by one-third of Active Players, or one-fifth of all
      Players, whichever is greater.

      Quorum for a Proposal is calculated using the number of
      Registered Players, and their Hold statuses (On or Off), at the
      beginning of the prescribed Voting Period for that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1760/0 (Power=1)
Quorum Buyback

      Any Player other than the Assessor is permitted to buyback
      Quorum on a particular Proposal.  A Player is only permitted to
      do this once for any single Proposal. A Player does this by
      informing the Assessor that e wishes to buyback Quorum on a
      specified Proposal. That Player can rescind eir buyback before
      the end of the voting period by sending a message stating so to
      the Assessor.

      The effect of a Player's buyback on Quorum (if it is not
      rescinded) is to reduce the Quorum on the specified Proposal by
      one.  If multiple Players buyback Quorum on a single Proposal,
      the effect is cumulative.

      At the end of the voting period for that Proposal, the Assessor
      shall adjust the Quorum for that Proposal by subtracting one for
      each buyback that was not rescinded.  The Assessor shall then
      bill each Player whose buyback was not rescinded one P-Note.

      The Assessor is required to maintain the same secrecy about a
      Player's buyback as e is a Player's Vote.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1761/0 (Power=1)
Quorum Without Objection

      The Speaker has the power to, Without Objection, designate any
      Proposal whose voting period is underway to have achieved
      Quorum.  That Proposal shall then have its Quorum adjusted to
      equal zero.

      This Rule takes precedence over the Rules defining Quorum for
      Proposals.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/2 (Power=1)
End of the Voting Period

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period on a
      given Proposal, the Assessor shall publish all the Votes cast
      upon that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 955/3 (Power=3)
Votes Required to Adopt a Proposal

      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the Votes which
      have been legally cast shall be counted by the Assessor.  The
      Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting Index, as follows: the
      Proposal received no Votes opposed, and at least one Vote in
      favor, the Voting Index shall be Unanimity; if there are no
      Votes in favor, the Voting Index shall be zero; in all other
      cases, the Voting Index shall be the number of Votes in favor
      divided by the number of Votes opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      given Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, then that Proposal
      passes.  Otherwise, it fails.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1322/3 (Power=3)
Effectiveness of Rule Changes

      A given Rule Change shall not take effect unless the Power of
      the instrument which specified it is at least as great as the
      greater of the current Power of the Rule to be Changed (if any)
      and the Power the Rule would have after the Change (if any).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 108/1 (Power=3)
When May Rule Changes Take Effect?

      A given form of a Rule may not have effects earlier than
      the moment it came to have that form. The form of a Rule
      consists of its text and other substantive properties.

      No Rule Change may have retroactive application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 376/3 (Power=1)
When Proposals Take Effect

      A Proposal which is Adopted takes effect at the time date-
      stamped on the first message sent by the Assessor to reach
      the Public Forum announcing the results of the voting on that
      Proposal.

      If the message sent by the Assessor announcing the results of
      the voting on a Proposal also contains the results of voting
      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in order by increasing Proposal Number.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1690/0 (Power=1)
Power of New Rules

      The Power of a new Rule shall be as specified by the instrument
      which causes the creation of that Rule; if no such specification
      exists, the Power of the new Rule shall be 1.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1561/1 (Power=2)
Illegality of Bonus Clauses

      Any Proposal which offers a bribe to a Player or Players to
      vote either FOR or AGAINST a Proposal (either itself or another
      Proposal) shall be completely without effect, even if it is
      adopted, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1069/1 (Power=1)
Amendment Numbers

      A Rule's Amendment Number is equal to the number of times a
      Rule having that Rule Number has been amended. The default
      Amendment Number is zero; this is the value of a Rule's
      Amendment Number when the Rule is Created, and it is the value
      of the Amendment Number of every Rule unless it is specified by
      the Rules to be otherwise.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to
      accurately update Amendment Numbers.

      Amendment Numbers may be used for Official purposes and in
      Official documents to distinguish between old versions of a
      Rule and the Rule's current text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 833/10 (Power=1)
Awards & Penalties for Proposals

      As soon as possible after the beginning of the Nomic Week,
      the Assessor shall pay out two Voting Tokens to each Player
      who submitted an Interested Proposal which was adopted during
      the previous Week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 947/11 (Power=1)
Bonus for Repeal

      If a Proposal is adopted which, as part of all of its effect,
      repeals one or more Rules, and, immediately prior to the
      adoption of this Proposal there were more than 100 Rules, the
      Rulekeepor shall pay out 3 P-Notes to the Proposer of that
      Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1786/0 (Power=1)
Proposal Passed By the Narrowest of Margins

      A Proposal is considered to have passed by the narrowest of
      margins when all of the following conditions are true:

      1) The Proposal has met the requirements established by other
         Rules to be considered passed.
      2) If there had been 1 (one) less FOR vote (out of the total
         number of FOR votes in the final tally) on this proposal,
         it would not have passed or not met Quorum -- or both.
      3) There must have been at least 1 (one) AGAINST vote in the
         final tally.

      As soon as possible after a Proposal has been determined to
      have passed by the narrowest of margins, the Assessor shall pay
      out to that Proposal's Proposer an award of 3 (three) Voting
      Tokens in addition to any other award that Player might also
      receive for the passing of that Proposal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1678/3 (Power=1)
Encourage Proposals by New Players

      If an Interested Proposal passes, and that Proposal was
      submitted by a Player within that Player's Grace Period, then
      the Assessor shall pay out to that Player an award of 3 Voting
      Tokens, over and above any other award that Player might also
      receive for that Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence over
      Rules that would prevent this award.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1583/1 (Power=1)
Proposal Penalties Halved for New Players

      All penalties that are a direct result of voting on Proposals
      are halved if the penalties are being applied to a Player during
      that Player's Grace Period.

      This Rule take precedence over all other Rules pertaining to
      penalties that are a direct result of voting.

======================================================================
Referenda and Elections
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1434/3 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used. Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for collecting and tallying the Votes and announcing the result.
      This Entity is the Speaker if not otherwise specified.

      * Voting Entities: Every Player not on Hold may Vote on a
      Referendum.  On Hold status is measured at the time a Player
      sends eir Vote.

      * Voting: A Voting Entity Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
      Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum e
      is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN. Words which
      are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength. No Voting Entity
      may Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: A Vote, once sent to the Vote Collector, cannot be
      changed.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time the
      first correct and legal announcement that a Referendum is
      begun, as defined in other Rules, is sent to the Public
      Forum, together with the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week. All
      Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
      Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector may not give away any information about the Votes
      while the Voting is underway.

      This shall in no way prohibit the Vote Collector from posting,
      at any time and to the Public Forum, a list of those Players who
      have already Voted.

      * Secrecy After Voting: Unless otherwise specified, the Vote
      Collector shall post to the Public Forum, after the Voting
      Period is over, the number of Votes of each kind as well as the
      name and Vote of each Entity which cast a Vote.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio, the ratio of FOR Votes on
      a Referendum relative to the AGAINST VOTES, must be greater than
      1 for the Referendum to pass. If it is not, the Referendum
      fails.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Referendum automatically fails.

      * Nonperformance by Vote Collector: The Vote Collector must
      perform eir required duties, but if the result of a Referendum
      is not announced within one Week following the end of the Voting
      Period, it automatically fails.

      * Effectiveness: the full effects of a Referendum, as defined
      in Rules which make use of the Referendum procedure, come
      into force as of the moment the results are announced to the
      Public Forum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1445/8 (Power=1)
Defaults for Elections

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used. Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is the Entity responsible
      for taking nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and
      announcing the result. Unless otherwise specified, this Entity
      is the Player who is Speaker at the time the Referendum starts.
      If another Player is specified, this Player shall be the Vote
      Collector for the entire duration of the Referendum.

      If the Vote Collector deregisters or is deregistered before the
      Voting Period ends, the Election has no Winner.

      eirself in an Election. On Hold status is measured at the time a
      Player makes a Nomination.

      * Nominations: A Nominating Entity makes a Nomination by sending
      a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominations Period,
      indicating what Election e is Nominating for.

      * Candidates: A Player who has Nominated for an Election is
      called a Candidate for that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nomination, once sent to the Vote Collector, may
      be retracted before the end of the Nominating Period. A player
      may retract a Nomination e has made by sending a message to the
      Vote  Collector, indicating the e wished to retract eir
      Nomination.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the
      time of the first correct and legal announcement that the
      Election has begun, as required by the Rules calling for the
      Election.

      the Public Forum, as soon as possible after the Nominating
      Period is over, the names of all Players who Nominated for the
      Election.

      If there are no Candidates in a given Election, then that
      Election shall have no Winner. If there is only one Candidate in
      a given Election, then that Candidate shall be the Winner of
      that Election.

      In all other cases, a Referendum shall being at the time

      Public Forum.

      * Quorum: Quorum shall be set at 50% of the eligible Voting
      Entities at the beginning of the Voting Period. If a smaller
      fraction voted, the Election has no Winner.

      Vote Collector announces that there is to be no Referendum.

      * Cutoff for Challenges: Any challenge of the correctness of the
      announced results of an Election must be made within seven days
      of the time the results are announced.  If seven days pass from
      the time the results are announced without a challenge, the

Rule 1659/2 (Power=1)
The Right to call Elections

      Any Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right to call Elections.
      This is the Right to declare any number of Offices to be held
      temporarily.  This Right is exercised by posting an announcement
      in the Public Forum that both lists a number of Offices
      currently held in normal fashion, and declares that the Speaker
      is exercising eir Right to call these Elections.  If the Speaker
      posts such a message, is not Tainted at the time of posting, and
      has not exercised this Right since e last became Speaker, all
      such Offices listed in this post are then held temporarily.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1626/1 (Power=1)
Applications

      An Application is any body of text designated as such by a
      Player.  This Player is known as its Sponsor.

      A Player's Signature is added to an Application when e sends a
      message to that Application's Sponsor indicating that e wishes
      to sign it.

      A Player's Signature is stricken from the Application when e
      sends a message to the Sponsor of the Application stating that e
      wishes eir signature stricken.  Further, the Sponsor of an
      Application may strike any Signature from the Application at any
      time.

      If an Application is amended in any way (except to add or strike
      a Signature), any and all Signatures which appear on it are
      stricken from it.

      An Application is Executed when its Sponsor submits it to
      whatever Officer or other Player is designated by the Rules to
      receive Applications of that particular type, with whatever
      effect is defined by the Rules for the Execution of that type of
      Application.  However, any other Rule notwithstanding, the
      Execution of an Application shall have no effect unless Executed
      within 14 days of the time the oldest Signature which appears on
      it was added.

      If a Player Executes an Application which contains Signatures
      added to it in a manner inconsistent with this Rule, e commits
      the Crime of Application Fraud, a Class D Crime.

Calling for Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/3 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any Player who seeks formal resolution of any dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic shall be permitted to request such by submitting a
      Call for Judgement to the Clerk of the Courts.  For the purpose
      of this and other Rules, the submission of a Call for Judgement
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      Any document submitted to the Clerk of the Courts and which is
      clearly marked as a Call for Judgement is a Call for Judgement.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a Call for Judgement,
      along with any additional material submitted by the Caller
      (including, but not limited to, Arguments and Evidence) not
      later than the time e announces the identity of the first Judge
      assigned to Judge it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 897/1 (Power=1)
Barring Players from Judgement

      The Player who submits a Call for Judgement is permitted to
      specify up to three Players who are to be Barred from Judging
      that CFJ.  Any Players that are so Barred are ineligible to
      Judge that CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1562/3 (Power=1)
Excess CFJs

      The Clerk of the Courts shall dismiss without prejudice any CFJ
      made by a Player who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during that Nomic Week.  Such a CFJ is called an "excess CFJ".
      The Player who submits an excess CFJ commits the Infraction of
      Excess CFJing, to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts and
      bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT.

      If the Clerk of the Courts fails to dismiss an excess CFJ, and
      instead assigns it to a Judge, then the CFJ shall not be
      dismissed for being an excess CFJ and shall be Judged (or
      dismissed) exactly as any other CFJ.  Failing to dismiss an
      excess CFJ is the Infraction of Allowing Excess CFJing, to be
      reported by the Justiciar, and bearing a penalty of 0.5 VT and
      two Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1563/2 (Power=1)
Statement of a CFJ

      In order to be Judged, a Call for Judgement must contain a
      single clearly-labeled Statement which must be able to be
      determined by the means of logical reasoning, with the
      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating
      eir Judgement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Selecting a Judge
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 951/10 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      randomly select a Player to be assigned as its Judge.  This
      selection shall be made from amongst all those Players eligible
      to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once assigned as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is recused from that CFJ, or e ceases
      to be a Player.

      The Clerk shall announce the identity of the Player who is
      assigned to Judge a CFJ as soon as possible after the selection
      is made.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is
      not open is closed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 698/3 (Power=1)
Always an Eligible Judge

      Every Active Player is eligible to Judge a a given CFJ unless
      specifically made ineligible by some Rule.

      The Caller of a given CFJ is never eligible to Judge that CFJ.

      If there would otherwise be no Players eligible to Judge a CFJ,
      then all Active Players, excluding the Caller and those Players
      Barred by the Caller, shall be eligible, any other Rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players (Active or not), excluding
      the Caller and those Players Barred by the Caller, shall be
      eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any Players
      eligible to Judge, then all Players, excluding the Caller, shall
      be eligible.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule or combination of Rules
      which would result in there being no Players eligible to Judge a
      given CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1567/5 (Power=1)
Making Oneself Ineligible To Judge a CFJ

      A Player makes emself ineligible to be the Judge of a specific
      CFJ by transmitting a notice to the Clerk of the Courts,
      specifying the CFJ for which e wishes to be made ineligible.

      If, at the time a Player makes emself ineligible to be a Judge
      of a CFJ in this manner had already been selected as the Judge
      of that CFJ, the Clerk of the Courts shall bill that Player a
      fee of 0.5 VT and shall recuse that Player as the Judge of that
      CFJ.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1568/4 (Power=1)
Judges On Hold

      Any Player who goes on Hold while selected as the Judge of one
      or more CFJs commits the Infraction of Judge Inactivity.  This
      Infraction is to be reported by the Clerk of the Courts, and has
      a penalty of 0.5 VT times the number of CFJs for which the
      Player was selected as Judge when e went On Hold.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1756/0 (Power=1)
Delinquent Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall recuse from a CFJ any Judge who is
      delinquent upon the demand of any two Players.  A Player demands
      the recusal of a delinquent Judge by posting eir demand in the
      Public Forum.

      A Judge recused for delinquency commits the Infraction of
      Judicial Delinquency, which bears a penalty of 2 Blots to be
      reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

Delivering Judgement
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 408/9 (Power=1)
Accepting Judge-ship

      The Player assigned to Judge a Call for Judgement is required to
      either return a Judgement upon that CFJ or dismiss that CFJ
      within the assigned deliberation period, which ends seven days
      after e is assigned to Judge it.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Judging Late, detected
      and reported by the CotC. At the time of the report of
      infraction, if the CFJ has been Judged or dismissed then the
      penalty is 1 VT and the Judgement or dismissal is legal even
      though delivered late.  Otherwise the penalty is 3 Blots, and
      the Judge becomes ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and a new Judge
      shall be assigned in the usual manner.

      A Judge who has neither judged nor dismissed a CFJ within seven
      days after the end of the assigned deliberation period becomes
      ineligible to Judge that CFJ, and any Judgement or Dismissal
      submitted after this time is not legal and shall not be accepted
      by the CotC.

      However, if the Player assigned to Judge a CFJ ceases to be
      eligible before judging or dismissing that CFJ, then e is
      neither required nor permitted to either return a Judgement on,
      or dismiss, that CFJ, and ceases to be the Judge assigned to
      that CFJ at the moment e becomes ineligible.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 591/12 (Power=1)
Legal Judgements

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgment to the Clerk of the
      Courts.  The Judgement of a CFJ must be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall distribute the Judgement to the Public Forum.

      A Judge who delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period shall receive a Judicial
      Salary of 1 VT.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 217/3 (Power=1)
Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however,
      if the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the
      Statement to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game
      custom, commonsense, past Judgements, and the best interests of
      the game before applying other standards.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1575/2 (Power=1)
Standards of Proof

      A CFJ alleging that a Player has violated a Rule or committed a
      Crime shall not be judged TRUE unless the evidence is sufficient
      to be certain of that Judgement beyond reasonable doubt.

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  No Player shall be
      convicted of a Crime if this defense applies.

Evidentiary Status of Officer Reports

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

Rule 451/4 (Power=1)
Determination of Judgement--Timing

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement

      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1565/6 (Power=1)
Dismissal of a CFJ

      A Judge must dismiss a CFJ if one of the following is true of
      it:

        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
           Rules.
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must post to the Public Forum a notice of the dismissal
      and the Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary of 1 VT.

CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been set
aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new Judge
selected from among those eligible, who then has one week to deliver a
Judgement.

Salary for Judges

      The Clerk of the Courts shall, within one week of the time a
      Player earns a Judicial Salary, pay out that Judicial Salary to
      that Player.

      If a decision (or dismissal) which resulted in a Player earning
      a Judicial Salary is subsequently appealed and overturned on
      appeal, the Clerk of the Court shall vacate the Payment Order
      paying the salary originally received for that decision.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1571/2 (Power=1)
Legal Force of Injunctions

      A legally made Injunction takes effect 72 hours from its
      publication by the CotC in the Public Forum. If, before it takes
      effect, either the Injunction or the Judgement it accompanies is
      appealed, its effect is deferred until the resolution of the
      appeal(s).

      If an appeal involving an Injunction which has not taken effect,
      and which was originally attached to a Judgement, or the
      Judgement to which it is attached resolves, and neither the
      Injunction nor the Judgement has been overturned, and no other
      appeal is pending on the Injunction or the Judgement, the
      Injunction takes effect immediately upon resolution of the
      appeal.

      If an appeal fails to uphold an Injunction, or the Judgement
      it accompanies, the Injunction is set aside immediately upon
      resolution of that appeal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1573/3 (Power=1)
Penalties for Violations of Injunctions

      A Player is required to perform all actions required of em by a
      legal Injunction within 72 hours of it taking effect, unless the
      Injunction is set aside prior to that time.  Failure to do so is
      the Crime of Violating an Injunction by Omission, a Class C
      Crime.

      A Player is required to refrain from all actions prohibited em
      by a legal Injunction, for the duration that it is in effect.
      Each performance of such an action is the Crime of Violating an
      Injunction by Commission, a Class C Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over all other Rules pertaining to
      Injunctions.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 789/3 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Interpretations of Rules

      A CFJ alleging a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way
      must be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by
      the Caller, which includes the Rule being interpreted.

      If the Judge finds this CFJ's Statement TRUE, e is permitted to
      issue an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate the
      Rule in question with that Statement and the list of relevant
      Rules.  This annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that Rule.

      The annotation is removed once any change occurs in a Rule from
      the list of relevant Rules.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances leading to the
      Judgement no longer prevail, rendering the annotation
      inapplicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is Judged
      TRUE, the annotation is removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1500/4 (Power=1)
Injunctions on the Interpretation of SLC's

      A CFJ alleging a SLC should be interpreted in a certain way must
      be accompanied by a list of relevant Rules, assembled by the
      Caller.

      If the Judge finds this CFJ's Statement TRUE, e is permitted to
      issue an Injunction requiring the Maintainer of the SLC to
      annotate the SLC with that Statement and the list of relevant
      Rules.  This annotation, while it exists, shall guide
      application of that SLC.

      The annotation is removed once any change occurs in a Rule from
      the list of relevant Rules.

      If a Player believes that the circumstances leading to the
      Judgement no longer prevail, rendering the annotation
      inapplicable, e may submit a CFJ to that effect. If it is Judged
      TRUE, the annotation is removed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1736/0 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Payment Orders

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1737/0 (Power=1)
Injunctions on Vacating Payment Orders

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering that a Payment Order be vacated.  If the
      Payment Order named by such an Injunction is vacated, and the
      Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who vacated that
      Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the Injunction
      was set aside, execute a new Payment Order identical to the
      vacated Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/0 (Power=1)
Agreements Between Players

      If two (or more) Players enter into an agreement, but one (or
      more) of these Players then fails to comply with that agreement,
      any other Player party to that agreement may make a CFJ alleging
      that that agreement has been broken.

      If the Judge of such a CFJ finds that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, e is permitted to issue Injunctions binding upon
      any or all of the parties of the broken agreement so as to
      effect fair and appropriate restitution for its breach.  When
      restitution would involve the transfer of Currencies, the Judge
      is authorized to execute whatever Payment Orders are necessary
      to effect fair and appropriate restitution.

      The above notwithstanding, no restitution shall be available
      with respect to the breach of the agreement which would have
      required a Player to break the Rules, nor shall restitution
      include the execution of Payment Orders, the payor of which is
      any entity not party to the agreement.

      Nothing in this Rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      A CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement lacks standing and
      shall be dismissed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1365/6 (Power=1)
Concurring and Dissenting Opinions

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application
      to Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has
      the effect of annotating a Judgement or Dismissal in a given
      Call for Judgement.  In order for such an Application to have
      effect upon Execution, it must satisfy the following
      requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement or Dismissal to
        which it applies is that of the Judge or that of the
        Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be Executed no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement or Dismissal to which it applies, and no later than
        one week after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of
        that Judgement or Dismissal.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having
      been Executed and having met all the requirements for
      effectiveness, is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred
      to as a Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as
      indicated in the Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is Executed and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement or Dismissal.

Rule 911/8 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E was not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration when it was called, and this
           restriction does not prevent three eligible Players from
           being selected by the CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

      The Speaker and the Player holding the Office of the Clerk of
      the Courts are not permitted to nominate in any Election for the
      Office of Justiciar.

      If the Player holding the Office of Justiciar becomes either

      including in eir announcement the matter of consideration of the
      Appeal and the identity of the Justices selected to serve on the
      Board of Appeals and which (if any) of these Players are
      ineligible to fill the positions to which they have been
      assigned.

      The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public Forum as
      soon as possible after any change in the identity of the
      Justices that takes place after the Board has been constituted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1564/8 (Power=1)
Initiating Appeals

      Specific elements of a Judge's decision are subject to review by
      the Board of Appeals.  Such elements are limited to those
      specified in this Rule.

      In each case, the insistence of any three Players, posted in the
      Public Forum, shall initiate a particular appeal.

      The insistence of a single Player shall initiate an appeal if
      the appeal is of an Injunction which names the insisting Player,
      if the appeal is of a Judgement that found a Crime had been
      committed by the insisting Player, or if the insisting Player is
      the Judge who made the decision that is appealed.

      The elements that are permitted to be appealed, what the Board
      is to consider, and what results from its findings, are as
      follows:

        i) The Judgement of the CFJ;
       ii) The Dismissal of a CFJ;
      iii) An Injunction issued with a Judgement.

      The proper procedure for these Appeals is detailed in other
      rules.

Rule 1447/11 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.

      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Infraction of Failing to Judge an
      Appeal, detected and reported by the CotC, bearing a penalty of
      3 Blots, which results in that Justice's dismissal as a Justice
      from that Board. In this case the CotC must randomly select an
      eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall post these determinations in the Public
      Forum along with any arguments, evidence, or other material
      included with those determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      Each Justice who submits eir determination to the CotC before
      the end of the assigned deliberation period shall receive a
      Judicial Salary of 1 VT each upon the publication of their
      determinations.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1693/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1694/0 (Power=1)
Appeal of a Dismissal

      If the dismissal of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board shall not
      consider the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they
      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

Rule 1695/1 (Power=1)
Appeal of an Injunction

      If an Injuction issued with a Judgement is Appealed, the
      Board shall consider the legality and appropriateness of
      the Injunction.

      If the Board finds that the Injuction was made legally,
      and was appropriate for the situation, it shall have normal
      effect.

      If the Board finds that the Injunction was made illegally,
      or that it was inappropriate for the situation, the
      Injunction shall be set aside. The original Judge is
      guilty of the Infraction of Wrongful Injunction, the
      penalty for which is 2 Blots; the CotC shall detect and
      report this penalty.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1725/0 (Power=1)
Appeal to Append an Injunction

      If a Judgement issued without an Injunction is Appealed to
      Append an Injunction, the Board shall consider whether an
      Injunction would be appropriate.

      If the Board rules that an Injunction on the Judgement in
      question would be appropriate, and all members of the Board
      agree as to what Injunction to Append, the Injunction is made.
      Such an Injunction is legal if and only if it would have been
      legal, had it been made by the original judge.

      If the Board rules that an Injunction would not be appropriate,
      or does not agree as to which Injunction should be made, no
      Injunction is made.

======================================================================
Rule Violations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 908/10 (Power=1)
Formal Apologies

      If a Call for Judgement alleges that a Player (herein called the
      Ninny) has acted or has failed to act in such a way as to be in
      violation of one or more Rules, or to have committed one or more
      Crimes, and this CFJ is Judged TRUE, then the Ninny must submit
      to the Public Forum a Formal Apology within 72 hours of the
      publication of Judgement, unless that Judgement is successfully
      appealed within 72 hours.

      By a Formal Apology is meant a letter of at least 200 words,
      containing all of the Prescribed Words (if any were prescribed)
      explaining the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
      for self-improvement.

      A Judge deciding TRUE in such a CFJ may issue an Injunction
      including a list of up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's
      choice, and ordering that the Ninny's Formal Apology must
      include the Prescribed Words.

      If the Ninny fails to meet these criteria e shall gain 3 Blots.

      The Player who called the initial CFJ has the duty to report to
      the Herald any Blots gained through this rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Crimes and Infractions
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1503/3 (Power=1)
Crimes and Infractions

      The Rules can penalize Players for performing, or failing to
      perform, some specific action.  Such penalized actions, or
      failures to act, are defined as either Crimes or Infractions.

      A Player shall only be subject to the penalty for a Crime after
      a CFJ has explicitly found that the Player has committed that
      Crime, or after an appeal to a Judgement finds so.

      A Player shall be subject to the penalty for an Infraction as
      soon as it is reported by the Player in charge of detecting
      that Infraction.

      There are no Crimes or Infractions outside those defined in the
      Rules.  If a Rule defines a Crime or Infraction without
      specifying an explicit penalty, or a class of penalty that is
      defined in the Rules, then that Crime or Infraction imposes no
      penalty.

      Any Rule that defines an Infraction must also specify a
      Player or Players who are authorized to detect and report
      the commission of that Infraction; otherwise, the Infraction
      carries no penalty.

      Any penalties reported by unauthorized persons have no effect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1504/5 (Power=1)
Application and Timing of Crimes and Infractions

      When a CFJ determines that a Player has committed a Crime, the
      Judge is required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of
      the Courts to execute Payment Orders required to apply the
      penalty specified for that Crime.

      If an appeal finds the Crime did not occur, the penalty shall
      not be applied.  If the penalty has already been applied, then
      the penalty shall be reversed to the extent possible immediately
      upon resolution of the appeal.

      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.  If a CFJ later finds
      that the Infraction did not occur, the Judge of that CFJ is
      required to issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the
      Courts to vacate the Payment Order(s) originally executed to
      apply the penalty.

CFJ 939, Sep. 16, 1997: The provision in R1504 which states that:
      Penalties for Infractions are applied immediately upon their
      legal report, and the Player making the report of the Infraction
      shall execute whatever Payment Order(s) are required to apply
      the penalty specified for that Infraction.
should be interpreted such that penalties for Infractions are applied
immediately upon the legal report of the *penalties*, not the legal
report of the Infractions.
Relevant Rules: 1504, 1599

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1652/0 (Power=1)
Double Jeopardy

      No Player shall be subject to the application of more than one
      penalty for each specific instance of a particular Crime or
      Infraction.

      For any single act (or failure to act), a Player can only once
      be subject to the penalty of each Crime of Infraction resulting
      from that act.  If the penalties for any one Crime or Infraction
      are reversed upon appeal, such penalties may not be reinstated
      for that particular Crime or Infraction based upon that specific
      act.

      This Rule does not forbid the re-application of a penalty whose
      reversal is rescinded by CFJ or an appeal to a CFJ.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that applies Crimes or
      Infractions, or the penalties thereof.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1505/6 (Power=1)
Standard Classes of Crimes

      The following Classes of Crime are defined, with the listed
      penalties:

      Class B Crime:
        The Player receives 10 Blots and loses 10 VTs.

      Class C Crime:
        The Player receives 4 Blots and loses 4 VTs.

      Class D Crime:
        The Player receives 2 Blots and loses 2 VTs.

      Class E Crime:
        The Player receives 1 Blot and loses 1 VT.

      Class 1 Crime:
        The Player receives 1 Blot.

      Class 2 Crime:
        The Player receives 2 Blots.

      Class 3 Crime:
        The Player receives 3 Blots.

      Class 4 Crime:
        The Player receives 4 Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1509/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Recourse for Nonreporting of Infractions

      Any Player who believes that an Infraction has occurred, but
      which has not been reported by a Player authorized to report it,
      is permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging thus.

      If the Judgement of the CFJ upholds the allegation, then the
      Judge of the CFJ shall be authorized to, and shall be obligated
      to, report the Infraction as provided by other Rules.  This Rule
      takes precedence over any Rule which would prevent the Judge's
      report of an infraction from having legal effect.

The Distributor
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1670/6 (Power=1)

      Ruleset to the Public Forum at least once each month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1681/2 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title
        * The Rule's text
        * Any annotations to the Rule required by Injunction.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, Rules are assigned to the
      same Category and presented in the same order as in the
      SLR.  The FLR must contain all the information required
      to be in the SLR, as well as:
        * A brief description of each Category
        * Any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is
          required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the Ruleset in the
      FLR.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1048/6 (Power=1)
Rule Categories

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify an existing
      Category to which the new Rule will be assigned.  If it does
      not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the new Rule's Category.  When
      doing so, the Rulekeepor may create a new Rule Category and
      assign the Rule to this new Category.

      The Rulekeepor may remove an empty Rule Category as e sees fit.

      If the Rulekeepor creates or removes a Category, e must announce
      it in the Public Forum no later than the first subsequent
      publication of the Logical Ruleset.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the name of a Rule
      Category or change the Category to which a Rule is assigned
      Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1691/0 (Power=1)
Category of New Rules

      A new Rule shall be assigned to whatever Rule Category is
      specified by the instrument which created it, if the Rule
      Category specified exists.  If there is no such specification or
      a category which does not exist is specified, the Rulekeepor
      shall assign the Rule to an appropriate Rule Category of eir own
      choice.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1485/7 (Power=1)
Titles For Rules

      All Rules have a Title, which is a single line of text
      containing not more than 60 characters.  The Title must be
      listed by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule.  However, the
      Title is not part of the Rule itself and has no effect on the
      meaning or application of the Rule, being merely a convenience
      for the Players.

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify a Title for
      the new Rule.  If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the
      new Rule's Title.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the Title of a Rule
      Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1430/2 (Power=1)
Mandatory Rule Annotations

      Whenever a Rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the Rule giving the type of
      change, the source of the Change (that is, the Number of the
      Proposal and the Entity that proposed it, or Rule-- or other
      entity-- which mandated the Change), and the date upon which the
      change took effect.  Other Rules may require additional
      information to appear in an annotation for certain types of Rule
      Change.

      Such an annotation does not in any way affect the Rule itself,
      is not part of the text of the Rule, and is not a Rule Change in
      its own regard.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all annotations
      in such a way that they are readily distinguished from the text
      of the Rule.

      When a Rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

Duties of the Archivist

      The duties of the Nomic Archivist shall be as follows:

         i) to record the passage and failure of Proposals,

      iii) to maintain a list of Judgements and their case histories,

       iv) to maintain copies of prior Officer reports, and

        v) to maintain a list of game Winners in past games.

      The Archivist is free to comment on the historical records as e
      sees fit, but such commentary must be clearly delimited from the
      historical material.  The Archivist is free to design a
      classification method for the material e stores.

      The "historical record" of the Ruleset maintained by the
      Archivist is one that includes all rules ever part of the Agora
      Ruleset, annotated with information as to their ultimate fate,
      whether Repealed or Amended etc. This record of the Ruleset has
      no legal force.

The Agoraverse
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1706/1 (Power=1)
Locations

      There is a class of Entities called Locations.  Each Location
      has a unique name.  The Agoraverse is the set of all Locations.

      There is a Property called Position, the value of which is a
      Location.  The Position of a Location is itself.  "An Entity's
      Location" is an unambiguous reference to that Entity's Position,
      and the Entity is said to be "at that Location".

      There is a Location named "the Origin".  The initial Location of
      any Entity with a Location is the Origin, unless otherwise
      specified.  If a Location ceases to be a Location, then the
      Location of all Entities at that Location becomes the Origin.

      All Players have a Location.

      The Cartographor is authorized to change the name of any
      Location not specifically mentioned by name in the Rules
      Without Objection.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1707/1 (Power=1)
Movement

      Any change in an Entity's Location is known as Movement.

      An Entity Moves when its Executor tells the Cartographor which
      Location it Moves to, given that the Movement is otherwise
      permitted by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1708/2 (Power=1)
Adjacency

      Two Locations may be Adjacent.  Adjacency is commutative and
      antireflexive.

      Entities may Move to a Location Adjacent to their current
      Location, unless prohibited by another Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1709/0 (Power=1)
Distance

      A Path is an ordered sequence of one or more Locations such that
      each Location in the Path is Adjacent to both the Location
      preceding it (if any) and the Location following it (if any).
      A Path is said to be "from" the first Location in the sequence
      and "to" the last Location in the sequence.

      The Length of a Path is one less than the number of Locations in
      it.

      The Distance between two Locations (which may be identical) is
      the minimum Length of a Path from the first to the second.  If
      there is no such Path, then the Distance between them is
      undefined.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1710/0 (Power=1)
The Cartographor

      There is an Office of Cartographor.

      At least once each Nomic Week, the Cartographor shall post a

      information:

       * all Locations, and which Locations are Adjacent to which
         others
       * the Location of all Entities that have a Location
       * all Movement since the previous such Report (if any)

      have been awarded, and to whom they have been awarded, with the
      exception of any such events of which the Rules state that they
      have no Historical Significance.  This list is known as the Gold
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1044/5 (Power=1)
Unique Patent Titles

      Let there exist a class of Patent Titles known as Unique Patent
      Titles.  At most one person may hold a specific Unique Patent
      Title at any one time.  Unique Patent Titles are the
      same as Patent Titles in all other respects.

      Zeitgeist lose the Title whenever it is newly awarded.  The
      Assessor is responsible for detecting and reporting the awarding
      of this Patent Title.

      When a Player is awarded the Patent Title of Zeitgeist, the
      Assessor shall pay out one P-Note to that Player.

======================================================================
Degrees and Theses
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1367/2 (Power=1)
Degrees

      There shall exist a subset of the Patent Titles known as
      Degrees. A Patent Title is only a Degree if it is specifically
      made such by a Rule. A person may use a Degree with their name
      for any official or unofficial business if and only if that
      person currently possesses that Degree.

      Persons may come to possess Degrees only as specified in the
      Rules. Once a person possesses a Degree, e shall keep that
      Degree forever.

      The Registrar shall note in eir report which persons possess

Rule 1369/0 (Power=1)
Theses

      There shall be a Nomic Entity known as a Thesis, plural Theses.

      A Thesis shall be an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora
      Nomic, or Nomic in general. The topic should be substantially
      different from all other Theses previously approved, but this
      is not a requirement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1370/8 (Power=1)
How To Get A Degree

      A Degree is Granted by the operation of an instrument of
      sufficient Power specifying the Degree to be Granted, and its
      recipient.  The sufficient Power required to Grant a Degree is
      determined by the Degree to be Granted.  All conditions
      established by this and other Rules for the Granting of the
      named Degree must have been fulfilled before the Degree may be
      Granted.

      No Degree may be Granted to any recipient unless the recipient
      has posted a Thesis to the Public Forum authored by eirself,
      along with a statement explicitly indicating that the Thesis is
      being submitted with the intent to qualify for a Degree.  The
      Archivist shall retain a copy of each Thesis posted in this
      manner.

      The Degree of Bachelor of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 1.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic History shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words and contains a narrative covering significant events
      which have occured in Agora within at least the last eight
      weeks, and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power
      of at least 2.

      The Degree of Master of Nomic shall not be Granted unless the
      Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least 500 words,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 2.

      The Degree of Doctor of Nomic Philosophy shall not be Granted
      unless the Thesis submitted for that Degree contains at least
      500 words, unless the intended recipient has also posted in the
      Public Forum an additional creative work authored by emself
      whose topic or theme is related to Agora or Nomic in general,
      and unless the instrument Granting the Degree has Power of at
      least 3.

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      A Nomic Entity (other than a person who is not a Player) which
      has no Executor, or whose Executor is not a Player, may not
      perform any action except when required to do so by the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1577/2 (Power=1)
Minimum Unit Quantities (MUQ)

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Minimum Unit
      Quantity (MUQ).  This quantity is the smallest amount of that
      Currency which is permitted to be transferred.  All transfers
      and holdings of a Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest
      multiple of its MUQ.

      The MUQ of a given Currency is 1 if no other specification
      exists.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1578/3 (Power=1)
Currency Recordkeepors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Recordkeepor,
      which must be a Player.  The Recordkeepor of a Currency is
      required to maintain a record of the amounts of that Currency
      held by the various entities which possess units of that
      Currency.

      If the designated Recordkeepor of a Currency ceases to be a
      Player, the Speaker shall fulfill that responsibilty until a new
      Recordkeepor is selected according to whatever procedure
      applies.  If there is no procedure defined for selecting a new
      Recordkeepor, then all units of that Currency are destroyed and
      the Currency ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1579/5 (Power=1)
Mintors

      Each Currency shall have associated with it a Mintor, which must
      be an entity to which the Rules grant Mint Authority.  An entity
      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publically announce when
      this happens.

      All Players have Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1722/0 (Power=1)
Minting of Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority posts to the Public Forum a message stating that e is
      doing so, provided that also e states in that message the values
      of all properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The
      Mintor of a Currency created in this way is the entity which
      created it, any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.
      If the Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the
      Executor of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first
      consent to being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is
      created.

      A Currency is destroyed when Mintor of that Currency posts in
      the Public Forum stating that e is doing so, unless this
      destruction would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1721/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor

      There shall exist the Office of Chancellor.

      The Chancellor shall retain a schedule, listing every Currency
      which exists, detailing for each Currency the Name, Mintor,
      Recordkeepor, and MUQ of that Currency.  This schedule shall be
      posted to the Public Forum by the Chancellor at least once in
      each Month.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Currencies

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1599/3 (Power=1)
Failure to Execute Payment Orders

      Whenever a Rule requires a Player execute a Payment Order, e is
      required to do so within seven days.  If a Player who is
      required to execute a Payment Order by the Rules fails to do so
      in the time required by this and other Rules, and a CFJ
      determines that this has in fact happened, the Judge of that CFJ
      shall make an Injunction requiring emself to execute the Order
      required in the stead of the nonperforming Player.  If a Player
      deregisters or goes On Hold without executing a Payment Order
      which e was required to execute, the Speaker shall execute it
      instead.

      If a Player who is required to execute a Payment Order executes
      it and then subsequently vacates it, e is still required to
      execute that Order, as if e had never executed it, unless e was
      required by the Rules to vacate that particular Order.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which specifies a different time
      limit for executing Payment Orders.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1598/5 (Power=1)
Transfer Orders

      A Transfer Order is an order requiring the Recordkeepor of a
      Currency to note the transfer of units of that Currency from one
      entity to another.  An Transfer Order specifies exactly one
      source entity, exactly one destination entity, exactly one
      Currency, and a number of units of that Currency which is a
      positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Transfer Order is submitted when the Executor of the source
      entity specified in the Order transmits the Order to the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency specified in the Order, or whenever
      the Rules otherwise state that a Transfer Order is submitted.
      Unless otherwise specified, a Transfer Order is executed upon
      being submitted.  In no case may any Transfer Order be executed
      prior to its submission or without having ever been submitted.

      When a Transfer Order is executed, if the source possesses at
      least as many units of the specified Currency as specified in
      the Order, the number of units of that specified Currency shall
      be removed from the source entity and added to the destination
      entity.  Such an Order is said to have been successfully
      executed.

      However, if the source entity does not possess sufficient units
      of the specified Currency, then no transfer occurs, and the
      Recordkeepor shall, as soon as possible, notify the Executors of
      the source and destination that the Transfer Order was not
      successfully executed.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Transfer Orders
      submitted which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor, for at least four weeks after their execution.

      The determination, for the purpose of this Rule, of whether an
      entity has sufficient Currency to execute a transfer shall be
      made based on the Recordkeepor's records at the time the
      transfer is executed.  A Recordkeepor's good faith determination
      that a transfer has succeeded or failed is definitive, even if
      it is based on erroneous information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1746/0 (Power=1)
Illegal Transfer Orders

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.

      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1730/0 (Power=1)
Delayed Transfer Orders

      If the Executor of the source entity specifies a later time
      (possibly implicitly) at which the Order is to be executed, then
      the Order is executed at that time, unless cancelled prior to
      that time.  An order of this latter type is called a "delayed
      Transfer Order."

      A delayed Transfer Order is cancelled when the Executor of its
      source entity transmits a message to the Recordkeepor cancelling
      that order.

      A Recordkeepor may reject a delayed Transfer Order by informing
      the Executor of the source entity of the Order that e is
      rejecting the Order because it is delayed (and for no other
      reason); if e does so, that Transfer Order is discarded and
      shall not be executed.  However, a Recordkeepor may not reject a
      delayed Transfer Order when e is specifically prohibited from
      rejecting such an Order.  In no case may a Recordkeepor reject a
      Transfer Order which is not delayed.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules pertaining to the
      execution of Transfer Orders, and the timing thereof.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1596/2 (Power=1)
Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is an order requiring an entity (the payor) to
      submit a Transfer Order transferring units of a Currency from
      itself to some other entity (the payee).  A Payment Order
      specifies exactly one source entity, exactly one destination
      entity, exactly one Currency, and a number of units of that
      Currency which is a positive multiple of that Currency's MUQ.

      A Payment Order is executed when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts the Order to the Public
      Forum.

      A Player only has the authority to execute a Payment Order if e
      required to execute that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em authority to execute that
      Order.

      Each Recordkeepor shall maintain a record of all Payment Orders
      executed which specify the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor; this record shall also indicate, for each Order,
      whether that Order has been satisfied, is disputed, or has been
      vacated.  However, the Recordkeepor need only maintain records
      of satisfied or vacated Orders for four weeks after they have
      been satisfied or vacated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1732/1 (Power=1)
Satisfaction of Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is satisfied when a Transfer Order from the
      payor named in that Payment Order to the payee of that Payment
      Order for the currency and amount named in that Payment Order is
      successfully executed, provided that, when that Transfer Order
      was submitted, its submitter clearly indicated that that
      Transfer Order was being submitted for the purpose of satisfying
      the Payment Order in question.

      A given Payment Order can be satisfied at most once.  A vacated
      Payment Order cannot be satisfied.

      A given Transfer Order may be used for the purpose of satisfying
      at most one Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1733/0 (Power=1)
Disputed Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is disputed if there is a COE regarding it which
      has not been denied, or a CFJ challenging the legality of its
      execution which is either presently assigned to a Judge or to a
      Board of Appeals for consideration.

      When a a COE regarding a Payment Order is accepted, the order
      shall be vacated (and an new order issued, if appropriate).  The
      Judge of a CFJ which finds that a Payment Order was illegally or
      improperly executed shall make an Injunction requiring the Clerk
      of the Courts to vacate the illegal Payment Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1734/0 (Power=1)
Vacated Payment Orders

      A Payment Order is vacated when a Player with the authority to
      do so (as defined by the Rules) posts to the Public Forum a
      notice to the effect that a given Payment Order is being
      vacated.  This notice must clearly identify the Payment Order
      being vacated.

      When a satisfied Payment Order is vacated, the Recordkeepor of
      the Currency in that Payment Order shall execute a new Payment
      Order identical to the vacated Payment Order, but with the payor
      and payee interchanged.

      A Player only has the authority to vacate a Payment Order if e
      is the Player who originally executed that Order, if e is
      required to vacate that Order by the Rules or by an Injunction,
      or if the Rules otherwise grant em the authority to vacate that
      Order.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1754/0 (Power=1)
Inadvertent Transfers to the Bank

      If an entity transfers Currency to the Bank without specifying a
      purpose for doing so, or if e specifies a purpose for doing so,
      but the transfer fails to accomplish that purpose, the Bank
      shall, as soon as possible, transfer that Currency back to that
      entity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1713/3 (Power=1)
Debt

      An Overdue Payment Order is a Payment Order which was executed
      more than seven days ago, which has been neither satisfied nor
      vacated, and which is not subject to dispute.

      The Executor of an entity for which, at the beginning of a given
      Nomic week, there is at least one Overdue Payment Order naming
      it as Payor commits the Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness at
      the beginning of that Week.  If an entity has more than one
      Overdue Payment Order naming it as payor, its Executor commits
      as many such Infractions are there are different Currencies
      named in all these Overdue Payment Orders.

      The Recordkeepor of each Currency is authorized to report this
      Infraction with respect to the Currency of which e is the
      Recordkeepor.  This Infraction carries a penalty of one Blot.

      With the exception of this paragraph, this Rule shall have no
      effect prior to the first day of December, 1997.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1661/4 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage.  This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, order the award of
      specific currencies from the Bank to specific Players, only as
      specified in this Rule.

      The Speaker exercises this right by posting to the Public Forum
      a Payment Order from the Bank to one Player for not more
      than 1 unit of any one Currency Minted by the Bank.  The Player
      to receive the award must not have received a Patronage award
      within the preceding four weeks, and the Speaker must provide a
      reason along with the Payment Order.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit of the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

======================================================================
Probate
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1601/4 (Power=1)
Probate

      The Notary shall place in Probate any entity which possesses
      Units of Currency or which is named as the Payee or Payor of any
      Payment Order, which does not have an Executor, and which is not
      already in Probate, as soon as possible after being made aware
      of this condition.

      No entity may be destroyed while it possesses Units of Currency
      or while it is named as the Payee or Payor of any Payment
      Orders; any attempt to destroy an entity while it is in this
      condition shall be deferred until this condition no longer
      holds, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding. An entity which
      would otherwise be destroyed but the destruction of which is
      being deferred due to the foregoing provisions is called
      'terminal'.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would destroy an
      entity while it possesses units of Currency.

      The following definitions apply with respect to entities in
      Probate:

      1. Assets: all units of Currency held by the entity in Probate,
         along with all Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      2. Debt: a Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as payor.

      3. Credit: a Payment Order naming the entity in Probate as
         payee.

      4. Creditor: an entity which is the payee of a debt.

      5. Debtor: an entity which is the payor of a credit.

      6. Heir: an entity named in the Will (if any) of the entity in
         Probate.

      7. Estate: the assets and debts of the entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1637/2 (Power=1)
Wills

      A Will is an SLC.  The Jurisdiction of a Will is always empty.
      Each Will belongs to exactly one entity.  The Notary
      shall be the Maintainer of all Wills.

      A Will shall specify the heirs of the entity to which it
      belongs, and how the currencies possessed by that entity and
      its other assets will be divided amongst those heirs when that
      treasury is placed in Probate.  When an entity's Will is
      executed, the Executor in Probate of that entity will first
      submit all the Transfer Orders required by the Will (excepting
      those which e cannot execute or cannot execute successfully, for
      whatever reason), and will then divide the remaining residual
      assets as provided by the Will.

      A Will is created or amended by the Execution of an Application
      to Create a Will.  Such an Application must clearly identify the
      entity to which the Will is to belong, requires the
      Signature of the Executor of the entity to which the Will is
      to belong, and is Executed by submitting it to the
      Notary.  The effect of Executing such an Application is to
      create a Will belonging to that entity.  Any prior Will
      belonging to that entity is destroyed at the same time.

      A Will belonging to an Organization is not an SLC associated to
      that Organization, as defined elsewhere.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1738/3 (Power=1)
Executors in Probate

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Trustee, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be that entity's
      Trustee.  E shall announce this appointment in the Public Forum.

      As soon as possible after the Notary announces the appointment
      of a Trustee for an entity in Probate, each Recordkeepor, with
      respect to the Currency of which e is the Recordkeepor, shall
      provide to that Trustee an accounting of the number of units of
      that Currency held by the entity in Probate, and a list of all
      Payment Orders naming the entity in Probate as either Payor or
      Payee.

      As soon as possible after the Trustee has received all of the
      reports required by the previous paragraph, e shall formulate
      and announce in the Public Forum a Plan for the disposition of
      the estate of the entity in Probate according to the provisions
      of the Probate Code.  However, if the Trustee determines, during
      the course of constructing the Plan, that any of the credits or
      debts of the entity in Probate is disputed, e shall announce
      this fact in the Public Forum, and shall neither formulate nor
      announce a Plan until after the dispute has been settled, and
      shall do so as soon as possible after the dispute has been
      settled.

      If no legally-made objection to the Plan is posted in the Public
      Forum during a waiting period of seven days following its
      announcement, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible after the
      expiration of thia waiting period, perform whatever steps are
      necessary to implement the Plan for disposition.  If there is a
      legally-made objection, the Trustee shall, as soon as possible
      after the objection is announced, formulate and announce a new
      Plan as above, repeating the process until there is no
      objection.

      However, if a CFJ is made alleging that an objection to a
      Trustee's Plan lacks foundation, then the Trustee shall neither
      formulate a new Plan nor implement the existing Plan until the
      CFJ is resolved.  If a CFJ finds that an objection lacks
      foundation, then the Trustee may proceed as if that objection
      had never been made, and any attempt to announce that same
      objection again is not legally made.

      An objection to a Plan for disposition has foundation if it
      properly alleges that:
        a) the Plan constructed is not in accord with the provisions
           of the Probate Code;
        b) the Plan disregards the Will (if any) of the entity in
           Probate;
        c) the implementation of the Plan as constructed would be
           substantially unfair to a creditor or heir of the entity in
           Probate; or
        d) the Plan would not fully dispose of the estate of the
           entity in Probate.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1739/1 (Power=1)
The Probate Code

      The Plan for the disposition of the estate of an entity in
      Probate shall be constructed by its Trustee as detailed below.

      First, the Plan shall divide the assets of the estate amongst
      its creditors, assigning to each creditor assets equal to the
      amount due that creditor if possible, or a pro-rata portion if
      not.  All debts, whether satisfied in full or not, shall be
      cancelled.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, the Plan shall apply
      the Will, if any, of the entity in Probate to the extent
      possible.  Any assets remaining after the application of the
      Will shall be divided amongst the heirs named in the Will,
      assigning to each heir a portion computed in a manner consistent
      with the Will; if the Will is silent or unclear on the division
      of remaining assets, the division shall be equal.

      Next, if the entity in Probate is terminal, and there is no Will
      or the Will fails to fully dispose of all assets of the entity
      in Probate, the Plan shall then cancel all remaining credits and
      assign all remaining units of Currency to the Bank.

      Units of Currency are assigned to an entity by requiring a
      Transfer Order for those Units of Currency from the entity in
      Probate to that Entity.

      A credit is assigned to an entity by requiring a Payment Order
      from the payor of the credit to the entity to whom it has been
      assigned; however, if the payor of the credit is the same as the
      entity to whom it is to be assigned, no Payment Order shall be
      required.

      A debt is cancelled by requiring the vacation of the Payment
      Order which established it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1757/1 (Power=1)
Implementation of Probate Plans

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate is empowered to submit on
      behalf of that entity whatever Transfer Orders are necessary to
      implement eir Plan for the disposition of that entity's Estate,
      as if e were that entity's Executor.  The Trustee may also
      execute and vacate Payment Orders when necessary to implement
      the Plan for the disposition of the Estate.

      The Trustee may exercise the above powers only when implementing
      a Plan for the disposition of the Estate of the entity in
      Probate of which e is the Trustee.

      The Trustee of an entity in Probate ceases to be Trustee when:
        a) e announces in the Public Forum that e resigns as Trustee;
        b) e ceases to be a Player;
        c) the entity of which e is Trustee ceases to be in Probate;
           or
        d) the Notary announces that e has been removed as Trustee.

      An entity in Probate ceases to be in Probate when its Trustee
      announces the completion the implementation of a Plan for the
      disposition of the Estate of that entity.

The Bank
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1470/2 (Power=1)
The Bank

      There shall exist a Nomic Entity called the Bank.  The Bank has
      Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1735/0 (Power=1)
The Chancellor as Bank's Executor

      The Chancellor is the Executor of the Bank.  As soon as possible
      after a Payment Order is executed for which the Bank is the
      payor, the Chancellor shall either (as the Bank's Executor)
      satisfy the Payment Order, or dispute it by making a COE or
      CFJ.  However, the Chancellor need not do so if another Player
      makes such a COE or CFJ first.

      If the Chancellor submits a Transfer Order from the Bank for any
      reason other than to satisfy a Payment Order (except when

The Accountor

      There is an Office of Accountor, whose Salary is 1.5 times the

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1442/12 (Power=1)
Voting and Voting Tokens

      A Voting Entity votes upon a Proposal when, during the Voting
      Period of that Proposal, e informs the Assessor of the vote or
      votes e is casting upon that Proposal, provided that e is
      authorized to vote on that Proposal. A Voting Entity may inform
      the Assessor that e casts no votes on a Proposal, and doing so
      cancels any votes e has previously cast on that Proposal, if
      this is done during the Voting Period of that Proposal.
      Cancelled votes are not counted by the Assessor and do not count
      towards Quorum.

      As soon as possible after the end of the Voting Period of a
      Proposal, the Assessor shall bill each Voting Entity one Voting
      Token for each uncancelled vote cast by that Voting Entity on
      that Proposal. In the case where a Voting Entity has cast more
      than one vote on a Proposal, or a Voting Entity has cast votes
      on more than one Proposal, the results of which the Assessor
      has published at the same time, the Assessor is permitted to
      bill the Voting Entity for an amount of Voting Tokens
      equivalent to all the uncancelled votes cast by the Voting
      Entity on those Proposals, instead of billing the Voting Entity
      once for each uncancelled vote e cast.

======================================================================
Style Points and the Wizard
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1542/4 (Power=1)
Style Points

      There are Entities known as Style Points.  All Players possess
      an integral number of Style Points that is positive, negative or
      zero.  The number of Style Points a Player has is that Player's
      Style. Any new Player, or a Player with no recorded Style
      Points, begins with a Style of zero.

      Each Player also has a High Style Mark.  Any new Player, or a
      Player with no recorded High Style Mark, begins with a High
      Style Mark of zero.

      Every time a Proposal is distributed, the Wizard has the option
      of changing the Style of the Player who submitted that Proposal,
      as long as that Player is not the Wizard.  The Wizard may only
      change the Style of Players whose Proposals were distributed
      after e became Wizard.

      The Wizard may add or subtract up to three Style Points from the
      Proposer's Style for any reason having to do with the form,
      content, effects, or nature of the Proposal-- but, for the
      change to have effect, such reasons must be included in eir
      Wizard's Report, as provided for in other Rules.

      Whenever a Player's Style points exceeds eir High Style Mark by
      two or more points, the Wizard shall pay out to that Player a
      reward of one P-Note for every two points in excess of eir
      current High Style Mark and eir High Style Mark shall be
      increased by two times the number of P-Notes awarded.

      A Player's Style and High Style Mark can only change as provided
      for in this Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1543/7 (Power=1)
The Wizard

      There is an Office of Wizard. The Official Report for the Office
      Wizard, or Wizard's Report, shall include:

         i) The Style of every Player.
        ii) The High Style Mark of every Player.
       iii) All Style changes, and the values of those changes, since
            the last Wizard's Report.
        iv) The change in Style, if any, merited by each Proposal
            distributed since the last Wizard's Report.
         v) The reasons for each change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1682/1 (Power=1)
Boors

      Let there exist the Patent Title of "Boor".

      Whenever a Player's Style becomes negative, that Player is
      automatically awarded the Patent Title of Boor.

      The Patent Title of Boor is revoked automatically from any
      Player whose Style becomes nonnegative.

      This Patent Title shall never be awarded or revoked by
      Directive.

      The Wizard shall announce in the Public Forum whenever a
      Player receives or loses this Title, as soon as possible
      after such award or revocation occurs.

======================================================================
Winning a Game
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 112/2 (Power=3)
Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      Ways for a Player to Win a Game may be defined by other Rules.
      Also, ways to prevent a Player from Winning a Game may be
      defined by other Rules. A Player Wins whenever a Win condition
      defined by one or more of those Rules occurs for that Player,
      provided that no Win-Preventing conditions are also occurring at
      that time for that Player.

      If no other Rule defining a way to Win exists, then a Player
      Wins upon each Winter and Summer Solstice, and upon each Vernal
      and Autumnal Equinox, with the Winner being chosen randomly by
      the Speaker from among all Voters not on Hold who are not
      ineligible to Win because of an applicable Win-preventing Rule.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1580/0 (Power=1)
Multiple Winners of a Single Game

      If two or more Players simultaneously achieve the same or
      different Win Conditions, all such Players Win the Game, except
      for those for which Win-Preventing Conditions are also true.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1498/3 (Power=1)
Winning by Blots

      A Player Wins the Game if e is the only Immaculate Player, and e
      has correctly reported this fact to the Public Forum, provided
      that e did not Win in this manner within the three months prior
      to this announcement.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1663/2 (Power=1)
Win by Proposals

      A Player Wins the Game if three Proposals submitted by em in a
      row receive exactly the same number of FOR, AGAINST and ABSTAIN
      Votes. The Assessor is prohibited from Winning in this manner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1622/2 (Power=1)
Forfeiting the Game

      Players shall be permitted to forfeit the current Game by
      sending a notification to that effect to the Public Forum.
      Forfeiting the current Game is a Win-preventing condition which
      prevails from the time of such notification until either some
      other Player has won the Game, or until three months have
      elapsed from the time of the notification, whichever comes
      first.

      Being the only Active Player who has not forfeited the current
      Game constitutes a Win condition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1697/0 (Power=1)
Multiple rapid wins prohibited

      Any Player who has Won twice within a given seven day period is
      prohibited from Winning again during that period.  This is a
      Win-Preventing condition for that Player.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1638/1 (Power=1)
Announcing a Win

      Whenever a Player is required to report that a Win has occurred,
      e shall do so by posting to the Public Forum the following
      information :
        i) The fact someone has won the Game
       ii) The date of the win, correct to within 36 hours
      iii) The cause of the win
       iv) The identity of the Player or Players who Won the Game

      Any communication pertaining to a Win shall be a legal and
      correct announcement of same if and only if it contains all
      required information.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 755/6 (Power=1)
Champions

      There is a class of Patent Titles known as Winners' Cups. There
      are 13 different Cups, ranked in ascending order, the full list
      of which is defined in this Rule.

      Whenever a Player Wins a Game, e shall be awarded the lowest
      Cup, if e has never been awarded a Cup previously; if e already
      is the holder of a Cup, e shall be awarded the Cup immediately
      above the one e already holds, if it exists. Any other Cups
      previously held shall be immediately revoked and lose any
      Historical Significance.

      The Cups are :
       * (1) Paper Cup, (2) Tin Cup, (3) Glass Cup, (4) Crystal Cup
       * (5) Bronze Cup, (6) Silver Cup, (7) Gold Cup, (8) Platinum
         Cup
       * (9) Amber Cup, (10) Ruby Cup, (11) Emerald Cup, (12) Diamond
         Cup
       * (13) Supreme Cup

      The first three groups are know, respectively, as the Plain
      Cups, the Noble Cups and the Extravagant Cups.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1465/10 (Power=1)
Champion's Reward

      At the start of the first Nomic Week after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, that Player shall
      receive a Champion's Reward.  The Champion's Reward shall last
      for four Nomic weeks from that time, and is then withdrawn from
      that Player.  As soon as possible after the legal and correct
      announcement that a Player has won a Game, the Registrar shall
      pay out ten Voting Tokens to that Player.

      Any Player who has been awarded a Champion's Reward that has
      not yet been withdrawn, has the right to cast three votes on
      any Proposal.

      The Registrar shall maintain a list of all Champion's Rewards
      which have been granted and have not yet been withdrawn,
      including to whom they have been granted, and their times of
      commencement and conclusion.  This list is known as the Green
      Pages, and is part of the Registrar's Report.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Scores
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1775/0 (Power=1)
Points and Scoring

      Every Player has associated with em specific numerical value
      known as their Score.  A Player's Score shall always be an
      integer.  If the rules specify a non-integral change in a
      Player's Score, that change shall be rounded to the nearest
      integer before being applied.

      Only a Player can have a Score.

      Changes in a Player's Score can be referred to as a gain or
      loss of Points.  A gain of some number of Points means that
      number is to be added to a Player's Score, a loss of some number
      of Points means that number is to be subtracted from a Player's
      Score.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules dealing with
      Points and Scoring.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1776/0 (Power=1)
the Scorekeepor

      There is an Office of Scorekeepor whose salary is twice the
      Basic Officer Salary.  The Scorekeepor shall keep and maintain
      a record of the current Scores of each Player.  The
      Scorekeepor's Official Report shall include the Scores of every
      player, the changes in those Scores since the last report, and
      the reasons for those changes.  E shall publish this report in
      the Public Forum at least once a week.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1782/1 (Power=1)
Changing a Player's Score

      A Player's Score is the Score reported by the Scorekeepor.  A
      Player's Score changes only when the Scorekeepor records the
      change.

      The Scorekeepor shall only record changes when a Player
      empowered by the Rules to order such a change so orders em.
      When the Scorekeepor is so ordered to make a change e must do so
      as soon as possible.

      A Player's score is correct when it reflects all changes
      mandated by the Rules and ordered by the appropriate Players.
      A Player's score is incorrect when it is in error, reflects
      changes that were not ordered as mandated by the Rules, or fails
      to reflect a change that was ordered as mandated by the Rules.

      A COE or CFJ can be issued alleging that a Player's score is
      incorrect.  If such a CFJ or COE finds that the Score was
      incorrect, then the Scorekeepor must order that Score to be
      changed to the correct Score. (If an erroneous order resulted in
      the incorrect score, this order counts as its reversal.  If an
      unapplied order resulted in the incorrect Score, this order
      counts as its application.  Such corrections shall not be
      applied twice.)

      If the Rules mandate a change in a Player's score, and do not
      both require and empower a Player to order that change, that
      change shall not be included in any determination of a correct
      Score.

      The effect of ratifying the Scorekeepor's report is to render
      all Scores listed in it as correct.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that attempts to
      specify a Player's Score.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1783/0 (Power=1)
Ordering Changes in a Player's Score

      When a Rule states that a Player's Score must change, and
      specifies a Player who is required to order this change, that
      Player then must order the Scorekeepor to make this change as
      soon as possible after the Rules mandate the change. This order
      shall be a message to the Scorekeepor naming the Player subject
      to the Score change, the reason for the change, and specifying
      the magnitude of that change.

      If a Player is required to order a change to the Score, then
      e is empowered to order it, but not necessarily vice versa.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1784/1 (Power=1)
The Omnibus Scoring Rule

      In any week that at least one Rule Change Proposed by a Player
      is adopted, that Player shall gain three Points.  The Rulekeepor
      must order this Score change.

      In any week where a Player Voted on more than three Proposals, e
      gains three Points. The Assessor must order this Score change.

      Whenever a Player wins an Election, e shall gain five Points.
      The Vote Collector for the Election must order this Score
      change.

      Whenever a Player becomes Speaker, e shall gain three Points.
      The Registrar must order this Score change.

      Whenever a Player gains three style points for a Proposal, e
      shall gain two Points.  The Wizard must order this Score change.

      Whenever a Player Judges a CFJ, e gains three Points.  The Clerk
      of the Courts must order this Score change.

      Whenever a Player gains a Blot, e shall lose two Points.  The
      Herald must order this Score change.

      In any week where a Player Voted in at least one referendum on
      an Internomic proposal, e gains one Point. The Ambassador must
      order this Score change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1777/0 (Power=1)
Winning Scores

      If any Player reaches a Score of 100 or more, then the Player
      who has the highest Score and no win-preventing conditions is
      Eligible to Win the game.  In the case of a tie for the highest
      such Score, all such Players are Eligible to Win.

      Whenever a Player becomes Eligible to Win the Scorekeepor must
      announce this event in the Public Forum as soon as possible.

      If no Endgame Procedure is underway at the time of this
      announcement, this announcement initiates an Endgame Procedure.

      If an Endgame Procedure is underway, and a Player becomes
      Eligible to Win (because of a loss of a win-preventing
      condition) this does not imply that any other Player loses an
      Eligibility to Win already granted by the Scorekeepor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1778/1 (Power=1)
Initiating an Endgame Procedure

      When the Scorekeepor announces that there is a Player Eligible
      to win, and there is no Endgame Procedure underway, then that
      announcement shall initiate an Endgame Procedure.

      During an Endgame Procedure no Score changes shall be applied to
      any Player.  All orders to change a Player's Score shall be
      deferred until the termination of the Endgame Procedure.  This
      rule takes precedence over Rules that would allow these changes
      to be applied during the Endgame Procedure.

      An Endgame Procedure shall persist until it is terminated by the
      Scorekeepor.

      An unchallenged Endgame Procedure shall be terminated as soon as
      it has been unchallenged for seven consecutive days, unless the
      Rules require an earlier termination.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1779/0 (Power=1)
Challenging an Endgame Procedure

      When the Scorekeepor initiates an Endgame Procedure it is
      initially unchallenged.

      An Endgame Procedure is challenged if any of the following
      occurs while it persists;

        i) A COE alleges an error in the Scorekeepor's announcement
           that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

       ii) A CFJ is being decided which alleges an error in the
           Scorekeepor's announcement that affects a Player's
           Eligibility to Win.

      iii) An Appeal of a CFJ is being decided where the matter at
           issue is an allegation of an error in the Scorekeepor's
           announcement that affects a Player's Eligibility to Win.

      If a challenge is resolved finding that no error existed, the
      Scorekeepor shall make an announcement stating that the Endgame
      Procedure is now unchallenged, the Endgame Procedure shall be
      terminated four days from this announcement, unless it is
      challenged again.

      If a challenge is resolved finding an error did exist, then all
      Players Eligible to Win cease to be Eligible to Win and the
      Endgame Procedure shall be immediately terminated without a
      winner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1780/0 (Power=1)
Losing Eligibility to Win

      During an Endgame Procedure, if Player who is Eligible to Win
      acquires a win-preventing condition, or ceases to be a Player, e
      ceases to be Eligible to Win.

      If at any time during an Endgame Procedure there is no Player
      Eligible to Win, the Procedure shall immediately terminate
      without a winner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1781/0 (Power=1)
Termination of the Endgame Procedure

      Whenever the Rules call for the termination of an Endgame
      Procedure, the Scorekeepor shall announce this fact in the
      Public Forum as soon as possible after it occurs.  Upon the
      Scorekeepor's announcement, the Endgame Procedure shall
      conclude with the following effects, in order;

        i) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame
           Procedure, and there are still Players Eligible to Win,
           then all Players' Scores shall be set to zero.  The
           Scorekeepor must order this change.

       ii) If there was no successful challenge to the Endgame
           Procedure, and there are still Players Eligible to Win,
           then those Players Win.  All such Players then cease to be
           Eligible to Win.

      iii) All score changes that were suspended during the Endgame
           Procedure shall be applied.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Indulgences and Blots
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1435/4 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate

      Indulgences are a Currency.  The MUQ of Indulgences is 1.
      The Recordkeepor for Indulgences is the Herald.  The Mintor of
      Indulgences is the Bank.

      The Herald's Report includes the number of Indulgences possessed
      by each entity which possesses them, and the changes thereof
      since the last posting of the Herald's Report.

      A Payment Order for a number of Indulgences, the payee of which
      is the Bank, is known as that number of Blots.  When a Rule
      states that a Player is to gain some number of Blots, a Payment
      Order shall be executed with that Player as the payor, the Bank
      as the payee, and for a number of Indulgences equal to the
      number of Blots that Player is to receive.  This order is to be
      executed by whomever is required to report the change in Blots.

      A Player may be said to have a number of Blots equal to the sum
      of the amounts of all Payment Orders for Indulgences naming em
      as the payor and the Bank as payee, including orders which are
      disputed (but not those which have been vacated).  A Player with
      no such Payment Orders is Immaculate.  It is a Win-Preventing
      condition for a Player to have one or more Blots.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1712/4 (Power=1)
Distribution of Indulgences

      At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Herald shall randomly
      distribute a number of Indulgences equal to the number of Blots
      executed in the past Week, less the number of Blots vacated in
      the past Week, among all Players: for each such Indulgence, the
      Herald shall randomly select one Player and issue a Payment
      Order from the Bank to that Player for one Indulgence.  If this
      number is negative, no distribution occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1714/2 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      An Overdue Payment Order that is a number of Blots is that
      number of Overdue Blots.  A Lawless Player is a Player who has
      more than 30 Overdue Blots.

      Whenever a Player correctly alleges in the Public Forum that
      another Player is Lawless, the Lawless Player is removed from
      any Offices e holds, deregistered, and cannot reregister until a
      month has passed.

      If the Lawless Player was the Speaker, the Speaker-Elect first
      immediately becomes Speaker, and the old Speaker ceases to be
      Speaker.

      To incorrectly allege in the Public Forum that a Player is
      Lawless is the Crime of Persecution, a Class A Crime.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would prohibit a
      Lawless Player from being deregistered, or which would allow em
      to reregister.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1747/0 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players.
      The Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic
      month, and may not Pardon the same Player twice in a given term
      of office (although, if re-elected later, he may again Pardon
      that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Player by
      announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
      following events may occur:

        1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to
           eliminate all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player,
           and the Herald shall do so as soon as possible.

        2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any
           Payment Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned
           Player's estate in order to reduce the number of Blots
           possessed by the Player's estate to below the threshhold
           for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for
           X number of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser
           number of Indulgences would suffice to render the Player no
           longer Lawless.

        3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player
           may immediately reregister.

        4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
           Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a
           list of up to ten Prescribed Words in his Pardon.

        5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
           penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during
           this period he must apply all Indulgences received (from
           any source) to his debt and may not transfer them to
           another Entity.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or
      Persistent Indebtedness.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1439/5 (Power=1)
Blots Due to a CFJ

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has
      violated a specific Rule is found to be TRUE, the Player
      receives Blots equal to the Power of the violated Rule rounded
      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four.  This Rule defers to the wording of the
      violated Rule when it defines a Blot penalty in the specific
      case of a CFJ, or specifically forbids Blot penalties in the
      case of a CFJ.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ has the Legal
      Responsibility to report Blots due to the CFJ to the Herald

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the
      Player who received Blots shall lose the same number of
      Blots as were given due to the initial Judgement of the
      CFJ.  The Player losing the Blots has responsibility for
      reporting that loss to the Herald.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1437/3 (Power=1)
Fugitives from Justice

      When an Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice, and e receives
      Fugitive Blots equal to the number of Blots e then had.  The
      Herald shall keep a record of the number of Fugitive Blots
      attributed to each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to each Fugitive of Justice,
      rounding down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have the
      number of Fugitive Blots attributed to em reduced to less than
      one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, the Herald shall
      assess against em a number of Blots equal to the number of
      Fugitive Blots attributed to em at the time of eir
      reregistration.  Eir Fugitive Blots are then removed.

======================================================================
Changing Speakers
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1647/2 (Power=1)
Office of the Speaker-Elect

      Let there be the Office of Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker-Elect has
      the duty to be the Speaker's successor.  Whenever a
      Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker-Elect.
      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

      The CotC and Justiciar may not Nominate for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be held temporarily by a
      Player because of the Speaker-Elect becoming Speaker(or for any
      other reason,) the Office is filled according to the Order of
      Succession, as defined by other Rules, with the Speaker as
      Arbiter of Succession.

      The Speaker-Elect receives no salary for filling the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.

      This rule takes precedence over all other Rules defining the
      characteristics of the Office of Speaker-Elect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1648/3 (Power=1)
When the Speaker is Tainted

      If the Rules require that a Speaker Transition occur, and
      the Office of Speaker-Elect is not being held in the normal
      fashion at that time, then the Transition proceeds as set
      out in other Rules, but the new Speaker is Tainted.

      A Tainted Speaker may remain Speaker only until some other
      Player holds the Office of Speaker-Elect in normal fashion, at
      which point, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1658/0 (Power=1)
Tainting the Speaker

      A Speaker shall become Tainted when a Referendum calling for the
      Tainting of the Speaker passes. Any Active Player is permitted
      to call such a Referendum at any time, by requesting such to the
      Public Forum.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Registrar, Voting
      Entities do not include the Speaker, and its Adoption Ratio is
      2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 681/9 (Power=1)
Giving Up Speakership

      If the Speaker announces in the Public Forum that e is giving
      up the Speakership voluntarily, a Speaker Transition occurs.

      As soon as possible after the Transition is completed, the
      new Speaker shall bill the former Speaker one Voting Token.

      When a Speaker voluntarily gives up the Speakership in this
      manner, e is prevented from nominating emself for the Office of
      Speaker-Elect for a period lasting two weeks, or until the
      start of the next quarter, whichever is longest.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1375/6 (Power=1)
Speaker Going On Hold

      A Speaker who goes On Hold while e is still Speaker commits the
      Crime of Speaker Inactivity, a Class B Crime.

      If the Speaker is On Hold, a Speaker Transition occurs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 786/6 (Power=1)
Rule of Succession for Speaker or Speaker-Elect

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled temporarily
      according to the Order of Succession, that order is defined to
      be:

      the Promotor
      the Assessor
      the Justiciar
      the Clerk of the Courts
      the Rulekeepor
      the Registrar
      the Archivist
      all Officers in order of most recent registration
      all Active Players in order of most recent registration

      except that the Speaker does not appear in the Order.  The Order
      of Succession is determined at the time the Office is to be
      filled.

      Any Rule which requires the Office of Speaker-Elect to be filled
      according to the Order of Succession must specify an Arbiter
      of Succession; if it does not, the Speaker-Elect shall not be
      chosen according to that Rule. This Rule takes precedence over
      such Rules.  (If this would ever result in the Speaker filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, then the Speaker-Elect shall
      instead be filled by the Order of Succession, with the Speaker
      as Arbiter of Succession.)

      When the Office of Speaker-Elect is to be filled, the Arbiter of
      Succession shall, as soon as possible, announce in the Public
      Forum that the Office of Speaker-Elect is being temporarily
      filled by this Rule.  Once this announcement has been made, each
      Player has three days to decline to fill the Office by sending a
      message to the Arbiter stating e does so.

      During this three day period, the Office of Speaker-Elect is
      held by that Active Player highest in the order of succession
      who has not yet declined to the Arbiter.  If there is only one
      Active Player in the order of succession who has not declined,
      that Player may not decline.

      At the end of the three days, the Office is filled by the Active
      Player highest on the list of succession who did not decline the
      Office, and that player may no longer decline.

      As soon as possible after, and within four days of, the filling
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Arbiter of Succession shall
      announce which Active Player is now the Speaker-Elect.

      Announcements by the Arbiter have no effect on the identity of
      the Speaker-Elect.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 402/6 (Power=1)
Speaker Transition

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time
      the Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which
      proceeds as follows:

      (i) when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
      all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a result
      of being Speaker;

      (ii) as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
      commences, the Registrar shall post to the Public Forum a
      Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the reason for the
      Transition and the Player who held the Office of Speaker-Elect
      at the time the Transition commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
      correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
      causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
      Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
      the process of Speaker Transition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1581/3 (Power=1)
Quarterly Speaker Change

      A Speaker Transition occurs upon the commencement of each
      new quarter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Subordinate Legal Codes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under
      the Rules.  A body of law is a SLC only if it is granted that
      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the
      Rules for being a SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1595/0 (Power=1)
Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence
      for the components, if any, within a given SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1594/0 (Power=1)
Violation of SLCs

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of three Blots, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1457/10 (Power=1)
Judicial Procedure for Violations of an SLC

      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If, any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1590/1 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      Compact between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1589/2 (Power=1)
Modification of SLCs

      A SLC shall not be changed except in accordance with the Rules.
      Notwithstanding any other method which may be defined, a SLC may
      always be changed by the operation of an instrument of Power 1
      or greater.

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1592/0 (Power=1)
Authority of SLCs to Change Properties

      A SLC has the power to define the manner in which certain
      properties of entities are changed.  This power shall be limited
      to any property solely defined by that SLC and to any other
      property to which the Rules grant that SLC this authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



======================================================================
Organizations
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1528/4 (Power=1)
Organizations

      There are entities known as Organizations.  An entity is only an
      Organization when specifically designated as such by the Rules.
      All Organizations consist of the following elements;

        i) An associated SLC.
       ii) A set of Players under the Jurisdiction of the associated
           SLC.
      iii) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

      No Organization exists that is not of a class of Organization
      that is defined in the Rules. The class of an Organization is
      specified when it is formed, and can not change thereafter.  If
      a class of Organization ever becomes undefined in the Rules,
      then all Organizations of that class are immediately dissolved.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1614/1 (Power=1)
Organizations' Names

      The Name of all Organizations shall be unique. No action is
      permitted that would allow either a nameless Organization to
      exist, or a Organization to exist with a Name that duplicates
      that of another Nomic Entity.

      The Name of an Organization shall only be changed as specified
      by its SLC, or as specified in the Rules. If no other procedure
      is specified, the Name of any Organization shall change with the
      unanimous consent of all Players within the Jurisdiction of that
      Organization's SLC.

      This Rule defers to Rules pertaining to a specific class of
      Organization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1612/1 (Power=1)
Organizations' SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified in an Organization's SLC, that SLC
      can be changed by the unanimous consent of all the Players
      within the SLCs Jurisdiction.

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC is permitted to vary
      over the period of its existence. The SLC of an Organization
      ceases to exist when the Organization ceases to exist.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1531/4 (Power=1)
Administrators and Their Duties

      The Administrator of an Organization shall be within the
      Jurisdiction of that Organization's Compact, be the Maintainer
      of the Organizations SLC, and be the Executor of that
      Organization.

      The Administrator shall inform the Notary of the following
      changes as soon as possible after they occur, and identify the
      nature of the change;

        i) The Name of the Organization changes.
       ii) The Administrator of the Organization changes.
      iii) The Executor of the Organization changes.
       iv) The Maintainer if the Organization's SLC changes.
        v) The Jurisdiction of the Organization's SLC changes.
       vi) The Organization undergoes a Voluntary Dissolution.

      The Administrator also shall be the Player required to maintain
      a record of the Players within the Jurisdiction of the
      Organization's SLC.

      This Rule shall defer to the Rules governing specific classes of
      Organizations if they specify differently.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1630/2 (Power=1)
Impersonation

      Any Player who knowingly attempts to act as, or purports to be,
      the Executor of an Entity, of which e is not the Executor,
      commits the Crime of Impersonation, a Class C Crime.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1547/5 (Power=1)
Some Organizations Can Vote

      If an Organization is a Voting Entity then it is permitted to
      cast votes on Proposals as if it were a Player. Such votes are
      cast by the Organization's Executor, acting on behalf of the
      Organization.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1759/0 (Power=1)
Organizational Payment Orders

      The Executor of Organization's SLC is empowered to execute
      Payment Orders from the Organization or from any Player within
      its Jurisdiction, but only such Payment Orders as are authorized
      by the SLC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1533/9 (Power=1)
Application to Create an Organization

      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create
      an Organization (ACO).  A valid ACO, in order to have effect
      upon Execution, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      An valid ACO is Executed by submitting it to the Notary or by
      being sent to the Public Forum.

      The effect of Executing a valid ACO is to create the prospective
      Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.  The
      Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that Organization's
      SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be Executed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1397/5 (Power=1)
Dissolution of Organizations

      An Organization shall only be dissolved when the Rules or the
      Organization's SLC require it.  An Organization shall be
      required to be dissolved whenever any of the following
      conditions are true:

        i) The Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is no
           provision for this to change.
       ii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Administrator.
      iii) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Executor.
       iv) The continued existence of the Organization would require
           that the Organization have no legal Maintainer for its SLC.
        v) The SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
           dissolve.  This is a Voluntary Dissolution, all other
           dissolutions are Administrative Dissolutions.

      The Notary is required to detect when an Administrative
      Dissolution takes place.

      As soon as possible after an Organization dissolves, for any
      reason, the Notary shall report that dissolution to the Public
      Forum.

      All Organizations cease to exist upon dissolution. Other Rules
      can require an Organization to dissolve under other
      circumstances.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1617/1 (Power=1)
Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC shall only be changed
      in accordance with that SLC and with the Rules.  If there are no
      provisions for changing such an SLC, then the SLC can not be
      changed.

      No Player shall ever be made part of the Jurisdiction of the SLC
      of any Organization without eir consent.  This takes precedence
      over any Rule that would permit a Player to be involuntarily
      made part of the Jurisdiction of such a SLC.

======================================================================
The Notary
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1458/6 (Power=1)

Groups and Contests
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 766/9 (Power=1)
Groups

      There is a class of Organization known collectively as the class
      of Groups.  Each single Organization within this class is a
      Group.  Each Group has associated with it an SLC called its
      Ordinances.  A Group's Administrator is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor.  A Group's Executor is that Group's Vizier. The
      set of Players within the Jurisdiction of that Group's SLC is
      that Group's Membership.

      A Group's Membership is permitted to contain any Player who is
      not a Member of any other Group.

      A Group must have at least three Foundors, who constitute the
      Group's initial Membership.  Both the Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group.

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 716/6 (Power=1)
How to Form a Group

      An ACO that attempts to form a Group must contain, in addition
      to any information required elsewhere, a specification of the
      prospective initial Ordinancekeepor and Vizier of the Group to
      be created.  Further, an Application to Create a Group is
      invalid, and has no effect if Executed, if any of its
      signatories is a Member of another Group at the time of its
      Execution.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 719/2 (Power=1)
Joining a Group

      b) the Player to be added has sent the Vizier of the Group in
         question a message requesting to be added to the Membership
         of that Group; and
      c) the addition of that Player to that Group's Membership is
         otherwise permitted by that Group's Ordinances and the Rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 721/8 (Power=1)
The Vizier and the Ordinanacekeepor

      The Vizier of a Group shall be whoever the Ordinances of that
      Group specify. If the Ordinances are silent, the Vizier shall be
      the Player who authored the ACO that created that Group, if e is
      still a Member of that Group.  If the Group was not created by
      the Execution of a ACO, the Vizier shall be whoever was the
      Vizier of that Group when it was first created.

      If the Vizier thus specified is not a Member of the Group, the
      Group shall be dissolved.

      Unless the Ordinances of a Group specify otherwise, the
      Ordinancekeepor of a Group shall be its Vizier.

      Any Player is permitted to be a Contestant or a Contestmaster of
      any Contest, unless that would conflict with that Contest's

      conflict with the Rules.

      The Regulations can specify the following:

        i) How a Contestmaster is replaced. No person may become

           the Contestmaster cannot change while the Contest exists.
       ii) How the Currencies in the Contest Fund shall be spent.  If
           this is not specified, they may only be spent when the
           Rules require it.
      iii) The amount of the Entry Fee for the Contest, in the form of
           units of any specific Currency.
       iv) Additional restrictions on Players to become Contestants,
           and conditions under which Contestants cease to be
           Contestants.

      A Player becomes a Contestant by notifying the Contestmaster and
      paying the prescribed Entry Fee to the Contest Fund.  A
      Contestant may quit a Contest at any time by so notifying the
      Contestmaster.  A Contestmaster may resign at any time by
      posting a message to that effect to the Public Forum, at which
      time e ceases to be Contestmaster.

      The Patent Title of Shogun is revoked automatically from any
      Player who holds it if e ceases to be a Samurai.

      specified in this Rule; this Rule takes precedence over any Rule
      which would permit otherwise.
