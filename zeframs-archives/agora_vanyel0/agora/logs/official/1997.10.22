======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments: 
 
At least when there are some VTs in the Bank, they'll have someplace 
to go - judicial salaries, y'know : -)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I dismiss this on the grounds that I feel like it.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

In the Appeal of CFJ 1014 I hereby rule that Chuck's decision
was incorrect, insofar as he did not legally dismiss the CFJ 
in accordance with the requirements of R1565, for one of the 
reasons set out therein.

Now, it is obvious to all that the decision to dismiss is, in
and of itself, the correct one. What we have here is a case
of the right Judgement illegally submitted. Personally, had
I been the CotC, I probably would have rejected the Judgement
as illegal, listed Chuck as having defaulted, and re-assigned
the CFJ to a new Judge. But the CotC did accept the Judgement
as legally submitted, and I am not inclined to press the point.
Instead, I wish to consider what precedent to set for future
Justices faced with the Appeal of an illegally made Judgement.
It seems to me that the best course, as a matter of principle,
is re-assignment, and so I hereby order that the CFJ be re-assigned
to a new Judge.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

I sympathize with the Judge, but he erred in dismissing without giving a
legal reason as prescribed in Rule 1565.  In the words of Rule 1694, the
dismissal was not "properly made."

There is no need for the Board to recommend a specific action. If the Board
finds the dismissal was not properly made, the CFJ is to be reassigned by
the CotC.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

Looking back at the case I agree with my fellow Justices. The Dismissal
was not properly made, as no legal reasons was given for the Dismissal.

(Caller's) Arguments:

Arguments: R1478 says that "The Executor of an entity is a Player who 
is empowered by the Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e 
was that entity. Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player 
is eir own Executor." I argue that this should properly be read
to define any Player who can act on behalf of an entity as that
entity's Executor. Since, on October 14, Antimatter was not his
own executor, he could not act on his own behalf and thus his attempt
to transfer a Kudo failed.

Relevant Rules: R1478.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

You would prefer that I ignore the obvious and direct meaning as
being a Transfer Order for 4 VTs in favor of the less obvious,
indirect meaning as being 2 Transfer Orders for 2 VTs each? 
Please. COE denied.  Further, I transfer one Kudo from Morendil for
making such a baseless COE, to Harlequin, for being the unfortunate
victim of circumstance. 

For one thing, that is precisely what I expect you to do - the Courts
have been working overtime to establish that implicit specifications
in the wording of Orders were to be given due consideration, and
Harlequin's request for a transfer is worded so that it was well
within your authority, given this judicial basis, to interpret it as
two successful distinct TOs. Note that Harlequin's request did not
purport to be one TO for 4 VTs, but merely requested that you note a
Transfer or Transfers for a total of 4 VTs; given that the POs this
aimed to satisfy were explicitly listed, your contention that the
'obvious and direct' intent was as a TO for an amount of 4 VTs
simply makes no sense.

For another thing, "unfortunate victim of circumstance", together
with your statement that "The Bank gratefully appreciates your
donation", strikes me as very cynical.

I'll let the Agoran community take appropriate steps, if they so
wish, to compensate for the injurious Kudo transfer above; however,
your behaviour as an Officer should be subject to formal scrutiny
and I therefore submit the following CFJ :

===
General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.
===

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

This Judge finds that, in stating that Harlequin's message "I transfer
4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041" failed to satisfy
payment orders VT1040 and VT1041, and then denying a COE asserting the
opposite, General Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE denial.

As the caller of the CFJ claims, it is legitimate to interpret
statements such as Harlequin's generously, to wit that the transfer
made be considered two separate Transfer Orders, one for each of the
two Payment Orders he was required to satisfy. 

This is in line with recent judicial (and appelate) decisions which
allow Transfer and Payment Orders to be made implicitly, and
represents a welcome shift towards a less pedantic style of play.

Michael.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Speaker:

I hereby reverse Michael's Judgement and find that the Statement is
FALSE.

Although I completely agree with Michael's reasoning concerning how
Harlequin's message should have been interpreted, the fact is that
Michael's Judgement was made without reference to the possibility
that Harlequin's attempts to transfer VTs might have failed to
satisfy any Payment Orders simply because Harlequin, like every other
Player, had no VTs at the time, a consequence of the destruction of
Voting Tokens by P3533.

I am not aware of any other occasion on which General Chaos has
wrongfully denied a COE, so I conclude that the Statement, despite
its generality, is FALSE.

Speaker Steve

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Justiciar:

FALSE (overturning the original Judgement)

General Chaos is being too picky here, but the question is, should the COE
have been admitted?  Morendil's claim essentially says that Harlequin's
Transfer Orders of 20 September did satisfy the indicated Payment Orders,
when the General said they did not.

According to Rule 1732, a PO can only be satisfied when the appropriate TO
is successfully executed and the amount named is correct.  According to
Rule 1598, this could only happen if Harlequin had enough VTs.  As CFJ 933
has established, on 20 September nobody had any VTs.  Thus the TOs could
not have satisfied the POs, as claimed (though for reasons other than the
ones given).

In my reading of Rule 1431, the essence of the response to a COE is the
denial or acceptance (and in the latter case, posting of the corrected
portion of the report).  Rule 1431 does _not_ require the respondent to
post reasons and arguments.

Therefore, denying a claim for the wrong reason does not constitute
Wrongful COE Denial, if the claim should have been denied for other
reasons.  This is mostly a good thing; for an Officer it should be enough
to get the decision right, without having to make sure the reasons are
perfect too.

Thus I vote to overturn the judgement, and rule that the CFJ should be
judged FALSE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning CotC:

In the case of CFJ 1047 I UPHOLD the Judgement of TRUE.

It has been argued by some, notably General Chaos, that the COE
that Morendil made was rightfully denied, as Harlequin did not
actually transfer 4 VTs to the Bank, so e did also not actually
satisfy the Payment Orders. However, what does the post in question
of General Chaos actually say? General Chaos writes:

  Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
  VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.

  The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

Thus, in my opinion, General Chaos does not only claim that the
POs are not satisfied, but he also claims that transferring 4 VTs
to the Bank would not satisfy them. Which, as the Judge has, in my
opinion rightly, decided, is not the case. Thus the message was in
fact misrepenting the Gamestate in that it misrepresented the effect
transferring 4 VTs to the Bank would have been able to have, had it 
actually taken place.

By the way, have the other Justices really checked all of General
Chaos's other denied COE's to check whether he did not happen to
commit the Crime on some other time...? If not they would have done
better to dismiss the CFJ than to have changed the Judgement to
FALSE.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning second Judge:

After reviewing all of the evidence, one point sticks out that simply
cannot be ignored.  Justice Andre argued that General Chaos claimed that
transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or VT1041,
both POs being for the amount of 2VTs each.  This statement misrepresents
the actual game state.  By denying the COE which alleged as such, General
Chaos committed the Crime of Wrongful COE Denial, a class 1 crime which
bears a penalty of 1 Blot.

I hereby find this CFJ to be TRUE.

Since this CFJ was reassigned, Michael's original Injunction had no effect.

I hereby issue an Injunction requiring the Clerk of the Courts to execute
whatever Payment Orders are necessary to penalize General Chaos for this
Crime. 

======================================================================

Evidence (added by CotC):

piece 1: message of General Chaos to agora-business, dated 28 September
piece 2: message of Morendil to agora-business, dated 28 September

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidence 1:

----------------------------------------

"Chaos" == Chaos Harlequin <harlequin@tmbg.org> writes:

Chaos> I transfer 4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041.

Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.

The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Evidence 2:

----------------------------------------

> Chaos> I transfer 4 VTs to the Bank, to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041.
> 
> Transferring 4 VTs to the Bank fails to satisfy either of VT1040 or
> VT1041; both POs are for the amount of 2 VTs.
> 
> The Bank gratefully appreciates your donation, however.

This strikes me as extremely ridiculous - insofar as the above can
reasonably be interpreted as two TOs of 2 VTs each, satisfying one
of the named POs each, in the spirit of the Appeals Court's decision
on CFJ 940, I fail to see why there should be any difficulty in
accepting that these TOs satisfy the named POs.

I quote from the Speaker's decision in that matter :

   All that need be required is that the message be clearly identifiable
   as conveying a Payment Order, and that all of the elements of the
   Payment Order thus conveyed be determinable with reasonable
   certainty, either from being explicitly stated within that message,
   or reasonably deducible from the context in which that message was
   sent.

I see no reason why any of the above should not apply equally well to 
Transfer Orders. Please note that this is a COE.

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 663 permits an Injunction to apply more than one Player.
Therefore it is consistent to read the message in the relevant
Judgement as issuing 4 Injunctions. That the statement of the
Injunctions themselves refers to 'Injunctions' rather than 'an
Injunction' may be considered irrelevant under 754; further, Rule
663 requires that *each* Injunction should specify the Player or
Players to which it applies; thus, this reading is rendered necessary 
as well as legal by Rule 663; for multiple Injunctions to exist, 
mutliple specifications should exist, whereas "all current Officers" 
is merely one specification.

I bar Andre, Steve and elJefe. (The reason for doing so is that as
Justices in the relevant Board of Appeals, each Player named seems
to have already formed a conclusion as to this issue, which
conclusion was not part of what that Board was to consider - it seems
prudent, therefore, to leave a final decision in the hands of Players
who cannot be considered biased.)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

The heart of this judgement clearly lies in counting the number of
Injunctions made by Morendil in CFJ 1045.  Let us do that.

Let us begin by looking at Morendil's first sentence/paragraph containing
at least one Injunction:

---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

There are a few things to consider when trying to determine how many
Injunctions lie in this sentence.  First of all, the word "injunctions" is
used in its plural form.  This implies that there's more than one.
Morendil follows this word, however, with the phrase "applying to all
current Officers".  Therefore, he is making the statement "I hereby issue
Injunctions ..., applying to all current Officers, requiring them ... [to
issue one PO from the Bank to each player]"  Was the word "Injunctions"
used to imply there are more than one, or was it used to imply that there
were more than one Order?

Rule 663 states (in part):

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, the phrases "applying to all current Officers" states the target
of the Injunction(s), and the phrase "requiring them ..." to the end of the
sentence states what the targets are required to perform.  Nowhere in the
sentence/paragraph are further "injunctions" defined.  The first paragraph
therefore contains one injunction.

The second sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can be analyzed exactly as above.  It, also,
contains only one injunction.

The third sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can also be analyzed exactly as above.  It
therefore contains only one injunction.

The last sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)
---

This sentence/paragraph is exactly like the above, only it applies only to
the Registrar, and not all current Officers.

Counting up the total injunctions, I see only four.

The CFJ states that some or all of Andre's PO's of Oct 11 were issued
illegally, as there were no more than four injunctions.

I hereby find CFJ 1055 to be TRUE.

I hereby, as described and permitted by Rule 663, issue an Injunction
applying to Andre requiring em to vacate the Payment Orders POI101 through
POI124, inclusive.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning pro-Justiciar:

Decision of pro-Justiciar Zefram: OVERTURN/reverse

Others have already established that the decision of this CFJ depends
primarily on the number of Injunctions issued by Morendil in CFJ 1045,
which in turn depends on the interpretation of the wording e used in
issuing the Injunctions.  Let us examine this.  The first paragraph:

|I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
|applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
|Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
|Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
|Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
|far executed and have not been satisfied.

The form here is "I hereby issue Injunctions ... applying to all current
Officers, requiring them to ... for every Player, ...".  The use of
the plural "Injunctions" very strongly suggests that there is more than
one Injunction: in normal English usage, the unadorned plural can never
be correctly applied to a singular object.  The correct interpretation
must be consistent with normal English usage, unless there is no such
interpretation.

This form of words is, of course, ambiguous.  Excepting the possibility
that the paragraph is a single Injunction, there are three reasonable
interpretations.  One is that there is one Injunction per Officer, the
interpretation used by Andre.  This is a slightly awkward interpretation;
it requires that "applying to all current Officers" be taken to iterate
through the Officers.

The second possibility is that there is one Injunction per Player.
The form used is then "I hereby issue Injunctions ... for every Player,
...", which, although not perfect English ("each" would be more natural
than "every"), is a normal means of expressing iteration.  The content
of the first ellipsis, "applying to all current Officers, requiring
them to issue,", reads quite naturally as describing properties of
the Injunctions.  Although this interpretation means that the sentence
contains two interleaved phrases ("I hereby issue Injunctions for every
Player" and "applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue
a Payment Order ..."), this is entirely reasonable and clear.

The third possibility is that there is one Injunction per {Officer,
Player} pair.  In this interpretation, both "applying to all current
Officers" and "for every Player" are taken as iterative constructs.
The notes about the unnaturalness of the first interpretation also apply
here.  However, this interpretation is more natural than the first,
in that the final clause, "to issue ... a Payment Order ...", being
singular, fits naturally with the rest of the sentence, not requiring
any implicit iteration.

I choose not to decide which of these three interpretations is the best,
as that is not required in order to decide this CFJ, except in that I
find each to be prefereable to the interpretation as a single Injunction.
However, I do prefer the second and third interpretations to the first
-- and both of these would result in more Infractions than Andre issued
Payment Orders for.

The second and third of Morendil's paragraphs each have identical form
to the first, and the same arguments apply.  The fourth is different:

|I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
|applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
|Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
|amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

Here, interpreting "applying to the Registrar" as iterative would be
highly unnatural, as it is singular, and the corresponding pronoun, "em",
is also singular.  The only iterative construct is "for each Player".
This interpretation -- one Injunction per Player -- makes the entire
sentence read as natural English, albeit with a little more interleaving
than is usual.  This interpretation is, as before (but more so), vastly
preferable to the singular interpretation.

I therefore find that there were more Injunctions than Andre issued
Payment Orders for.  There were, unquestionably, more than the four
Injunctions to which the Statement refers.

Finally, observe part of the Statement:

|                          the number of Infractions allegedly
|committed by Judge Morendil in issuing Injunctions in eir Judgement
|of CFJ 1045 did not exceed 4,

The number of Infractions *allegedly* committed most certainly exceeds 4.
It was alleged at one point that Morendil committed 44 Infractions.
On this point alone, the Statement could reasonably be Judged FALSE,
regardless of the number of Infractions actually committed.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning pro-CotC:

Decision of pro-CotC Crito: OVERTURN/reverse

Again, the decision depends on the actual number of Injunctions that Morendil's
statements describe.  I have noticed one interpretation that seems to be
inescapable upon close reading of Morendil's statements.

"I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,..."

Quoting from R1736:

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  

I note that an Injunction of the sort described in Rule 1736 is an Injuction
for the execution of exactly one Payment Order.

Therefore, the use of the plural and the reference to R1736 leads me to the
conclusion that Morendil's statements must be interpreted as issuing one
Injunction for each Payment Order to be executed, whatever eir intention.  So,
how many is this?  For the fourth statement, it is clearly 21 Payment Orders
(one for each Player registered at that time).  For the first statement, it
works out to 12 different Payment Orders.  Already we have exceeded the 28
instances of Wrongful Injunction Infractions handed out by CotC Andre. 
Therefore, I must conclude that both clauses of the statement of CFJ 1055 are
FALSE and so do hereby order that Vir's original Judgement be overturned.

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning pro-Speaker:

Decision of pro-Speaker Murphy:  OVERTURN/reverse

I agree with all of the various arguments already expressed in the Public
Forum by the decisions of my fellow Justices, and do not see any pressing
reason to reiterate said arguments.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

========================================

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 663 permits an Injunction to apply more than one Player.
Therefore it is consistent to read the message in the relevant
Judgement as issuing 4 Injunctions. That the statement of the
Injunctions themselves refers to 'Injunctions' rather than 'an
Injunction' may be considered irrelevant under 754; further, Rule
663 requires that *each* Injunction should specify the Player or
Players to which it applies; thus, this reading is rendered necessary 
as well as legal by Rule 663; for multiple Injunctions to exist, 
mutliple specifications should exist, whereas "all current Officers" 
is merely one specification.

I bar Andre, Steve and elJefe. (The reason for doing so is that as
Justices in the relevant Board of Appeals, each Player named seems
to have already formed a conclusion as to this issue, which
conclusion was not part of what that Board was to consider - it seems
prudent, therefore, to leave a final decision in the hands of Players
who cannot be considered biased.)

======================================================================

Decision & Reasoning Judge:

The heart of this judgement clearly lies in counting the number of
Injunctions made by Morendil in CFJ 1045.  Let us do that.

Let us begin by looking at Morendil's first sentence/paragraph containing
at least one Injunction:

---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

There are a few things to consider when trying to determine how many
Injunctions lie in this sentence.  First of all, the word "injunctions" is
used in its plural form.  This implies that there's more than one.
Morendil follows this word, however, with the phrase "applying to all
current Officers".  Therefore, he is making the statement "I hereby issue
Injunctions ..., applying to all current Officers, requiring them ... [to
issue one PO from the Bank to each player]"  Was the word "Injunctions"
used to imply there are more than one, or was it used to imply that there
were more than one Order?

Rule 663 states (in part):

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

Therefore, the phrases "applying to all current Officers" states the target
of the Injunction(s), and the phrase "requiring them ..." to the end of the
sentence states what the targets are required to perform.  Nowhere in the
sentence/paragraph are further "injunctions" defined.  The first paragraph
therefore contains one injunction.

The second sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can be analyzed exactly as above.  It, also,
contains only one injunction.

The third sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.
---

This sentence/paragraph can also be analyzed exactly as above.  It
therefore contains only one injunction.

The last sentence/paragraph reads:
---
I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)
---

This sentence/paragraph is exactly like the above, only it applies only to
the Registrar, and not all current Officers.

Counting up the total injunctions, I see only four.

The CFJ states that some or all of Andre's PO's of Oct 11 were issued
illegally, as there were no more than four injunctions.

I hereby find CFJ 1055 to be TRUE.

I hereby, as described and permitted by Rule 663, issue an Injunction
applying to Andre requiring em to vacate the Payment Orders POI101 through
POI124, inclusive.

Rule 663/6 (Power=1)
Injunctions--General

      A Judge is permitted to issue orders requiring one or more
      Players to perform, or refrain from performing, one or more
      actions.  Such an order is called an Injunction.

       To be legally made, an Injunction must:

        i) Specify the Player(s) to whom it applies.
       ii) Specify the action(s) the Player(s) are required to perform
           or refrain from performing.
      iii) Either be attached to a legally made Judgement at the time
           that Judgement is originally delivered to the Cotc, or be
           legally made by the Board of Appeals in an Appeal of an
           Injunction.
       iv) Be of a type explicitly defined in the Rules.
        v) Be issued in a manner consistent with the Rules.

      An Injunction which does not meet these criteria has no effect.

========================================

Judge's Decision & Reasoning in 1045:

In CFJ 1045, I find the Statement to be TRUE.

I am in essential agreement with the Caller that Rule 1563 provides
more than adequate justification for Dismissing the named CFJs, in
spite of some arduous wording which made it briefly tempting - given
the rewards of returning a Judgement on, rather than Dismiss, these
CFJs - to wriggle my way out of it.


But wait, there is more.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they have thus
far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Indulgences equal to the sum total of Payment
Orders in Voting Tokens naming that Player as Payor that they have
thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to all current Officers, requiring them to issue, for every
Player, a Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, and that Player as
Payee, for an amount of Proposal Notes equal to the sum total of
Payment Orders in Indulgences naming that Player as Payor that they
have thus far executed and have not been satisfied.

I hereby issue Injuctions of the sort described in Rule 1736,
applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue, for each Player, a
Payment Order naming the Bank as Payor, that Player as Payee, for an
amount of 5 VTs. (So we can Vote on Proposals, y'know...)

The above facially satisfy provisions i) through iv) of Rule 663
pertaining to Injunctions; it is my belief that they also satisfy v),
though that requires us to examine any Rule relevant thereto. I find
one, Rule 1736 itself, which states

      The Rules may require, in certain cases, that a Judge issue an
      Injunction ordering the execution of a Payment Order.  If the
      Payment Order required by such an Injunction is executed, and
      the Injunction itself later set aside, the Player who executed
      the required Payment Order shall, as soon as possible after the
      Injunction was set aside, vacate that Payment Order.

This merely states that Rules are permitted to require Judges to
issue Injuctions under certain circumstances; it is as far as I can
see no bar to a Judge taking it upon emself to issue any legal
Injuction. No prohibition of any kind in fact obtains with respect to
issuing Injuctions defined in 1736/1737; the procedure for issuing an
Injunction is well delineated, and followed to a T in this Judgement;
issuing an Injunctions in the present circumstances is therefore
possible and unprohibited, which I submit is all that 'in a manner
consistent with the Rules' requires.

Lastly, a note as to intent - obviously, this loophole can be used for
massive personal gain (well, once the status of Currencies has been
determined), and just as obviously it will be extremely tempting for
other Players assigned to Judge CFJs to take advantage of it for the
same reasons. It could also be used to summarily deregister anyone
from the Game by assigning them 31 Blots.

There is no limit to how far this could be abused; if everyone jumps
on that bandwagon, all we will do is spoil the game absolutely. Better
we should fix that loophole, and quick, and refrain from doing
anything else about it for the sake of preserving the game's fun.

I think the above is even-handed enough that Players (especially
Justices or Judges with CFJs currently assigned to em) will see their
own interest in letting it stand at that.

(And remember, you ain't seen nothing yet.)

Steve, you sent your call for appeal to discussion, I think you may need to
post it to the PF.

How could the use of the plural form 'Injunctions' possibly be used
to indicate that there was more than Order? As you yourself point out,
R663 allows a single Injunction to require the issuing of more than
one Order. Morendil could have issued a single Injunction applying to
all the Officers, requiring them make multiple POs. All he needed to
have to have done was to say:

      I hereby issue an Injunction, applying to each current Officer,
      requiring them issue Payment Orders of such-and-such a kind.

But that's not what he did. Your first observation was the correct one:
the fact that Morendil used the plural form 'Injunctions' must be taken
to indicate that there is one Injunction for each current Officer who
meets the description.

>The last sentence/paragraph reads:

The last paragraph is distinctly *not* like the other three, in that
it does not use the construction "for each ucrrent Officer".

"...Injunctions, applying to the Registrar, requiring em to issue,
for each Player..." is very clearly one Injunction for each Player.

I don't see how you can possibly read this as only one Injunction.

In light of these errors, I hereby call for the Appeal of CFJ 1055.

		"Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate."

======================================================================

Judge:       Blob (defaulted)
	     Oerjan

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito, elJefe, 
	     General Chaos, Harlequin, Michael, Kolja A., Murphy,
	     Oerjan, Steve, Vir, Vlad, Zefram

Not eligible:
Caller:      Murphy
Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     

======================================================================

History:
  Called by Murphy, 08 Oct 1997 23:23:37 -0700
  Assigned to Blob, 10 Oct 1997 20:49:59 +0200 (MET DST)
  Blob defaults
  Assigned to Oerjan, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.

                               CFJ 1059

Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of Lawlessness sent to
the PF must contain an explicit declaration that a particular Player is
Lawless.


======================================================================

Judge:       Blob (not a Player anymore)
	     elJefe

Judgement:   

Eligible:    Andre, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, elJefe,

  Blob is deregistered.
  Assigned to elJefe, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Unfortunately, I can't think of any better argument at the moment
other than "intention".  Clearly R1714 was intended to make the reporting of
Lawlessness optional (and slightly dangerous).  Scott's interpretation makes
the reporting of Lawlessness mandatory and opens the Herald up to being
prosecuted for a Class A crime if e makes a mistake in reporting someone's
Blots while having no intention of alleging Lawlessness.

Hmm, this gives me an idea for another argument.  To "allege" something
requires intent on the part of the alleger.  The fact that the commission of a
crime can be inferred from someone's statement of fact does not mean that
someone has alleged that a crime has been committed.  Simply reporting a number
of Blots does not clearly identify the Herald's intentions wrt Lawlessness and
therefore cannot be considered equivalent to an explicit declaration that a
Player is Lawless.

Relevant Rules: 1714

I had hoped to delay my Judgement of this Appeal until after the passage
of my proposed amendment to R1693, which would prevent a third, and
very tedious, re-assignment of this CFJ in the event of another split
decision. But the VP for P3573 won't conclude until the early morning
of Fri, 31 Oct, Melbourne time, and CotC Andre's prompt distribution
of the Appeal means that my Judgement is due before then. Ah, the 
privileges of Office. Since there is no point delaying, I may as well
be prompt.

Predictably, I overturn Judge Vir's decision and find the Statement
FALSE.

What neither Judge Vir, nor Justice Andre in his first decision as
Appeal Justice (whom Vir followed in making his Judgement), have
considered, which properly they ought to do, is that it's clear from
R1431 that an Officer's reasons for denying a COE are irrelevant
in determining whether eir decision to deny a COE was correct. As
Justice elJefe points out in his first Appeal Judgement, this is
as it should be.

Harlequin's original message stated: "I transfer 4 VTs to the Bank,
to satisfy VT POs 1040 and 1041". General Chaos denied that this
message constituted Transfer Orders satisfying the POs mentioned.
In this he was completely correct. Harlequin did not have 4 VTs at
the time he sent the message, and so no message of his sent at that
time could have satisfied those POs. That is all we need to know in
order to determine that General Chaos was correct to deny the COE.
