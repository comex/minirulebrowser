                               CFJ 1065

"The Office of Speaker-Elect is not now being held in the normal fashion."

======================================================================

Judge:       Vlad
Judgement:   FALSE

Justices:    Morendil (S), Steve (J), Kolja A. (pro-C)
Decision:

Eligible:    Andre, Blob, Calabresi, ChrisM, Chuck, Crito,
	     General Chaos, Kolja A., Michael, Morendil, Murphy,
	     Oerjan, Steve, Swann

Ineligible:  Vlad (Judge)

Barred:
On request:  Vanyel
On hold:     Harlequin, Vir

History:

  Assigned to Vlad, 6 Nov 1997 11:52:39 +0100
  Judge FALSE, 12 Nov 1997 20:03:38 -0600

  Appealed by Gen Chaos, 13 Nov 1997 06:26:45 -0500
  Assigned to Morendil, Steve, and Kolja A. as Justices, as of this message

======================================================================

(Caller's) Arguments:

Rule 1006: An Office must be held by a Player.
Rule 790:  The Winner of the Election shall hold the Office.

This is a conflict.  Rule 790 takes precedence, so Morendil (a non-Player)
holds the Office of Speaker-Elect.

Now:

Rule 1006: An Officer is a player holding an Office.

This is an explicit definition.  There is no conflict with any other Rule,
so the Office of Speaker-Elect is held by someone who is not an Officer
(Morendil).

Rule 790:  An Office is held in the normal fashion only if held by an
_Officer_ who was elected to it (among other things).

The Office of Speaker-Elect does not satisfy this requirement.  Therefore
it is not being held in the normal fashion.

======================================================================

Judge's Arguments:

Rule 1006 does clearly require an officer to be a Player. However,
as has been pointed out, it is trumped in ths case by 760. It remains
to be seen how this affects the readin of the rest of 760

An Office is "held in the normal fashion" if and only if the
      Officer holding that Office was elected to that Office and has
      neither resigned from it nor been retired or removed from it.
      An Office which is not held in the normal fashion is said to be
      held temporarily.

I must disagree that this directly requires an Office to be held
by an Officer to be held "in the normal fashion" It seems transparent
that this is simply an assumption made by the Rule, not aware of the
possible ramifications of the rest of the Rule. To interpret this
implicit assumption as imposing any sort of requirement is, in my
opinion, strained, particularly as the Rule still makes sense if
we read Officer in the sense of "person holding an Office" rather
than in the specialized sense used by 760, and since it is 760
itself that, elsewhere, defeats the definition that 1006 attempts to
impose. This interpretation does least violence to the Rule.

Vlad

Text of Adopted Proposals (unofficial)
======================================================================

Proposal 3579 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Stranded Currencies 

Be it therefore resolved, that a Rule be created with the following
text:

      The Chancellor is empowered to submit Transfer Orders for any
      entity which lacks an Executor, as if e were the Executor of
      that entity, but may do so only as specified by this Rule.

      Whenever there exist units of any Currency in the possession of
      any entity which neither has an Executor nor is in Probate, the
      Chancellor shall (as soon as possible after being made aware of
      this condition) execute Transfer Orders transferring all such
      Currencies to the Bank.

======================================================================

Proposal 3580 (G. Chaos)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Improper Transfers

Be it therefore resolved, that the following Rule be created:

      If it is determined by CFJ that the execution of a specific
      Transfer Order was in violation of the Rules or in violation of
      any other legal instrument granted binding force by these Rules,
      then:

      a) if the Transfer Order was executed to satisfy a Payment
         Order, the Judge of the CFJ shall vacate that Payment Order;

      b) otherwise, the Judge of the CFJ shall issue a Payment Order
         for an amount equal to the amount transferred illegally,
         naming as payor the recipient of the improper transfer and as
         payee the source of that transfer.
      
      However, the Judge shall not vacate a Payment Order under (a) if
      that Order has already been vacated, nor shall e issue a Payment
      Order under (b) if the improperly transferred Currencies have
      already been voluntarily refunded by the recipient of the
      improper transfer.

======================================================================

Proposal 3581 (Oerjan)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Exorcise Probate

Amend Rule 1738 by replacing the text

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity, and empowered only to submit Transfers Orders for that
      entity.  An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute
      and vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.  This Rule takes precedence over any other Rule which
      would specify a different Executor for an entity in Probate.

with

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is not its Executor, but
      is empowered to submit for that entity any Transfers Orders
      required by the Probate Code, with the same effect as if e
      were its Executor.  This Rule takes precedence over any other
      Rule which would prohibit Transfer Orders, if submitted in
      accordance with the Probate Code, from being effective.

      An Executor in Probate also has the power to execute and
      vacate certain Payment Orders, as specified by the Probate
      Code.

Amend Rule 1713 (Debt) by replacing both instances of "Executor" with
"Executor if any".

[#2: By Kolja A's request, clarified that entities in Probate do not
commit Persistent Indebtedness.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3582 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal-O-Matic

     This Rule shall be known as the Repeal-O-Matic Rule and may be 
     referred to unambiguously in that manner.  The Repeal-O-Matic Rule 
     is a Proposing Entity, and its Executor is the Promotor.

     The Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall make from one to three proposals 
     every week.  The contents of these Proposals are determined as 
     follows.  The Promotor shall select five different Rules, at 
     random, from the current Ruleset.  E shall then pick a number of 
     these selected Rules (at least one, and not more than three, and 
     no Rule picked more than once) to be used for the Repeal-O-Matic
     Rule's Proposals.

     The Promotor shall make these selections as soon as possible after 
     the beginning of the Nomic Week.

     For each Rule picked by the Promotor, the Repeal-O-Matic Rule shall 
     submit a Proposal that consists of the following quoted text, with 
     substitutions mandated by this Rule:

          "PROPOSAL: Repeal Rule [Number]
                     This Proposal shall have an AI = [Power]
                     Rule [Number] is hereby Repealed."

     Where [Number] in the quoted text is replaced by the Rule Number of 
     the Rule picked by the Promotor, and [Power] is replaced by the 
     Power of that same Rule.

     For the purpose of the Rules governing Proposals, it shall be 
     deemed that The Repeal-O-Matic Rule has submitted its Proposal 
     concerning a given Rule immediately after the Promotor makes the
     selection of that Rule.

{Comment: A permanent floating Chromatic Repeal, granting a few extra
          perks to the Promotor.  (Note that if these Proposals become 
          Interested, a distinct possibility, the ROMR can earn stuff 
          that the Promotor, as its Executor, can disperse as e sees 
          fit.)}

======================================================================

Proposal 3586 (Vlad)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Pardons
Create a Rule with the following Text:

The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Lawless Players. The
Clerk may not exercise this power more than once per Nomic month, and may not
Pardon the same Player twice in a given term of office (although, if re-elected
later, he may again Pardon that Player).  The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a
Player by announcing he is doing so in the Public Forum. At that time, the
following events may occur:
      1) The Clerk of the Courts shall request the Herald to eliminate
all Fugitive Blots owned by the Pardoned Player, and the Herald shall do
so as soon as possible.
      2) The Clerk of the Courts may, if necessary, vacate any Payment
Orders for Indulgences possessed by the Pardoned Player's estate in order to
reduce the number of Blots possessed by the Player's estate to below the
threshhold for Lawlessness. The CotC may not Vacate Payment Orders for X number
of Indulgences if Vacating PO's for a lesser number of Indulgences would
suffice to render the Player no longer Lawless.
      3) After the above two actions have been completed, the Player may
immediately reregister.
      4) The Pardoned Player shall then post a Formal Apology to the
Public Forum for his Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to ten
Prescribed Words in his Pardon.
      5) A Pardoned Player is not subject to Persistent Indebtedness
penalties for three months after being Pardoned, but during this period he must
apply all Indulgences received (from any source) to his debt and may not
transfer them to another Entity.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
Fugitive Blots, when a deregistered Player may reregister, or Persistent
Indebtedness.

[I was going to originally make this a prerogative of the Speaker, but
Swann's Proposals would already give the Speaker much power and anyway, to CotC
is not paid enough :-)]

======================================================================

Proposal 3590 (Swann)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
The Internomic Encouragement Act

Let the following rule be created:
(Title: Awards for InterNomic Proposals)

     A Player who submits an InterNomic Proposal shall receive the 
     following awards based upon the results of that InterNomic 
     Proposal.  The Ambassador shall pay out these awards as soon as 
     possible after e announces the results of the InterNomic Proposal.

       i) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, and Agora did 
          not vote FOR it, there is no award.
      ii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal fails, but Agora did 
          vote FOR it, the award shall be one Voting Token.
     iii) In the case where the InterNomic Proposal passes, the award 
          shall be five Voting Tokens and two Proposal Notes.

     In addition, if the adoption of the InterNomic Proposal directly 
     results in Agora receiving enough InterNomic points to win a game 
     of InterNomic, the Player who submitted that InterNomic Proposal 
     shall Win the Game (of Agora).

{Comment: Some encoragement for submitting IN Proposals, and a reward
          for having Agora win.}

======================================================================

Proposal 3591 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Repeal Pitchfork

Let Rule 1675 (Pitchfork-Wielding Angry Villagers) be repealed.

======================================================================

Proposal 3593 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
InterNomic Proposal cleanup

Amend Rule 1633 (InterNomic Proposals) to read:

      Players are permitted to submit InterNomic Proposals, which are
      distinct from Proposals in Agora, by sending to the Ambassador
      a text which is clearly intended to become an InterNomic
      Proposal. If a Player does so, the Ambassador shall be required
      to submit it, as soon as possible, to InterNomic in conformance
      to InterNomic procedures.

      In no case shall such submission, or the distribution by the
      Ambassador of text clearly labeled as InterNomic Proposals cause
      the Proposing of Proposals in Agora, any Rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.

[Explanation:
Removes the restriction to one IN Proposal per Player per week,
disinfects the Rule (it still contained the old Virus sentence!),
and improved the wording.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3594 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Shorten InterNomic Voting Period

Amend Rule 1632 (InterNomic Voting Procedure) by replacing the phrase

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until one week before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

by:

      * Duration of Voting : the Voting Period shall last for one
      week, or until 72 hours before the InterNomic Voting Period on
      the relevant InterNomic Proposal is over, whichever is earliest.

[Explanation:
Avoids short (if the Ambassador happens to be slow) or even negative
(if the Ambassador happens to be Tardy) Voting Periods.]

======================================================================

Proposal 3595 (Andre)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)
Liaison? Which Liaison?

Amend Rule 1634 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's"
Amend Rule 1631 by replacing "Liaison's" by "Ambassador's" in all
its concurrences.

======================================================================

Proposal 3596 (Kolja A.)  AI = 1  (Disinterested)

Amend 1715 by replacing the sentence       

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to the Assessor to that
      effect.

with

      A Player may declare that e is PRESENT on a Proposal, Election
      or Referendum, by sending a message to that effect to the Vote 
      Collector of this Proposal, Election or Referendum.

[At the same time, correct the spelling error in the rule's title so it
reads "Announcing One's Presence" (not "Annoucing").]

It doesn't, mainly because R880 seems to use language which bases
events in the present on events in the future.  It says: "for an
appointment to be valid, this Player [the putative new holder of the
Office], must either explicitly and publically consent to becoming the
new holder of that Office within seven days of such appointment, or be
the Speaker."

So a resignation can happen as long as the resigner makes an
appointment.  An appointment is to either the person named or the
Speaker if no-one is named.  But if you name someone, the validity of
doing so is dependent on their agreeing to the position within seven
days.  The resignation rule can actually require us to predict the
future when the resignation happens.

I think this is slightly different from retroactivity in general,
though it looks much the same once someone consents and we
retroactively install them in the office.  For example, who is the
Justiciar now?  elJefe has resigned, but Steve hasn't consented to the
appointment.  If he is to do so in the next seven days, he is
temporarily in office.  If he doesn't, then he's not.

Fundamentally, the problem is that our rule language can express
"impossible" concepts (basing events now on events in the future).
Rather than restrict our use of language, I think this is probably a
good case for a judicial interpretation to effectively rewrite the
rule for us in the interests of common sense and the game's best
interests &c.

Therefore I make the following CFJ:

  Steve is currently holding the Office of Justiciar.

I bar Steve.

I also urge Steve not to consent to the appointment until the Judge
has returned their Judgement, and simultaneously urge the Judge to be
quick about returning the Judgement.  This way they have to judge in
an "impossible" situation.  I bar Steve only because I believe that he
would Judge being able to know whether or not he is going to consent
to the appointment, thereby defeating the CFJ's ulterior motive.

Finally, I disagree with Zefram who claims that consent is part of the
appointment process.  The wording of 880 suggests more to me that an
Officer need only specify a successor Player in order to be able to
resign, and that this action takes place regardless of the validity of
that appointment.  (Though I wonder, what happens if you appoint
someone currently On Hold?)

Michael.

======================================================================
Reasoning and arguments of Judge:

My first impulse was to Judge this trivially True, because the caller
was so set on having the Judgement made in a completely indeterminate
state where we didn't know if Steve consents or not.  But, while having
Steve consent skewers the motive behind the CFJ, I've come to realize
that it doesn't make the Statement trivial, or any less interesting.

What we have here is a question about a transitional event.  These kind
of events seem to be were a lot of the interesting matter happens, and
many profound CFJs have ruled on what actually happens between point A
and B. (The recent destruction of currencies is a case in point.)
Therefore I intend to plumb the issue with an open mind.

The core question we have here is from Steve eimself, "when an Officer
resigns and appoints a Player other than the Speaker to succeed em, and
the other Player consents (as is the case here), when does the change of
Office occur?"

The caller opines that Rule 880 requires a prediction of the future.
Upon a careful reading of the rule, I think not.  The first sentence
says;

     "An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office."

That clearly installs the specified Player in the Office.  It is my
opinion that the Rule makes the most sense if interpreted as a
chronology of what happens when an Officer resigns (and appoints someone
other than the Speaker);

     a) Sentence 1, the Office is held temporarily by the specified
        Player and the resigning Player ceases to hold that Office.
     b) The Specified Player holds the Office temporarily until e
        consents, refuses, or stays silent for seven days.
     c) If e doesn't consent, then Rule 880 invalidates the appointment.
        This is I believe the most sensible interpretation of the Rule's
        provisions.  The language of the Rule IMO, provides a
        presumption of validity that holds until the Rule says
        otherwise.  i.e. all appointments are valid until the Office is
        refused or seven days without consent have passed.
     d) If the appointment is invalidated I believe that the sentence,
        "An Officer who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed
        to have appointed the Speaker to succeed em." can be justifiably
        read as applying to the person refusing the Office, i.e.
        Refusing an appointment is akin to resigning without specifying
        a successor.  Reading events in this matter requires no
        precognition, insures that the identity of the Officer in
        question is not inderterminate at any point, and renders the
        verdict TRUE at the time the statement was made, whatever
        Steve's decision had been.

Therefore I judge the Statement TRUE based on Common Sense and the best
interests of the Game.




Evidence:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 880/4 (Power=1)
Resignation of Offices

      An Officer is always permitted to resign from any Office e
      holds, provided e specifies another Player to succeed
      em, who then becomes the temporary holder of that Office.  For
      this appointment to be valid, this Player must either explicitly
      and publically consent to becoming the new holder of that Office
      within seven days of such appointment, or be the Speaker.  The
      Speaker can be appointed to hold an Office temporarily without
      consenting, and may not refuse such an appointment.  An Officer
      who resigns without appointing a successor is deemed to have
      appointed the Speaker to succeed em.

      A change in the identity of the Speaker does not automatically
      cause the transfer of any Offices being held by the former
      Speaker to the new Speaker.

======================================================================
Requested Injunction:

In case of a Judgement of TRUE, I request that the Judge issue
an Injunction requiring the Rulekeepor to annotate R1558 with
a copy of the Statement and the list of Relevant Rules.


======================================================================
Caller's Arguments:

I'll take the unusual step of presenting arguments for both sides. I'm
not really advocating any particular Judgement. I just think the matter
should be resolved one way or the other. I'll leave it to the Judge
to decide which e prefers. Perhaps the Judge will find some new
argument which I haven't thought of to resolve the matter.

R1647 states:

      The Speaker can never hold the Office of Speaker-Elect, even
      temporarily.

while R1558 states:

      No Player may be Nominated who would not be permitted to hold
      the Office which the Election is seeking to fill.

On the side of a Judgement of TRUE, we have the observation that
if a Player who is the Speaker were still to be Speaker when e
was Elected Speaker-Elected, e would not be permitted to hold the
Office, even temporarily. This seems to show that the Speaker
cannot nominate for Speaker-Elect.

On the other hand, however, how can we be sure that the Player
who is Speaker would still be Speaker when the Election for the
Office of Speaker-Elect concluded? If the Player had somehow
ceased to be Speaker, nothing would prevent em from holding the
Office of Speaker-Elect, were e to win the Election. And it is not
difficult to imagine ways in which the a Player who is the Speaker
might cease to be Speaker in time take up the Office of Speaker-Elect.
Here are three:

1. By proposal. From the call for Nominations to the announcement of
the results, an Election in which there are multiple Candidates takes
at least two weeks to complete. In that time, a high-Powered Rule
might be be adopted removing the Player from the position of Speaker.

2. By giving up the Speakership voluntarily. Although R681 prevents
a Speaker who gives up the Speakership voluntarily from nominating
emself for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the Rule does not say that
the Speaker may not already be nominated at the time e gives up
the Speakership.

3. By going On Hold. Eir doing so would constitute the Crime of
Speaker Inactivity (see R1375), with the quite heavy penalties
entailed by this, but that would not make em ineligible to hold the
Office of Speaker-Elect.

Whether the Judge finds these latter considerations persuasive will
largely depend on how e chooses to construct the phrase 'would not
be permitted to hold the Office'. If e chooses to read it 'would
*certainly* not be permitted to hold the Office', then I think a
Judgement of FALSE is indicated, since I think I've shown above
that we cannot be certain that a Player who is the Speaker would
not be permitted to hold the Office of Speaker-Elect were e Elected
to that Office. On the other hand, if e chooses to read it as 'would
not be permitted to hold the Office, other things being equal' then
a Judgement of TRUE is indicated, since all of the possibilites I've
raised fall into the category of other things not being equal.

======================================================================
(Caller's) Arguments:

Morendil becomes Elde's EiP.
Rule 1738 says that Elde's EiP is eir Executor, so Morendil is Elde's
  Executor and succeeds in reregistering Elde.
Elde becomes Blob's EiP.
By a similar argument, Elde is Blob's Executor and succeeds in reregistering
  Blob.
Elde is deregistered.
No Rule states that a Player who is deregistered loses eir Executor or EiP,
  so Morendil is still Elde's Executor and EiP.
Rule 1478's statement that Executors must be Players takes precedence over
  Rule 1738's claim that Blob's EiP (Elde) is eir Executor, so Elde is no
  longer Blob's Executor.
However, no Rule states that an EiP who is deregistered ceases to be EiP,
  so Elde is still Blob's EiP.

When Elde ceased to be Blob's Executor, e did not cease to be Blob's EiP -
precisely because the equality of EiP and Executor (which exists only
because Rule 1738 says so) is broken by way of Rule 1478 starting to take
precedence over Rule 1738.


======================================================================
Decision & Reasoning Judge:

I judge TRUE.

As the Caller argues, no Rule requires an EiP to remain a Player after e
has been selected.


======================================================================
Decision of Justiciar elJefe:  Overturn and judge FALSE

CFJ 933 established that all units of currency had disappeared on 15 July,
and no new ones were minted before October.  Thus I find that when Blob
deregistered on 6 August, e possessed no units of any currency.

Thus Blob was not placed into Probate by Rule 1601.  Unless the Rules
authorize the Notary to place people into Probate arbitrarily, or to
appoint an EiP for entities not in Probate (which I doubt), I find that
Blob was never in Probate

Further, when Elde was deregistered on 25 July he also had no Currencies
and thus was never in Probate, and so Morendil could not be his EiP.  Thus
Morendil's attempt to reregister him had no effect.  When the Notary
attempted to appoint an EiP for Blob, Elde was not a Player.

For both (or either) of these reasons, the Notary's attempted appointment
of Elde as Blob's EiP had no effect.

Thus Elde was never an Executor in Probate for Blob.

-----------------------------
Addendum: I now realize that this misreads Rule 1601 and is incorrect.
-- elJefe


======================================================================
Decision of Speaker Morendil:  Sustain

Judge Oerjan argues that a person, when assigned as a Player of
Agora the status of Executor in Probate, by authority of the Notary,
retains this status even if e later ceases to be a Player.

The Caller, for their own part, argued that even though, when a
person ceases to be a Player, e may no longer be an Executor, the
status of Executor in Probate is granted independently from that of
Executor and may therefore be retained.

Rule 1478 (Executors) states, in part :

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e was that entity.

Rule 1738 (Executors in Probate) states, in part :

      The Executor in Probate of an entity is the Executor of that
      entity.

The above provision in 1478 establishes two distinct effects of the
law :

* that only some persons, namely Players, may qualify as Executors
* that a person who is designated as an Executor is empowered to act
   on the behalf of some other entity.

These consequences, let me add, are not deduced from the bare
statement "The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered,
etc." and its wording, but rather by construing this provision in
the light of other provisions pertaining to Executors.

(Judge Kolja A. in 1065 : "The sentence quoted from 1478 is not a
_definition_ of "Executor", but an assignment of certain powers to
the executor.")

For instance, Rule 1735 states that "The Chancellor is the Executor
of the Bank." This is clearly seen as granting on a particular Player
the status of Executor of some particular entity, with the associated
prerogatives.

The above provision in Rule 1738 is quite similar to that in 1735. It
identifies a particular Player - one who has been designated by the
Notary as the Executor in Probate of a particular entity - and grants
that Player the status of Executor.

In both cases, should the person granted the status of Executor cease
to be a Player, e would therefore cease to qualify for this status
under Rule 1478, and eir continued exercise of the 'powers of
Executor' with respect to the entity e was previously the Executor
of would therefore be inconsistent with Rule 1478.

However, that person's identification as either Chancellor or
Executor in Probate of the relevant entity may be obtained
independently of that person's status as a Player.

For instance, we have recently been made aware that a person could
come to hold an Office without necessarily being a Player. Such a
situation could conceivably apply to the Chancellor; in this case, I
would interpret Rule 1735, not as dictating that that person cannot
be Chancellor, but only that that person cannot be the Bank's
Executor.

The part of Rule 1738 which assigns to a person the status of
Executor in Probate of a particular entity reads as follows :

      Whenever there is an entity in Probate which does not have an
      Executor in Probate, the Notary shall nominate a Player to be
      that entity's Executor in Probate..

This provision could conceivably interpreted such that, to qualify as
an Executor in Probate, a person must be a Player at all times;
however, it could also be interpreted, in a manner more consistent
with recent custom that a Candidate in an Election may come to hold
Office even while no longer a Player, such that a person must only be
a Player at the time of their appointment as EiP to qualify for that
status.

I therefore see no strong reason to overturn Judge Oerjan's
Judgement, and - I must add, with some reluctance - Sustain the
original Judgement of TRUE.


======================================================================
Decision of Justice Andre:  Sustain

Nowhere do the Rules say that the Executor in Probate needs to be a
Player. The only thing they say is that to be elected as an Executor
in Probate one needs to be a Player.

The Appellants have argued that R1478 says that an Executor of an
Entity is a Player, and R1738 that an EiP is an Executor, and thus
an EiP must be a Player. However, this is not how Agoran logic works.
In Agora this means that the two Rules, in a case when an EiP is not a Player,
are in conflict. In Agora this means that the lower precedence Rule's
requirements are void. However, even if R1738 would be the lower precedence
Rule here (which I doubt), this still only means that Elde is not Blob
Executor, but not that Elde is not Blob EiP.

Thus I find the Judgement CORRECT.

H. Notary Murphy, H. Herald Crito!

As Swann's Executor in Probate, I hereby vacate any and all outstanding
Payment Orders for Indulgences naming Swann as Payor that I am permitted
to vacate as his Executor in Probate. Swann has no Creditors and no
Debtors, no Will and no Heirs. I therefore destroy any residual assets
of his that I am permitted to destroy as his Executor in Probate, and
announce that Swann is no longer in Probate.

Since the Courts appear, inexplicably to my mind, to have found that
Elde is Blob's Executor in Probate, there is nothing I can do for Blob.
