Once my group votes are registered, then X Vizier please accept my
resignation from the Group.  It is nothing personal, but I have noticed
that our ideologies were rather diverse.  While this is a good thing in
a larger context, I believe Groups should, at least in part, share a
vision.  So, with that, so long, and thanks for all the fish.

Threat Vizier, Members of Threat, please accept my application for entry
into the Threat Group.
