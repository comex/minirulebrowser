Whereas currently the Rules are such that serious discrepancies can
legally creep up in the Notary's Report,

Be it therefore resolved that Rule 1531 be Amended to read as follows:

      The Administrator of an Organization must keep an accurate copy
      of its Compact and an accurate list of the Players within the
      Compact's Jurisdiction.

      E must record any and all changes to the Compact, and must, As
      Soon As Possible after such changes, distribute an up-to-date
      copy of the Compact to every Player within the Compact's
      Jurisdiction.

      When the Compact of an Organization specifies that some changes
      are to take place regarding its Jurisdiction or the identities of
      the Administrator or Executor, 
      Whenever the Compact of an Organization specifies that the
      Organization's Executor (if any) is to change, the Administrator
      must inform the Notary of the identity of the new Executor.
      Whenever the Compact of an Organization specifies that the
      Organization's Administrator is to change, the Player who is to
      become the new Administrator must inform the Notary of this.
      Whenever the Compact of an Organization specifies that the
      Jurisdiction is to change, the Administrator must inform the
      Notary of the exact nature of the changes.  In all cases, the
      notifications must be made as soon as possible, and the changes
      take place upon the notification of the Notary.

      The Administrator of an Organization must come from within the
      Jurisdiction of the Organization's Compact unless otherwise
      specified by the Rules governing its Class.

Be it further resolved that the following paragraph be struck from Rule 1535:

      Whenever there is any change in a Compact's Jurisdiction,
      the Administrator of its Organization must inform the
      Notary of the change As Soon As Possible.
