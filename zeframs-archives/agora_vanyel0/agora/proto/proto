Proto
An alliterative Proposal to fix up protoes

Rule 1443 shall be Amended to read as follows:

      A Proto-Proposal is any text which meets the following conditions:

      * it has been sent to the Public Forum,
      * the author of the message containing the Proto-Proposal is verifiable,
      * the author has clearly identified the text as a Proto-Proposal

      A Proposal is considered to have been Proto-Proposed if a Proto-Proposal
      has been made between three and fourteen days prior to the Proposal's
      submission, which is identical to the submitted Proposal.

      The Proposer of any Proposal which has been Proto-Proposed and which
      Passes shall receive two Points upon the publishing of Voting Results
      by the Assessor.  The Assessor is responsible for reporting this score
      change.

{Comments:
I was looking at Rule 1443 for an entirely different reason when I noticed
how very holey it was.  I fixed up the language so it would do what we
have been thinking it was doing, and made two additional modifications.  I
changed the window for protoing from 4-14 to 3-14 days before a Proposal,
because a Proposal has almost always been protoed multiple times, and the
final proto is usually a formality, and 3 days is plenty even if one
doesn't work weekends.  Also, I changed the time-of-award of the Proto
bonus to coincide with the posting of results, so as not to have an
indeterminate score between the end of the VP and the posting of results.

For reference, 1443 currently reads:

Rule 1443/0 (Mutable, MI=1)
Bonus for Proto-Proposing

      A Proposal may be proto-Proposed by sending it to the Public
      Forum and identifying it as a proto-Proposal.

      A proposal which passes, and which was proto-proposed in the
      same form between four and fourteen days before being submitted
      as a proposal, shall earn its proposer an extra two points at
      the end of the voting period.}
