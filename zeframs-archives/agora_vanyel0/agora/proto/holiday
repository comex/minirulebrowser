Proto-PROPOSAL
Nomic Holidays

Any Player may Propose a Holiday Directive.  It will specify a certain
period of time for a Nomic Holiday.  If the Directive passes with an
Adoption Index of 1 or greater, Nomic business shall not be conducted
during that period, and when determining time limits such as those 
specified by "as soon as possible" or the 14-day deregistration limit,
this time is considered not to have passed.  All discussion can, of
course, continue.
