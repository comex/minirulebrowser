Hm.

Proto-Proposal DB6  (Vanyel)
(Creates a rule)
Critical Review of the CFJ Handling System

	As the current CFJ system seems to be inadequate, and the legal
ambiguity in the rules regarding Crimes is appaling, I propose the
following changes:
   --Any occurence in the rules of the phrase "Violation of this Rule is 
	a Class A Crime" or some variation therefrom, shall be interpreted
	as "If you do not comply with what has been decreed above, then 
	you shall be Guilty of a Class A Crime."  (Replacing A with the 
	appropriate Crime-type.)
   --There shall be several types of CFJ: Error, Illegality, Appeal, or
	Interpretation.  It must be explicitly stated somewhere in the
	CFJ what type it is.  Different procedures will be followed for
	each:
	   --Error.  In the case of an Error on the part of an Officer or
		other Player, a single Player shall be selected from the
		list of Active Players (not including the Player allegedly
		in Error, or the accusing Player, or any other Player 
		currently serving as a Judge) randomly by the Clerk
		of the Courts.  This Player will have no more than three
		days to render Judgement on the Error.  Eir judgement
		will be either "TRUE", "FALSE", or "UNDECIDED".  If "TRUE",
		then the Judge must issue an Injunction decreeing how to
		Fix the Error.  This Judgement may be Appealed.
	   --Illegality.  An illegality is total disobeyance of the Rules,
		a direct violation of Rule 101.  Being such a serious
		offense, any CFJ alleging an Illegality will require the
		appointment of three (3) Judges at random (by the Clerk
		of the Courts) from the list of Active Players, not 
		including the Plaintiff, the Defendant, or any of up to
		three (3) people explicitly Barred from the Case by the
		Plaintiff, or any other Player currently serving as a
		Judge.  These three Judges will render Judgement
		separately over the course of no more than one (1) week.
		They must rule "TRUE" or "FALSE".  If two or more of
		them vote "TRUE", then the Plaintiff wins the case and
		must propose an appropriate Punishment in the form of
		an NRC Proposal with the Declaration (Metes a Punishment).
		This Judgement may be Appealed.
	   --Interpretation.  This is a matter which totally affects the
		entire Nomic, so any Interpretation CFJ must be forwarded
		by the CotC to the Public Forum for Discussion.  After one
		week, the CotC shall glean the Public Opinion and write
		an RC Proposal to Annotate the Rule under Interpretation.
		The CotC will not receive any points, Marks, or other
		Quantity, or any Penalty (of points, Marks, or other
		Quantity) which normally would be associated with such
		a Proposal.  This is voted on like any other Proposal.
		The final vote may not be Appealed (although, of course, 
		the Rule can still be Amended.) 
	   --Appeal.  If at least three (3) Players request an Appeal
		of a previous CFJ, three (3) Judges will be appointed
		by the CotC at random from the list of Players, not 
		including the Plaintiff, the Defendant, any of up to
		three Players barred from the original case (no additional
		Players may be Barred from an Appeal), or anyone else
		currently serving as a Judge.  These Judges have one (1)
		week in which to review the case and the Rules, and
		post their Judgement to the Public Forum.  This Judgement
		must be either "OVERTURN" or "SUSTAIN".  If two or more
		of the Judges vote to Overturn, then the CFJ in question
		is declared void.  If the original CFJ was judged "TRUE",
		then all changes resulting from that CFJ are revoked.  If
		the original CFJ was judged "FALSE", then Game Play 
		continues as if the original CFJ has just ended with a
		judgement of "TRUE".  An Appeal may not be Appealed.
   --If at any time there are not enoguh eligible Players to Judge a CFJ, 
	then the CFJ and all its effects are postponed until enough Judges
	become available.  If there can not be (within the current list of
	Active Players) enough Players eligible to Judge, then ANY Player
	besides the Plaintiff and Defendant becomes eligible to Judge.
   --All effects of CFJ are assumed to take effect immediately upon the
	decision of the Judgement.

  I think we should get together on CFJ Reform. I like your ideas, indeed,
I came up with many of the same solutions in APPLE II. I agree that Players
should have a say in matters of Interpretation, so I have a provision for
such CFJ's to result in a Proposal. In other areas I think we can easily
amalgamate our ideas. What do you say??

That'd probably be a good idea.  I was mostly making my proto in response to
APPLE I, as APPLE II hadn't been protoed yet... we came up with them at the
same time.  Anyway, where would you like to start?
