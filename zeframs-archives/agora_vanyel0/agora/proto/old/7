I believe that the Mark deficit should *NOT* be repudiated, and so to
make up some of the difference, I proto the following:

Proto-PROPOSAL DB7  (Vanyel)
Nomic Taxes
(Creates a Rule)

Exactly once every Nomic Week, the Banker shall deduct .05 Mark from the
Account of every Player who has more than 1 Mark.  These deducted Marks
shall be added to the Bank.  

***END PROTO

This will provide a method (albeit slow) of returning Marks to the Bank.
The .05 Mark seemed sufficiently low... although that can be modified.
The 1 Mark minimum is there to prevent players "living in abject poverty"
from having to pay taxes.

At any rate, we need some way of returning Marks to the Bank without
repudiating the debt.  I also thought, perhaps, that a percentage tax
might work, but that would be up to you guys. (gals, its, etc.)

eek!  a tax!  and not only that, but a regressive tax!

i'd rather see a 1% per week tax than a flat tax.  this would be a way
of dealing with mark inflation, however.  if you want to give poverty
protection, make it 1% per week, with the first mark exempt _for
players only_.  groups get no tax break.  groups should definitely
have to pay any tax that players have to pay; else everyone will
transfer all their marks into their group treasuries.

we also need to stop destroying marks when players leave the game.  i
would rather see these transferred to the Bank.

this is reasonably close to what i'd like, although i would write it
as

      At noon GMT on Monday of each Nomic Week, a tax of 1% of all
      Marks held by Players in excess of 1.00 Mark, and of 1% of all
      Marks held by all non-Player Entities excluding the Bank, shall
      be levied.  This tax shall be collected by the Banker, and all
      revenues resulting from this tax shall be deposited in the Bank.

1% per week results in a 50% depletion in 69 weeks -- in other words,
after 69 weeks the Bank will have collected 50% of the Marks held by
Players as taxes (the actual value is close to 68.9675639).  each
doubling of the percentage halves this depletion time.  a 5% rate will
make the 50% depletion time roughly 13.5 weeks, or just about three
months.

i haven't received any of the Banker's records yet so i can't say how
many Marks there are out there, as well as the total quantity of Marks
held in arrears.  as soon as i know these data it will be easier for
me to recommend a tax rate.

One point I would make is that the tax should be on only the portion
of accounts over 1 Mark.  This reflects the way income taxes work in
the UK and (I presume) most other countries.  In this case, it
hardly matters, but on general principles it should be this way so
as not to discourage wealth creation.  In our taxation system, for
example, incomes up to about UK#5000 are untaxed, the next #25000 or
so are taxed at 25%, and those over #30000 are taxed at 40%.  If the 
system worked like DB7, when someone's salary increased from 29000
to 30000, their net income would go from 21750 to 18000.  But only
the part actually over #30000 is taxed at 40%, so your net income
never goes down when your gross goes up.

If we are ever going to expand the taxation system, this might
become important, so we should set the right precedent now.

Proposal
Nomic Taxes
(Creates a Rule)

At noon GMT on Monday of each Nomic Week, the Banker shall levy
a Tax on all Marks accounts except the Bank.  The Tax for Players
shall be 1% of all Marks owned by that Player in excess of 1.00, 
and the Tax for all non-Player Marks-holding Entities (excluding
the Bank) shall be 1% of all Marks owned by that entity.  All
proceeds from this Tax shall be entered into the Bank.

[It may be said that 1% per Week is a fairly stiff Tax; however,
considering that almost all to-Player Mark flow is directly from
the Bank, such a Tax does not seem prohibitive.  In addition, the
Rate may be changed later when the Bank is not so deeply in debt.
Once the Rule is in place, however, precedents may be set.]
