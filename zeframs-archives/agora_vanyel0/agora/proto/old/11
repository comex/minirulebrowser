Ah, erm, uh, "Stock Reform package"?  Can we say *ambiguous language*?
And, that last sentence can be deleted once the Rule passes.  Ditto for
the rest of the so-called "stock Reform Package"

That "from the Bank" bit is unnecessary under the *current* ruleset, but
hey, why leave it to chance?

Sounds good to me.  Reform Group, this is your Cue!  Speak now or forever 
hold your peace... and of course, vote FOR.

One problem I see... Kelly will be docked 1+2+3+4+5+6=21 Points for 
proposing these!  Thus,

Proto-PROPOSAL DB11  (Vanyel)
Reimbursal for Stock Reform
(Creates a rule)

If the Stock Reform package passes, the Scorekeepor shall award Kelly
21 points to reimburse her for multi-proposal penalties.

As soon as the points have been awarded, this rule shall repeal itself.
***END PROTO

Keep in mind that I use "Stock Reform Package" for lack of a better term...
it would be replaced by a more appropriate term in the Proposal.
