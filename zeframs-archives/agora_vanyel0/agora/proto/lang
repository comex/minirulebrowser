Fix outdated language

Rule 107 shall be Amended to read as follows:
      Every Proposal must be recorded before being Voted on.  A Proposal 
      which is Adopted must be applied to the Agora Gamestate in the form in 
      which it was Voted on.

Every Rule Change must be recorded before it may take effect.

{Comment:
The language we've got in the current 107 really makes me 
uncomfortable in some places.  Here is 107/0, the current version:

      Any proposed Rule Change must be written down (or otherwise
      communicated in print media) before it is voted on. If adopted,
      it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.

For one thing, I dislike the word "any".  I don't particularly like 
"print media" (does that include magnetic media?), and I would rather 
this apply to *all* Proposals, and *all* Rule Changes, instead of just 
Proposed Rule Changes.}
