PROPOSAL 2418 (Wes)
Repeal Referenda

Repeal Rule 1434

[Petitions are simpler, easier to execute, and more flexible than
Referenda. If the two do the same thing, then it would make sense to
replace the Referenda Rules with Petitions. Of course, having both Rules
in existance for a while might be a good idea, but we'll leave that up
to the Voters.]
