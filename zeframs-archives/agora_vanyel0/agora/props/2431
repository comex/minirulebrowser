PROPOSAL 2431 (favor)
Define blot-only Crimes

  Add to the end of Rule 1505/0, the following:

      Class 1 Crime:
        The Player receives 1 Blot.

      Class 2 Crime:
        The Player receives 2 Blots.

      Class 3 Crime:
        The Player receives 3 Blots.

      Class 4 Crime:
        The Player receives 4 Blots.

(Comment: This is to establish some infrastructure for the
Platonization Project, although it might be useful even if
the Project is not taken up.  It defines four new Crimes whose
penalties correspond to the current Rule 1439/1 penalties
for violating a Rule with MI=1,2,3,4, respectively.)
