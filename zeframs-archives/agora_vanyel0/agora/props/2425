PROPOSAL 2425 (Swann)
Vote of Confidence

Let the following Rule be created (Vote of Confidence Directive.):

     There is a Directive known as a Vote of Confidence (VOC).  A
     Proposal containing a VOC Directive has an Adoption Index (AI) of
     one, or greater if another Rule requires a higher AI for the
     Proposal.

     A VOC Directive must unambiguously specify a valid Official
     Document of Agora Nomic, as specified in other Rules.  If a VOC
     Directive specifies a Document that is not valid, or a Document
     that is no longer valid at the time of the Adoption of the Proposal
     containing the Directive, the Directive shall have no effect, even
     if its Proposal is Adopted.

     When the Rules refer to the "Adoption" of a VOC Directive, they
     mean that the VOC Directive was contained in a Proposal that was
     Adopted, and that the VOC Directive was allowed to have effect by
     this and other Rules.

Let the following Rule be created (Effects of Adoption of a VOC
Directive):

     Adoption of a Vote of Confidence (VOC) Directive conforms the
     Game State to what it would be if the valid Official Document
     specified within the VOC Directive was completely true and accurate
     at the time of the Document's publication in the Public Forum.
     i.e. the State of the Game upon Adoption becomes that specified
     within the Document, plus all subsequent legal changes between the
     time of its publication and the Adoption of the VOC Directive.

     All Game State changes due to a VOC Directive occur upon passage of
     the Directive. A VOC Directive does not have retroactive effects.

     A Document specified within an Adopted VOC Directive is true and
     accurate. The Game State it references may not be retroactively
     modified prior to the time it was published in the Public Forum,
     even to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or illegal move, or an
     Injunction.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
     allow such retroactive alterations or corrections to the Game
     State.

     In no way does a VOC Directive invalidate, reverse, alter or
     cancel any prior moves or transfers, even unrecorded or overlooked
     ones.  Nor does a VOC Directive change the legality or illegality
     of any prior move.  A VOC Directive only adjusts the actual Game
     State to conform to that perceived by the Players and Officers in
     Official Documentation.

     After a Document is subject to the adoption of a VOC Directive, the
     Player in charge of maintaining that Document shall annotate all
     subsequent publications of that Document with the date of the last
     such publication that was subject to the adoption of a VOC
     Directive.  i.e. the date the subject Document was published in the
     Public Forum, not the date the VOC Directive was Adopted.


Let the following Rule be created (Validity of VOC Documents.)

     In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of a
     Vote of Confidence (VOC) Directive, it must satisfy all the
     following criteria at the time the VOC Directive is Proposed:

          i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
             maintain the document.
         ii) The Rules required it to be published in the Public Forum.
             (A requirement that it be sent to all Players fulfills this
             criteria.)
        iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
         iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for Judgement
             (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
          v) The information within the Document has not been superseded
             by a subsequent Document.
         vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
             specifically excluded from all VOC Directives.

     Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period of
     a VOC Directive if any of the following occurs:

          i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document which
             contradicts the information in the prior Document. This
             does not apply if there is a COE alleging the contradiction
             is an error, and the error is admitted before the end of
             the VOC Directive's Voting Period.
         ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
             denied before the end of the VOC Directive's Voting Period.
        iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a pending
             appeal of a CFJ.

      If another Document is issued during the Voting Period of a VOC
      Directive that does not contradict the prior Document it does not
      alter the validity of the prior Document.
