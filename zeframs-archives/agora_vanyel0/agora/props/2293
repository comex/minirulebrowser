PROPOSAL 2293 (Morendil)
Fix Currency Directives

Amend Rule 1466 by appending the following sentence :

   The AI of a Proposal which contains such a Directive shall be at
   least 1.

[Comments : Rule 993 (apparently) breaks Currency Directives, as Chuck
noted in eir comments on my Formatting protos. This fixes them. This
was protoed on Dec. 12.]
