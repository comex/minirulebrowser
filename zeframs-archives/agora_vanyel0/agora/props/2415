PROPOSAL 2415 (Chuck)
Install Andre as CotC

This Proposal contains zero proposed Rule Changes and one Directive.

I.  Andre shall be installed in the Office of Clerk of the Courts.

[There is some question about whether Andre is CotC, making it
virtually impossible to decide anything by CFJ.  This will clear
up the question and restore the Courts.]
