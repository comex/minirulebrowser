<center><h1>Pan-Agoran Anarchists' League Ordinances</h1></center>

<ol>

<li>These are the Ordinances of the Pan-Agoran Anarchists' League,
    heretofore known as PAAL.  If all members agree on a particular
    change to these Ordinances, the Ordinances are thusly changed; the 
    Ordinancekeepor shall distribute the new Ordinances to all members.  
    All changes to these Ordinances take effect at the beginning of the
    first nomic week after the new Ords are sent out.
<p>
<li>The initial Vizier of this group is Jtael.  The Vizier may step
    down by posting a message to the public forum, announcing that e
    is resigning and specifying a player who immediately becomes the
    next Vizier.  The Vizier is also the Ordinancekeepor.
<p>
<li>Any Player who is not a member may join any time there are less than
    four members of the group by sending a message to the Vizier and the
    Notary indicating that e wishes to join.  Upon becoming a member for 
    the first time, four PAAL coins are created and transferred to that  
    Player.
<p>
<li>When a Player joins the Group, the Vizier assigns em a Group Voting
    Number, or GVN.  This GVN is the least nonnegative integer not 
    assigned to another member at the time.  A member's GVN remains
    constant during eir membership.  When a member leaves the group, eir
    GVN is revoked and may be reassigned to a future member. 
<p>
<li>There is a player known as the Group Voter, who decides how the group 
    will vote on proposals on proposals whose voting periods begin while e
    is Group Voter.  The Vizier casts the group's vote as decided by the 
    Group Voter.
<p>
<li>At the beginning of each Nomic Week, the Player whose GVN is the 
    least GVN assigned to a member and greater than the GVN of the 
    current Group Voter becomes the new Group Voter.  If there is no 
    such member, the member with lowest GVN becomes Group Voter.
<p>
<li>If there are any extra votes in the group's treasury, they may only 
    be cast with the consent of all group members.
<p>
<li>If there is any currency besides extra votes in the group's
    treasury, as much of it as can be divided equally among all
    members of the group shall be divided equally among all
    members. At the beginning of each nomic week, ten PAAL coins are
    created and placed in the PAAL treasury.
<p>
<li>There is a body of text known as the PAAL credo.  Initially the credo
    is empty.  Any player may at any time add, subtract, or alter one word
    in the PAAL credo by transferring a PAAL coin to the PAAL treasury;
    such coins are then destroyed.  The ordinancekeepor is required to 
    keep track of the PAAL credo.
