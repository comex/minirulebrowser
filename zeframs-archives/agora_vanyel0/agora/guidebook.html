<h1>
The Agora Guidebook
</h1>
<p>
<hr><p><h2>
Chapter I. Introduction
</h2> 

        The official name of the game of Nomic is "<strong>Agora</strong>."
It is played via e-mail, with two main distribution lists. Official
messages (those required by the Rules to be sent by Officers) are sent to
<strong>nomic-official@teleport.com</strong>, and business messages (those
required to be sent to the Public Forum) are sent to
<strong>nomic-business@teleport.com</strong>. Discussions are carried out at
<strong>nomic-discussion@teleport.com.</strong> To subscribe, send a
message to <strong>majordomo@teleport.com</strong> with body text <code>SUB
nomic-discussion</code>, <code>SUB nomic-business</code>, or <code>SUB
nomic-official</code>, or all three.<p>
        
        The Rules of the game are contained in the Ruleset. The Ruleset, as
of 18 Apr 95, is published by the Rulekeepor in a Logical format. The
Numerical format, formerly used, listed the rules in numerical order. (Each
Rule has a reference number associated with it; however, when Rules were
amended their numbers used to change, so Rules on any certain topic tend
to be scattered around the Ruleset.) The Logical Format presents the Rules
grouped into sections based on their subject matter. The Logical Ruleset
is much easier to understand, especially for new Players; however a copy
of the Numerical Ruleset is useful to have available for reference.<p>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter II. <a name="definitions">Vocabulary</a>
</h2> 

        Agora uses some terms which may be confusing or used in a way other
than their standard usage. It's not necessary to memorize these all now,
but refer back to this list as you read the <strong>Guidebook</strong>.
Here are some important terms to know:<p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a name="active">Active</a></strong>: Any Player who is not
<a href="#onhold">On Hold</a> is considered to be Active.<p>

<li><strong><a name="asap">As Soon As Possible</a></strong>: Within a week,
and before doing anything else one is subsequently required to do.<p>

<li><strong><a name="mutindex">Mutability Index</a></strong>: Ratio of
votes required to amend or repeal a rule.<p>

<li><strong><a name="nomicweek">Nomic Week</a></strong>: One week, beginning
at midnight <a href="#utc">UTC</a> each Monday.<p>

<li><strong><a name="onhold">On Hold</a></strong>: A condition Players can
be in when on vacation or otherwise unable to play Nomic for more than the
fourteen days allowed them between messages to the Public Forum. Players On
Hold are relieved of duties such as judging CFJ's, but cannot Vote.<p>

<li><strong><a name="pattitle">Patent Title</a></strong>: A title given to
a person (not necessarily a Player), usually as an honor. Examples include
the Zeitgeist (the Player who most recently had a proposal pass unanimously)
and the Hero (a non-Player who has made important contributions to Nomic).
See <a href="#upattitle">Unique Patent Title</a>.<p>

<li><strong>Public Forum</strong>: Essentially, the Nomic mailing list.
Defined as any medium designated as such by the Distributor.  Currently
this means the following lists: nomic-business@teleport.com, nomic-
official@teleport.com (used for Officer reports), and the "backup" list
nomic@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au  (NOTE: 'nomic-discussion', which is often
used for informal discussions, is NOT part of the "Public Forum").<p>

<li><strong><a name="quorum">Quorum</a></strong>: Quorum is defined as
50% of all <a href="#active">Active</a> Players or 35% of all Players,
whichever is greater.
Quorum must be met on each Proposal or else that Proposal automatically
fails.<p>

<li><strong><a name="upattitle">Unique Patent Title</a></strong>: A Patent
Title given to a certain Player once and for all. An example is the title
First Speaker, given to <strong>Michael Norrish</strong>, the first Speaker
of Agora. As opposed to Patent Titles such as Zeitgeist, which changes with
Player's Proposals, or Scamster, which can be awarded to multiple Players.<p>

<li><strong><a name="utc">UTC</a></strong>: Universal Time Coordinated;
this time zone roughly corresponds to Greenwich Mean Time, but never
changes and is not associated with any particular location on the globe.
This is the time zone that almost all Agora times are recorded in.
</ul>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter III. <a name="spivak">Spivak Pronouns</a>
</h2>

A matter of some note among Agorans is how to be referred to.  The "he
or she" construct becomes old very fast, and the "they" construct is
considered by some to be grammatically incorrect.  Referring to an
indeterminate person (or even a certain person of indeterminate gender)
by the word "he" is unacceptable to many.<p>

Thus, it has become Agora practice to use the Spivak pronouns to refer
to a third person singular of indeterminate gender.  These were first
introduced to Agora quite some time ago by Blob, who claims to have no
gender at all.  They were adopted joyously as a simple solution to a
touchy problem and are still in common use in the Ruleset and
discussion.<p>

It is, then, important to know the formation of the Spivak pronouns.
This is done by taking the third person plural form ("they") and
removing the "th" at the start of it. In the subjective case, the
final "y" is also removed.
Thus:
<pre>
Masc.   Fem.    Neut.  Plural     Spivak
=====   ====    =====  ======     ======
he      she     it     they       e
him     her     it     them       em
his     her     its    their      eir
his     hers    its    theirs     eirs
himself herself itself themselves emself
</pre>
and so on.<p>

It is currently under minor debate as to what the Spivak version of
"Mr." and "Ms." would be; there are three major factions.  One favours
using "Mir." (the derivation of which is an interesting exercise in folk
etymology), one favours "H." (for "Honourable"), and one favours ignoring
this entirely and just using "Mr.", "Ms.", or whatever suits them.<p>

The Spivak forms will be used throughout the remainder of the
Guidebook.<p>
<hr><p><h2>
Chapter IV. Rules
</h2> 

        Each Rule is either <strong>Mutable</strong> or <strong>
Semimutable</strong>. The vast majority, at
least at the current time, are <strong>Mutable</strong>; there are 18
or so <strong>Semimutables</strong>.<p>

        Each Rule has an associated <a href="#mutindex">Mutability Index
(MI)</a> which is currently restricted between 1 and 4. All
<strong>Mutables</strong> have an MI of 1. Precedence among Rules is 
determined by MI's - Rules with higher MI's take precedence over Rules 
with lower MI's. If two Rules have the same MI, then the Rule with the 
lower Rule Number takes precedence.<p>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter V: Players
</h2> 

        The term "Player" includes anyone registered to play in Agora Nomic.
This includes the Speaker, Officers, and other players. There is only one 
Speaker, and every other Player is a Voter (though nowadays the Speaker 
may vote as well).<p>
        
        The duties of the Speaker include:<p>

<ul>
<li> Making all random determinations (except when Rules specifically state
otherwise)
<li> Serve on the Court of Appeals when required
<li> Fulfill the duties of vacant Offices
</ul>

The Speakership is the reward for Winning the game.  In the past, 
this "reward" consisted of losing one's Vote and doing all the work of
distributing Proposals and counting Votes, for several weeks.  Nowadays
these responsibilities are distributed among the Voters, and the
Speaker is able to Vote.
<hr><p><h2>
Chapter VI: Making Proposals
</h2> 

        Any Player not <a href="#onhold">On Hold</a> may make a Proposal.
Most Proposals are Rule Change Proposals, or Proposals with the intent of
Creating, Repealing, Amending, or Mutating (i.e. changing the
<a href="#mutindex">MI</a> of) a Rule. There are also Directives, which do
not change the Ruleset but which take care of business like Running for
Office, or issuing Foreign Policy Directives.<p>

        To make a Proposal, a Player sends the Proposal to an Officer called
the Promotor, who numbers it and issues it for voting. The correct form for 
a Proposal is as follows:<p>

<pre>
---------------------------- 
Proposal XXX (Player)
Title

Proposal Text
---------------------------- 
</pre>

Where <code>Player</code> is the name (nickname) of the proposing Player,
and <code>Title</code> is the Title of the Proposal (all Proposals must have a
Title).<p>
(e.g.:)<p>
<pre>
---------------------------- 
Proposal XXX (BobJones)
Make Bob "Nomic Emperor"

The Player named "Bob" shall be known as the Nomic Emperor.
---------------------------- 
</pre>

	Rule segments quoted in Proposals (for inclusion, Amendment,
removal, whatever) should be less than 72 characters wide, not including
indentation.  If possible, Proposals should be shorter than 10 lines,
not including blank lines (this garners a bonus), and should not be
longer than 25 (as this earns a penalty).  Rule Changes to Amend a Rule
must mention the name or number of the Rule to be Amended and give a
specific replacement text.<p>

<h3> Protoproposing</h3>
<p>
        It is considered good manners to 'Protopropose' an idea before
making an actual Proposal.  Nowadays there is even a small reward. 
To Protopropose, just send your Proposal (marked 'Protoproposal') to 
the Public Forum, between 3 and 14 days before submitting it as a Proposal.
Usually some commentary or rationale is sent along with it.<p>
<p>
e.g.<pre>
---------------------------- 
Protoproposal BOB1
Make Bob Emperor

The Player called "Bob" shall be known as Emperor of Nomic.
---------------------------- 
[As everyone knows, Bob is perfect. We should glorify him in this way!]
</pre>
<hr><p><h2>
Chapter VII: Voting
</h2> 

        Once a Proposal has been submitted to the Promotor, e will
distribute it. The voting period for a proposal is exactly seven days from
the date and time of the distribution.<p>
        
        Votes should be sent to another Officer called the Assessor. E 
will collate them and distribute the results. Legal Votes are 
<strong>FOR</strong>, <strong>AGAINST</strong>, or <strong>ABSTAIN</strong>. 
The only legal effect of Abstaining is to fulfill <a href="#quorum">Quorum</a>.
Voters receive one point for each Proposal on which they Vote.<p>

        When the Voting is over, for each Proposal a Player has submitted
e receives <code>(F-A)</code> points, where <code>F</code> is the number
of Votes <strong>FOR</strong> and <code>A</code> is the number of Votes
<strong>AGAINST</strong>. Note that only Votes directly by Voters count for
this point gain or loss. (At various times, non-Player entities have
had a Vote.)<p>

	There are now floating around a number of individual "Extra Votes".
A player who has one of these may use it to cast an Extra Vote on one
Proposal, after which it vanishes.  Players may use only one Extra Vote
per proposal, and may trade or sell them if they wish.  When the total
number of Extra Votes is depleted a new batch is created and given to
all <a href="#active">Active</a> Players.

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter VIII: The Judicial System
</h2> 

        There is an officer known as "<strong>Clerk of the
Courts</strong>" (CotC). E administers the Judicial system, which
consists mainly of <strong>Calls for Judgement</strong> (CFJs). A CFJ is a
request for a Judging on the legality of a specific move or a clarification
of the correct interpretation of a certain Rule. An interpretation CFJ must
specifically allege that a Rule should be interpreted in a certain way. For
example, the following is <strong>NOT</strong> a legal CFJ:<p>

<pre>
---------------------------- 
CFJ XXX
Caller: Bob

How should Rule YYY be interpreted?
---------------------------- 
</pre>

The following <strong>IS</strong> a legal CFJ:

<pre>
---------------------------- 
CFJ XXX
Caller: Bob

Rule YYY should be interpreted such that Bob is known as Emperor of Agora Nomic.
---------------------------- 
</pre>

        CFJs should be submitted to the CotC. E or she will choose a Judge
randomly from the list of Players, excluding the Caller (the Player making
the CFJ) and up to three Players that the Caller chooses to bar from
Judgement. After the CotC has distributed the CFJ, the Judge has one week
in which to make a Judgement. Judges receive three points for judging a
CFJ, and an additional two points if their Judgement is "speedy," meaning
submitted to the CotC within three days.<p>

        All Judgements are either <strong>TRUE</strong>,
<strong>FALSE</strong>, <strong>UNDECIDEABLE</strong>, or
<strong>UNKNOWN</strong>. A Judgement must be
accompanied by reasons and/or arguments for the Judgement. After a
Judgement has been distributed by the CotC, Players may insist on its
Appeal. If at least three Players do so, the Judgement is Appealed, and is
re-Judged by three separate Justices. These are the Speaker, the Clerk of
the Courts, and the Justiciar. The Justiciar is an Officer whose sole duty
is to Judge Appeals.<p>

        These three Justices make their individual Judgements, and submit
them to the CotC. If at least two of them agree on the Judgement (i.e.
<strong>TRUE</strong>, <strong>TRUE</strong>, <strong>FALSE</strong>) then
the majority Judgement is official. If they are split three ways
(<strong>TRUE</strong>, <strong>UNDECIDED</strong>, <strong>FALSE</strong>)
then the Judgement is <strong>UNKNOWN</strong>.<p>

Chapter IX: Other Offices
</h2> 

<ul>
<li> <strong>The Registrar</strong>: Maintains the list of registered
Players, their nicknames, e-mail addresses, and real names, and whether

The current Assistant is Vanyel.</ul>
</p>
<hr><p><h2>
Chapter IX: Currencies and the Like
</h2> 

        There are several major quantifiable assets that a Player may posess.
They are listed here, with descriptions:<p>

<ul>
<li> <strong><a name="points">Points</a></strong>. When Agora Nomic first began, Points were the
only game in town. They are still the way in which one wins the game,
specifically by achieving a score of <code>( 10 * N * (1 + G/6) )</code>,
where <code>N</code> is the number of Players currently in the game and
<code>G</code> is the number of games the Player in question has already
won. Points are generally considered to be a measure of one's skill. New
Players begin with a score equal to the average of the scores of the other
Players, excluding all negative scores.  As of the Currency Reform of June
1995, Points are now officially Currency, and fall under the Rules for
Currencies.<p>

<li> <strong><a name="marks">Marks</a></strong>. Marks were intended to be the basis for an
Agoran economy. As of yet the economy is far from dynamic, mainly due to
the lack of goods people want to buy. Marks used to be used to declare a
Proposal Sane, that is, to prevent non-Players from Voting. Right
now they are essentially worthless.<p>

<li> <strong>Extra Votes</strong>. EVs were invented to allow Players
an additional Vote in favor or against a Proposal.  Since the supply is 
limited, they tend to be used only for proposals about which the players
feel strongly.  EV's may be used only once each, and no more than one
per Proposal is used, but they may be bought, sold, or traded.  They
are a commodity of some value, it seems, but there is no true consensus
on how many points they're worth.  When the supply gets too low a new
batch is created and distributed to all Players not On Hold.<p>

<li> <strong>Coins</strong>. Each <a href="#groups">Group</a> may mint its
own currency, called Coins.  Each Group's coins are different from those
of other Groups, and they are essentially fiat money, backed by the
dependability of the Group members.  The only coins currently in 
existence are Reform Group Coins, minted by the Reform Group and backed
under the Group's Regulations by the Point holdings of the Group Treasury.
Reform Coins are a popular investment, because at the end of a Game
each Player's points are reset to zero, while Group Treasuries retain
their points, seemingly forever.<p>

<li> <strong><a name="blots">Blots</strong>. Blots are not something you
want to have.  Blots are "awarded" for breaking the Rules, or doing
something that awards a point penalty under the Rules.  Blots may be
removed by spending 5 points each, or for serving as a Judge.  No player
possessing a Blot can win the game.<p>

<li> <strong><a name="kudos">Kudos</a></strong>. Kudos are a quantification
of Honour. Honour is a somewhat vague concept with different meanings to
different Players, but it basically is a measure of how well the other
Players like your playing style. Each week every Player can twice transfer one
Kudo from one Player to another Player (NOT emself) by sending notification
of the transfer to the Herald along with a reason for the transfer. An
example:
<pre>
---------------------------- 
Mr. Herald: I hereby transfer one Kudo from Bob, for attempting to become 
Emperor of Nomic, to Joe, who made Proposal 1862, which I really liked.
---------------------------- 
</pre>

Remember that you can only transfer two Kudos per week, and the
two donors and two recipients must all be distinct players.<p>
</ul>

        Points, Marks, Coins, and EV's can be freely traded among Players 
by sending a message to the appropriate recordkeepor. The exception is that
no transfer of Points can be made that would give a Player more than 90% of
the Points that Player would need to win. (i.e. if Bob needs 100 Points to
win, I cannot make a transfer to him that would put his score at more than
90 points.)<p>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter X: The Patent Titles
</h2> 
        As defined in the vocabulary list, a <a href="#pattitle">Patent
Title</a> is a title given to a Player usually as an honor but sometimes
for other reasons. Here is a list of all non-Unique Patent Titles and how
they are awarded.<p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Champion</strong>. Awarded automatically to any Player who
wins a game.  A Player who wins a second game in spite of handicap gets
the title of Champion * H, where H is the handicap amount.<p>

<li> <strong>Degrees</strong>. These are awarded by Vote to Players who
have written an appropriate Thesis; see <a href="#degrees">Degrees and
Theses</a>.<p>

<li> <strong>Hero</strong>. Awarded by Vote to persons who gave "outstanding
service" to Agora Nomic, but are not currently or never were Players. Peter
Suber, the inventor of the concept of Nomic, is the only person to hold
this title so far.<p>

<li> <strong>Scamster</strong>. Awarded by Vote to Players who show skill in
Scamming. What constitutes Scamming is not strictly defined, but generally
involves finding a loophole in the Rules and using it to one's own
benefit.<p>

<li> <strong>Shogun</strong>. Awarded automatically to the Player with the
most Kudos, and at least 40 Kudos.<p>

<li>  <strong>Zeitgeist</strong>. Awarded automatically to the Player who
most recently made a Proposal which passed unanimously.<p>

<li> <strong>Relics</strong>. Some Patent Titles are no longer given out
because the Rules which awarded them have been repealed. The Players who
already had the Titles kept them, though. These include Agoraphobe, for
non-Players who took an active role in Agora, Marxist, for the Player with
the most Marks, and a few others. See the 
<a href="http://www.quincy.edu/~blahedo/agora/registrar">Registrar's report</a>
for a complete listing.
</ul>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter XI: <a name="groups">Groups</a>
</h2> 

        A Group is just that. It is a group of Players who (usually) have a
common purpose or idea of the direction they want Agora to take, although
not all Groups are ideologically homogeneous.<p>

        Each Player can belong to only one Group (or be unaffiliated). 
In the past, Groups were allowed to cast Votes on each Proposal just like 
a Player; this was abolished in January of 1995.

        Each Group has a set of Ordinances, which are like a miniature
Ruleset for that Group. The Group's Ordinances specify how the Group casts
its Votes. Some Groups require their Members' Votes to be cast as a bloc
on certain Proposals (i.e. all <strong>FOR</strong> or all <strong>AGAINST</strong>),
while others split their Votes.<p>

<hr><p><h2>
Chapter XIII: Miscellaneous
</h2> 

<ul>
<li><strong>Oaths</strong>. An Oath is a promise to do something. It must
be made to the Public Forum. An example:
<pre>
---------------------------- 
I, Bob, hereby make an Oath that I will transfer 10 Points to Joe if 
and when he sends a message to the Public Forum expressing his
acceptance of me as Emperor of Agora.
---------------------------- 
</pre>
Oaths used to be legislated and an official part of the game. Even though
they are no longer official, it is still <strong>EXTREMELY</strong> bad
form to break an Oath. Don't do it.<p>

<li><strong>Contests</strong>. Contests are subgames of Agora Nomic,
which allow a number of players to compete for various rewards, etc.,
under the auspices of a Contestmaster. Any player can create a Contest,
by sending its name and regulations to the Public Forum. For example:
<pre>
---------------------------- 
ANNOUNCEMENT OF CONTEST
This announcment creates a Contest named "Bob's Contest" with the
following regulations:

1. The entry fee is 10 points, payable to the Contest Fund.
2. Each Contestant guesses a number between 1 and 100.
3. After one week, the player guessing the largest number not guessed
   by another contestant receives the entire Contest Fund. The Contest
   then dissolves.
---------------------------- 
</pre>
<li><strong><a name="degrees">Degrees and Theses</a></strong>. Degrees are
a kind of academic distinction
awarded for scholarly work in the field of Nomic.  They are awarded
by Vote of the Players upon submission of a Thesis.  A Thesis may be
submitted by, and a degree awarded to, Players or non-Players.
Currently, possible Degrees are Associate of Nomic (A.N.), Bachelor
of Nomic (B.N.), Master of Nomic (M.N.), and Doctor of Nomic (D.N.Phil.).<p>

</ul>

Chapter XIV: Agora History
</h2>

<h3> I. Early History </h3><br>

By Charles E. Carroll: <a href="mailto:ccarroll@students.wisc.edu">
ccarroll@students.wisc.edu</a><p>

        I had been a Player on Nomic World for several months.  In May 1993
I graduated from Illinois, and left there.  In Nomic World I went "On Hold"
(or whatever the NW equivalent was--I think it was "On Vacation") with the
intention of returning from time to time over the summer, and then
full-time once I came to the University of Wisconsin and got an account
here.  I first returned to Illinois in late June 1993 for about a week, and
checking my e-mail, discovered that Nomic World had crashed.<p>

        There was some discussion of ressurecting Nomic World, in the state
it had been in when it crashed, as an e-mail game, but that would have
involved some severe bending (if not breaking) of the Rules, so it was
decided that it would be better to start anew for an e-mail game.<p>

        I wrote the Agora Initial Set essentially as a composite of several
Initial Sets I had.  Peter Suber's original ftf set, the Nomic World
Initial Set, and there was also another Initial Set I had (which I
<em>think</em> was sent to me by Dave Bowen, but I'm not sure)
which was written for e-mail play.  It gave me the idea for the Speaker to
solve what was called "the problem of simultaneity"--i.e. if people gave
their own proposals numbers, we might well end up with duplicated numbers. 
In this Initial Set the Speaker was much more of a "benevolent god," almost
like the Game Master in RPG's, and not really a player.  This seemed, to
me, contrary to the spirit of Nomic so I made the Speaker a Player as well.
 So that the Speaker would not be overwhelmed with additional work that the
Voters added, I gave him the "veto"--i.e. a two-thirds vote was necessary
to make a Rule Change affecting the Speaker's duties which the Speaker did
not approve.  Keep in mind that in the initial set there was no Rulekeepor,
Scorekeepor, or CotC--the Speaker did it all.  (It's true that even with my
initial set, you needed to put a fair amount of trust in your First Speaker
not to act psychotically, but this was much much more so in the pbem
initial set I had.  For this reason, at least to me, the Patent Title of
First Speaker and the retention of Rule 104 in the Ruleset is much more
than just recognizing Michael as the Speaker for the first game--it's also
a sort of "thanks" for behaving benevolently towards the game, saying that
he behaved honourably even though he could have taken all kinds of
liberties within the Rules.)<p>

        I also added in the Initial Set a few things that had been learned
from NW--"Points may not be gained, lost, or traded except as permitted by
the Rules" had not been in any of the other initial sets that I looked at! 
(But it had been added in NW.) Several people gave me helpful comments
during this period--as I said before, Dave Bowen sent me some initial sets,
and Michael Norrish gave some helpful comments as well.  I'm sure there
were other people who contributed as well, but I don't remember who.

        But as I had a little less than a week in Champaign-Urbana to do
this, the Initial Set was still quite rough.  I tried to clean up any major
problems, but I was well aware there were many lesser problems.  "Fix
them!" I said, "from *within* the game!  This <strong>is</strong> Nomic,
after all!" (After all, if an Initial Nomic Set is already an Ideal Set,
it's a pretty boring game of Nomic. :)<p>

        As I said, I was only in contact (netwise) for about a week, so I
couldn't join initially as a Player.  But Michael Norrish agreed to serve
as First Speaker, and the first Game began in late June/early July. I
joined in September 1993, when I got my e-mail account here at
Wisconsin.<p>
 
        The name "Agora" didn't come until much later.  Originally we were
just "Nomic," and in fact had no official name.  (When other netNomics were
first discovered, we were unofficially "yoyo.")<p>

        Incidentally, I still have the Initial Set if anyone wants it, and
I *think* I still have the other initial sets I drew on somewhere.<p>

<h3> II. A Few Great Scams </h3><br>

By Beth Moursand: <a href="mailto:bethmo@microsoft.com">

Here's some history from a Watcher's viewpoint...<p>

Actually, the name Agora was chosen fairly recently.  When this Nomic
started, it was just referred to as Nomic, or sometimes E-Nomic for
electronic or email Nomic.  After the Tabula Nomic got started and there
were rumors of other Nomics starting as well, it became necessary to
distinguish between the various Nomics; since this one ran out of the
"yoyo" machine, it was often referred to as Yoyo.  This offended the sense
of dignity of certain players, so someone -- I think it was Wes, or maybe
Garth, but I'm not at all certain -- took a straw poll for preferred names,
and then proposed a Rule Change making the most popular name, "Agora", into
the official Name of the Game.<p>

The "Walrus scam" was one of the most entertaining bits in the entire
history of Nomic, IMHO -- not for the scam itself, but for the discussion
which followed.  The scam was fairly simple.  A Rule had been passed that
prohibited proposals from directly giving/subtracting points to/from voters
based on their votes for/against that proposal.  The Walrus proposal,
instead, created "happy walruses" and "sad walruses" and awarded them to
those who voted for/against the proposal.  Then, some miniscule amount of
time later (I don't remember the exact figure, but it was a number of
seconds with a large negative exponent), all of the walruses would convert
themselves into positive and negative points and self-destruct.  After the
Walrus proposals passed, some of the more studious members of the populace
pointed out that this time unit was small enough that, due to the
uncertainity principle, the actual numbers of walrusses could not be
determined, according to modern physics.  From there, the discussion became
more and more obscure, including speculation on the "ideal walrus" and
whether an ideal walrus had no hair, or an infinite number of hairs.  The
officer responsible for awarding the points refused to do so until the
question as to whether the walrusses could be measured was settled by CFJ;
this got the originator of the scam so annoyed that e finally quit the game
in disgust.<p>

The CFJ scam was one of Stella?'s.  There was no limit to the number of
CFJ's one player could submit, and there was a point award for returning
judgement, so Stella? conspired with another player to give him the win: 
Stella? transferred some points to eim, and then submitted several hundred
CFJ's, all of which were meaningless, the number calculated to be enough
that the collaborator would receive enough points for judging eis
randomly-allocated portion of them that, added to eis previous score plus
the points transferred from Stella?, it would pass the number needed to
win.<p>

The name Stella? refers to an ancient scam, involving a player named
Stella.  Many of the players at that time accused Stella and the scamster
of being the same person, a convenient alter identity invented to be able
to work the scam.  Both of them hotly disputed this, maintaining to the end
that they were separate people.  More recently, Alice was said to be an
alter identity of Wes, and after Wes and Garth both vanished in similar
ways, there was speculation about them as well. All of these individuals
have stood up for their own reality, but for a while this was sort of a
running gag.<p>

Another bit of history which deserves to be noted so that it won't be
repeated was the "secret word" sweepstakes.  For some reason I can't
understand, many new Nomic players like proposing sweepstakes and lotteries
of various sorts.  One such was proposed and passed, in which the
responsible officer was to pick a "secret word" and the first person to use
that word in a message to the listserver won a prize. A player with too
much initiative and too little common sense posted a large portion of the
dictionary in messages of a hundred words apiece, spamming everyone's
mailboxes and interfering with real world functioning.<p>

There, I hope that's useful.<p>

<h3> III. A Few More Scams </h3><br>

By Ronald Kunne: <a
href="mailto:KUNNE@crnvma.cern.ch">KUNNE@crnvma.cern.ch</a><p>

<h5>The Black Repeals (or Agora at the Brink...)</h5>

The Black Repeals were a Scam to profit from the 2-point award for
proto-proposed Proposals. At the time, that is April 1994, the PP award was
given at the time of distribution of the proposals rather than at the end
of the voting period.<p>

Submitting a large number of PP'ed proposals would therefore give an easy
gain, as the penalty for all those failed proposals would fall only in the
next game.<p>

There was one problem: in April we had limits on the allowed number of
Proposals. The limits were 15 for the number of Proposals up for vote and 7
for the number of proposals that could be submitted by one Player.<p>

The Case of the Black Repeals therefore started with the submission of 165
proto's of the form in the beginning of April:<p>
<pre>
---------------------------- 
           Proto-Proposal
           Repeal a Rule
           Repeal Rule N  (where N ranged of all Mutable Rules)
---------------------------- 
</pre>
These PP's were largely ignored by the Agora Community. However, at the
same time a CFJ was submitted that showed that the proposal limits were
illegal and void. <p>

A couple of days later the CFJ was judged TRUE and the road was clear.
Speaker Garth Rose received 165 proposals and felt himself forced to
distribute those.<p>

The Scamming Player received 330 Points and all hell broke lose.<p>

The reason was that not many Players bothered to vote on these Black
Repeals (TM). But, the Abelians (a Group) conspired to clean up the
Ruleset, by voting unanimously <strong>FOR</strong> the Repeals: they were
accepted.<p>

The Agora community split in at least three camps. There were those
advocating that we should go on with this mutulated Rule set (and mind you,
even the Rules on Proposal Voting were Repealed). Another group prefered an
extraneous solution: either to start over or just ignore the Black Repeals.
A minority tried to invent an emergency proposal just to keep Agora
floating.<p>

Agora no doubt came close to a schism.<p>

However, just in time, someone pointed out that all the Black Repeals all
missed declarations (at that time declarations were required for ALL
proposals) and thus were improperly submitted and shouldn't have been voted
upon. A sigh of relief went up, the community collectively ignored the
Black Repeals (and the 330 Points reward, sulk), but a split was avoided.

<h5>The CFJ Scam (or How to make somebody of your choice Speaker)</h5>

The Nomic World at one time crashed, because somebody submitted a too large
number of CFJ's. The idea has its uses, especially since a rapid Judgment
entitles the Speedy Judge to five Points.<p>

This salary can sometimes be used to win a Game.<p>

The occasion game when the CotC went On Hold and choose another Player
(let's call him M) as his successor. M. immediately was approached by S.,
with a plan to make M. Speaker. Here's how it worked: S. became CotC and
immediately (well sort of, we had server problems in that day and age too)
send out 500 CFJ's, all with randomly chosen Judges. Thirty of those CFJ's
were assigned to Judge M, who immediately replied with preprepared
Judgments.<p>

Bingo. The 30 times 5 Points, plus the 40 that S. had transfered to M.
before the start of the Scam, were sufficient to make M. the next
Speaker.<p>


Only later S. realized the problem with this Scam. Not all Judges replied,
and CFJ's had to reassigned and reassigned and.... ad nauseam.<p>

<em>[ed's note: Hint. The author of this history was nicknamed 'Stella?' at
the time of this scam. The First Speaker of Agora was (and is) named
Michael Norrish. Both these Players are still around today.]</em>


<h3> IV. Late 1994 to Early 1995</h3><br>

By Jeffrey Caruso (elJefe): <a href="mailto:jlc@triple-i.com">jlc@triple-i.com</a><p>

This has been a fairly lively period; many of the concepts appearing
above, such as Extra Votes, Contests, Degrees, Blots, etc. have appeared
during this period.  On the other hand, a number of the old entities
that people had grown used to disappeared, such as Group Votes, the
Vototron, Marks Interest, Stocks, the Proposal Sweepstakes, etc.
Life unfolds.<p>

One of the major themes has been the removal of the "Immutable Rule"
concept from the Ruleset. Now all Rules have "partial mutability",
with a Mutability Index which defines how much precedence they command,
and how hard they are to change.  Also, Rules are no longer renumbered 
when amended.  This is a major change which greatly improves the stability
of the precedence relationships.<p>

Much of the work of crafting the proposals to achieve this has been done 
by the Reform Group, and not all of it has been without controversy.  
In fact "controversy" would pretty well describe this entire period.<p>

Since August, when I started Watching, we've seen several major 
explosions in the Ruleset, and one or two really good scams:<p>

There was the typo in Proposal 1004 which deregistered people after
inactivity of two DAYS (instead of two weeks, as intended).  There
was the Marks Scam in which the scammer used a loophole in the "Game 
Entities May Not Be Arbitrarily Changed" rule to transfer everyone's 
Marks to emself.<p>

There was the time in October when one player attempted to place everyone
On Hold retroactively from the beginning of August, in an attempt
to deregister those players and force their Groups to dissolve.
This provoked quite a bit of discussion but was eventually ruled illegal.<p>

Later, a Group was formed with the purpose of scamming
the Coin laws.  In those days a dissolving group's Coins were automatically
redeemed at 2 points each.  The Millionaires Group was formed very 
briefly, long enough to mint 4,000,000 coins and give them to Timothy.
His 8,000,000+ points were enough to win the Game...<p>

Not all the Rules surprises had to do with deliberate Scams.  In December, 
an innocuous CFJ determined that in fact the Kudo Rule was defective
and did not allow for the transfer of Kudos at all!<p>

Some of our controversies did not directly involve the Ruleset at all.
In November, the pace of the Reform proposals provoked a reaction in the
form of an unofficial and secret group, known as "SLOWDOWN!"  There
was a lot of emotional reaction to the fact that this group used
anonymous mail to broadcast their position, with some Players doubting
that the group really existed, or contained any Players, and others 
debating the propriety of using anonymous remailers.  We even had a 
copycat anon-mailer!  Well, it was interesting for a while...<p>

In December the Speaker (who was also Scorekeepor), claimed overwork
and went On Hold to get rid of the Scorekeeporship.  Eventually e 
abandoned eir position as Speaker, and the Scorekeepor position was 
filled part-time by various people before regular reports resumed in March.<p>

The period since January has been one of great creativity.  After wiping
the slate clean of non-Player voting entites, both old and new Players
began floating various ideas for transferrable votes, new ways of winning 
(besides Points), new ways of NOT winning, and reorganizing the position
of Speaker.  We even had a competition to create an Agora Anthem!<p>

The Extra Vote rule, one of the first fruits of this effort, had a number
of loopholes;  originally it awarded a Player one EV for each proposal on 
which e ABSTAINed.  Sounds reasonable enough, but it actually encouraged
submitted large numbers of frivolous Proposals to give plenty of opportunities
for voting ABSTAIN.<p>

Another amusing loophole was that the limit of 5 EV's per player was 
worded in a way that made it ineffective, and one player
who habitually ABSTAINs on everything managed to get a windfall
of 35 EV's!<p>

A Proposal of my own (Contests) slipped through with even worse loopholes.
My idea was to allow subgames of Agora whose regulations were enforceable
in the Nomic Courts.  What actually resulted was a Frankenstein's monster
in which anyone could be nominated as Contestmaster of a contest against
their will, and subject to its rules!  And this was not the only problem!
Hopefully by the time this is published the rewritten Rule will be in place.<p>

This brief review of some of the recent highlights cannot do justice to the
full range of creativity that players have shown, in trying to construct 
a Nomic Economy, in crafting beautiful theses and outrageous scams, and
in using the Rules as the raw material for making logical pretzels. 
In hopes that the spirit of friendly one-upmanship and logical limit-testing
will continue, I conclude:  long live Agora!<p>
