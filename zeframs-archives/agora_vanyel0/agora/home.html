<center><h1>Agora Nomic</h1></center>

<p>Agora is one specific instance on the net of Peter Suber's
<a href="../nomic.html">Nomic</a>.
Agora Nomic has been continuously played since June 1993.  There have
been thousands of Proposals, and there are hundreds of Rules...
membership seems to hover around twenty Players or so, and more are
always welcome!
</p>

<h2>The Archives</h2>
<p>As Archivist, my job was to, well, keep archives.  And here they are!
Unfortunately, I haven't had the time to really keep up with Agora
lately (like, since mid-1997); I've dropped out of the game (and thus am
not Archivist).  However, I do continue to keep logs of the mailing
lists, because I'm still interested in the game and hope to eventually
rejoin it.

<p>As a result, most of this is out of date.  I'm not going to remove
it, since sometimes out-of-date stuff is better than no stuff at all,
but be aware that except for the mailing lists you can probably find
more up-to-date info elsewhere.  If you have any questions, you can mail
me at <a href="mailto:blahedo@brown.edu">blahedo@brown.edu</a>.

<p><em>Note: Some things may have gotten jumbled in my move to
Brown U.; if so, please send me a quick email and I'll fix it asap.</em>

Items of interest... <i><font size=-1>(Some of these are off-site links,
so I cannot guarantee that they will always be up.)</font></i>
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="logs/index.html">Listserver Logs</a> contain
