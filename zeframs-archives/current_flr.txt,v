The Game of Agora
      A category concerning this nomic generally, constitutional
      matters, and relationships between the most fundamental nomic
      entities.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 101/7 (Power=3)
Agoran Rights and Privileges

      The rules may define persons as possessing specific rights or
      privileges.  Be it hereby proclaimed that no binding agreement
      or interpretation of Agoran law may abridge, reduce, limit, or
      remove a person's defined rights.  A person's defined privileges
      are assumed to exist in the absence of an explicit, binding
      agreement to the contrary.  This rule takes precedence over any
      rule which would allow restrictions of a person's rights or
      privileges.

         i. Every person has the privilege of doing what e wilt.

        ii. Every player has the right to perform an action which is
            not regulated.

       iii. Every person has the right to initiate a formal process to
            resolve matters of controversy, in the reasonable
            expectation that the controversy will thereby be resolved.
            Every person has the right to cause formal reconsideration
            of any judicial determination that e should be punished.

        iv. Every person has the right to refuse to become party to
            a binding agreement.  The absence of a person's explicit,
            willful consent shall be considered a refusal.

         v. Every person has the right to not be considered bound by
            an agreement, or an amendment to an agreement, which e has
            not had the reasonable opportunity to review.

        vi. Every player has the right of participation in the fora.

       vii. Every person has the right to not be penalized more than
            once for any single action or inaction.

      viii. Every player has the right to deregister rather than
            continue to play.

      Please treat Agora right good forever.

[CFJ 24: Players must obey the Rules even in out-of-game actions.]

[CFJ 825 (called 7 November 1995): Players must obey the Rules even if
no Rule says so.]

[CFJ 1848 (called 21 December 2007): The game must operate according
to the rules that prevail at the time, and not attempt to incorporate
any retroactive changes made in the future.]

[CFJ 1709 (called 26 July 2007): The rules are binding on all those
who play the game in the broader sense, regardless of whether they
have the rule-defined status of "player".]

[CFJ 1132: A Player failing to perform a duty required by the Rules
within a reasonable time may be in violation of the Rules, even if the
Rules do not provide a time limit for the performance of that duty.]

[CFJ 1488 (called 11 February 2004): Engineering a situation in which
other players are unable to follow a particular rule is not in itself
a violation of that rule.]

[CFJ 1856 (called 29 December 2007): The requirement that "no
interpretation of Agoran law may abridge ... a person's defined
rights" means that it must be feasible, given the practical limits of
Agoran evidence-gathering, to remain reasonably sure that a person's
defined rights are not being limited.]

[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): The right of participation in the
fora is the right to participate in them for their intended purposes,
and is not necessarily infringed by regulations regarding the manner
and type of participation.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): An obligation on a player to not
publish statements that e believes are true would conflict with the
right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1753 (called 28 September 2007): The right to cease playing
applies only to those who have the rule-defined status of "player",
not to those who play the game in the broader sense without having
that official status.]

Rule 2125/2 (Power=3)
Regulation Regulations

      An action is regulated if:

      a) It is IMPOSSIBLE.

      b) It is ILLEGAL.

      c) The rules explicitly state that it CAN be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action CANNOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.

      d) The rules explicitly state that it MAY be performed while
         certain conditions are satisfied.  Such an action MAY NOT be
         performed except as allowed by the rules.

      e) It would, as part of its effect, modify information for which
         some player is required to be a recordkeepor.  Such an action
         CANNOT modify that information except as allowed by the
         rules.

      f) A judicial finding has determined that it is regulated, and
         has not been superseded by subsequent legislation.

Rule 1586/3 (Power=2)
Definition and Continuity of Entities

      Two Rule-defined entities CANNOT have the same name or nickname.

      If the Rules defining an entity are repealed or amended such
      that they no longer define that entity, then that entity and its
      properties cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they still
      define that entity but with different properties, then that
      entity and its properties continue to exist to whatever extent
      is possible under the new definitions.

[CFJ 1807 (called 25 November 2007): Rule-defined entities include
pending timed events, which can therefore occur under modified rules
even if the events that originally triggered them would not trigger
them under the new rules.]

Rule 1688/4 (Power=3)
Power

      The power of an entity is a non-negative rational number.
      An instrument is an entity with positive power.

      The power of an entity cannot be set or modified except as
      stipulated by the rules.  All entities have power zero except
      where specifically allowed by the rules.

      A rule that secures a change (hereafter the securing rule)
      thereby makes it IMPOSSIBLE to perform that change except as
      allowed by an instrument with power greater than or equal to the
      change's power threshold.  This threshold defaults to the
      securing rule's power, but CAN be lowered as allowed by that
      rule.

          its own.

      (c) modify any other substantive aspect of an instrument with
          power greater than its own.  A "substantive" aspect of
          an instrument is any aspect that affects the instrument's
          operation.

Rule 2149/8 (Power=1)
Truthfulness

      A person SHALL NOT make a public statement unless e believes
      that in doing so e is telling the truth.  Merely quoting a false
      statement does not constitute making it for the purposes of this
      rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause, or other qualifier
      attached to a statement constitutes part of the statement for
      the purposes of this rule; the truth or falsity of the whole is
      what is significant.

[CFJ 1739 (called 29 August 2007): A quotation can result in a
violation of rule 2149, depending on the context of the rest of the
message.]

[CFJ 1849 (called 21 December 2007): Violation of rule 2149 can occur
without any intent to misdirect.]

[CFJ 1887 (called 30 January 2008): Publicly making the statement
"This statement is a lie." would most likely be a violation of rule
2149, because it is logically indeterminate and so making it would not
be telling the truth, and its logical indeterminacy would be
understood by any reasonable player.]

Rule 2186/0 (Power=2)
Victory

      Winning Conditions and Losing Conditions exist only as defined
      by rules.  Defining these things is secured.

      A win announcement is a correct announcement explicitly labeled
      as a win announcement.

      When one or more persons satisfy at least one Winning Condition
      and do not satisfy any Losing Conditions, all such persons win
      the game.  This is the only way to win the game, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Each Winning Condition should (if needed) specify a cleanup
      procedure to prevent an arbitrary number of wins arising from
      essentially the same conditions.  When one or more persons win
      the game, for each Winning Condition satisfied by at least one
      of those persons, its cleanup procedure occurs.

Rule 2110/5 (Power=3)
Win by Paradox

      A tortoise is an inquiry case on the possibility or legality of
      a rule-defined action (actual or hypothetical, but not arising
      from that case itself, and not occurring after the initiation of
      that case) for which the question of veracity is UNDECIDABLE.

      Upon a win announcement that a tortoise has continuously been a
      tortoise for no greater than four and no less than two weeks,
      the initiator satisfies the Winning Condition of Paradox.

      Cleanup procedure:  Each winner satisfying this Winning
      Condition SHALL, as soon as possible, make a reasonable attempt
      to resolve the paradox.  The same person can not satisfy this
      Winning Condition again for the same tortoise or for any other
      tortoise that was linked to it in assignment.

Rule 2199/1 (Power=2)
Ribbons

      Ribbons are a class of fixed assets.  Changes to Ribbon holdings
      are secured.  Ownership of Ribbons is restricted to players.

      Each Ribbon has exactly one color.  Colors with different names
      are distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of
      Ribbon is a currency.

      The Tailor is a low-priority office, and the recordkeepor of
      Ribbons.

      Ribbons are gained as follows, unless the player already
      possesses the color of Ribbon to be gained:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted and changes at least
           one rule with Power >= 3, its proposer gains a Red Ribbon.

      (+O) When an interested proposal is adopted by voting with no
           valid votes AGAINST, its proposer gains an Orange Ribbon.

      (+G) At the end of each month, each player who held at least one
           office continuously during that month gains a Green Ribbon,
           unless e failed to perform an official duty within a time
           limit during that month.

      (+C) When a player deputises for an office, e gains a Cyan
           Ribbon.

      (+B) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question
           other than a question on sentencing, e gains a Blue Ribbon,
           unless e violated a requirement to submit that judgement
           within a time limit.

      (+K) When a player assigns a judgement to a judicial question on
           sentencing, e gains a Black Ribbon, unless e violated a
           requirement to submit that judgement within a time limit.

      (+W) When a first-class person becomes a player for the first
           time, e gains a White Ribbon.  When a first-class person
           has been a player continuously for at least three months,
           was never a player before that period, and names another
           first-class player as eir mentor (and has not named a
           mentor in this fashion before), that player gains a White
           Ribbon.

      (+M) When, during Agora's birthday, a player publicly
           acknowledges the occasion, e gains a Magenta Ribbon.

      (+U) When a player is awarded the Patent Title Champion, e gains
           an Ultraviolet Ribbon.

      (+V) When a player is awarded a Patent Title, e gains a Violet
           Ribbon, unless e gains a different Ribbon for the award.

      (+I) When a player is awarded a degree, e gains an Indigo
           Ribbon.

      (+Y) At the end of each month, for each contest that awarded
           points to at least three different contestants during that
           month, the contestmaster gains a Yellow Ribbon.

      If this rule mentions at least six different specific colors for
      Ribbons, then a player CAN destroy one Ribbon of each such color
      in eir possession to satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Renaissance.

Rule 2177/5 (Power=2)
The Senate

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for
      the immediately preceding sixty days.  The collection of
      Senators is the Senate.  The Registrar's report includes a list
      of all Senators.

      A Senator CAN call an Emergency Session with 2 Senate
      supporters, provided no other emergency session existed at any
      time in the preceding 48 hours.  An emergency session lasts for
      21 days after being called.  The Assessor's report includes the
      most recent date on which an emergency session was called.

      The roll call of an emergency session is the set of senators at
      the time the emergency session was called.  During emergency
      session, the previous definition of senator does not apply;
      instead, any player who is a member of the roll call is a
      senator.  The Assessor's report includes the roll call of the
      most recent emergency session.

      During emergency session, any Senator CAN declare a filibuster
      on a proposal in its voting period, with 2 supporting Senators,
      provided no filibuster has been declared on that proposal in the
      past.  Any Senator CAN end a filibuster on a proposal with 4
      supporting Senators.

      A proposal that ends its voting period in filibuster has a
      quorum of the number of eligible voters plus 1, rules to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      When an emergency session begins, all non-Senators' postures
      become supine, and non-Senators CANNOT flip their posture while
      the session lasts.

Rules
      A category concerning the rules of the game, including the
      processes of changing the rules.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2141/1 (Power=3)
Role and Attributes of Rules

      A rule is a type of instrument with the capacity to govern
      the game generally.  A rule's content takes the form of
      a text, and is unlimited in scope.  In particular, a rule
      may define in-game entities and regulate their behaviour,
      make instantaneous changes to the state of in-game entities,
      prescribe or proscribe certain player behaviour, modify the
      rules or the application thereof, or do any of these things
      in a conditional manner.

      Every rule has power between one and four inclusive.  It is
      not possible for a rule to have a power outside this range.

      Rules have ID numbers, to be assigned by the Rulekeepor.

      Every rule shall have a title to aid in identification.  If a
      rule ever does not have a title, the Rulekeepor shall assign
      a title to it by announcement as soon as possible.

      For the purposes of rules governing modification of instruments,
      the text, power, ID number, and title of a rule are all
      substantive aspects of the rule.

[CFJ 1498 (called 12 April 2004): A rule's title is not strictly a
name for the rule, and so rule titles are not subject to the
uniqueness requirement on names of rule-defined entities.]

Rule 217/6 (Power=3)
Interpreting the Rules

      When interpreting and applying the rules, the text of the rules
      takes precedence.  Where the text is silent, inconsistent, or
      unclear, it is to be augmented by game custom, common sense,
      past judgements, and consideration of the best interests of the
      game.

[CFJ 1139: Interpretations [judgements at the time of CFJ 1139] need
not necessarily accord with the reasoning and arguments of Judges or
Justices given in past CFJs.]

Rule 1482/2 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

      No change to the Ruleset can occur that would cause a Rule
      to stipulate any other means of determining precedence
      between Rules of unequal Power.  This applies to changes by
      the enactment or amendment of a Rule, or of any other form.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would permit
      such a change to the Ruleset.

[CFJ 1103 (called 18 August 1998): In the case of conflict between
Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer to the
lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes precedence
over Rule 1482.]

[CFJ 858 (called 15 February 1996): If a low-Power [low-MI at the time
of Judgement of CFJ 858] Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule
of higher Power to mean something other than its ordinary English
meaning, that may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does
must be decided on a case-by-case basis.]

Rule 1030/6 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower ID number takes
      precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence-determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

[CFJ 1104 (called 20 August 1998): The presence in a Rule of deference
clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does not
prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only how the
Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does arise.]

[CFJs 1114-1115 (called 27 January 1999): This Rule is to be applied
to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just because a Rule
is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict with a Rule of higher
precedence does not mean that the Rule is nullified in all cases.]

Rule 105/3 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The ID number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument; any
          attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes
      that change to be void and without effect.  A variation in
      whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of an existing
      rule does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this
      rule, but any other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 1499 (called 20 April 2004), CFJ 1623 (called 1 April 2007): If a
low-power rule states that an officer can repeal the rule under
certain circumstances, then the rule cannot actually be repealed by
this process, because the officer, not being an instrument, is
categorically incapable of performing rule changes; this is different
from the situation where a rule can be triggered to repeal itself.]

[CFJ 708 (called October 1994): An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is
not a legal Rule Change.]

[CFJ 1625 (called 1 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a rule to
amend by both number and title, and the number and title given
identify different rules, this constitutes ambiguity that nullifies
the attempted rule change.]

[CFJ 1644 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.",
where XXX specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule
changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this
constitutes two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both
attempt to amend the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.",
where both XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two
separate attempts at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form
of words "Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY
specify text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule
change, even though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single
rule amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but
the other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

Rule 1681/12 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      a) The type of change.

      b) The date on which the change took effect.

      c) The mechanism that specified the change.

      d) If the rule was changed due to a proposal, then that
         proposal's ID number, author, and co-author(s) (if any).

Rule 869/25 (Power=1)
How to Join and Leave Agora

      Citizenship is an entity switch with values Unregistered
      (default) and Registered, tracked by the registrar.  A player is
      an entity whose citizenship is Registered.

      The verb "to be registered" means to become a player (i.e., to
      have one's citizenship changed from Unregistered to Registered),
      and the verb "to be deregistered" means to cease to be a player
      (i.e., to have one's citizenship changed from Registered to
      Unregistered).  Where the verb "to register" or "to deregister"
      is used without an explicit direct object, the action is
      implicitly reflexive.

      A person CAN register, unless prevented by the rules, by
      announcing that e registers, wishes to register, requests
      registration, or requests permission to register.

      A player CAN deregister by announcement.  E CANNOT register
      within thirty days after doing so.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person CAN be deregistered by any player by announcement.

[CFJ 1275 (called 19 February 2001): An entity is a Player if the
Rules cannot distinguish that entity from a Player.]

[CFJ 1263 (called 5 February 2001): Any message expressing a clear
desire or intent to register as a Player counts as a request for
registration, whether or not it is explicitly phrased in the manner
stipulated by the rules.]

Limited Partnerships

      A partnership SHALL NOT register if its basis is the same as
      that of any player.  Whenever a judgement of GUILTY is assigned
      in a criminal case alleging that a partnership has violated this
      rule, the judge SHOULD assign an EXILE judgement to the question
      on sentencing in that case.

      If a registered partnership has the same basis as another
      player, any player CAN deregister it with Agoran Consent.

Rule 2139/1 (Power=1)
The Registrar

      The Registrar is an office; its holder is responsible for
      keeping track of players.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each player:

      a) Information sufficient to identify and contact em.
      b) The date on which e most recently became a player.

[CFJ 1703 (called 13 July 2007): A player cannot change eir nickname
by announcement if the new nickname that e specifies is the current
nickname of another player.]

[CFJ 1361 (called 7 May 2002): Purporting to assign a new nickname,
previously unused to refer to any entity, to another player is
successful, but does not displace the target's existing name or
nickname.]

[CFJ 1489 (called 11 February 2004): Watchers are not a rule-defined
element of the game.]

[CFJ 1420 (called 17 December 2002): The list of watchers, customarily
published with the registrar's report, is part of the game state, even
though it is not mentioned in the rules and no one is obliged to track
or publish it.]

[Cross-references (13 February 2008): the Registrar's duties are:
  * report senators (rule 2177)
  * track citizenship (rule 869)
  * report players' identity and contact details (rule 2139)

Rule 1789/3 (Power=1)
Cantus Cygneus

      Whenever a Player feels that e has been treated so egregiously
      by the Agoran community that e can no longer abide to be a part
      of it, e may submit a document to the Clerk of the Courts,
      clearly labeled a Cantus Cygneus, detailing eir grievances and
      expressing eir reproach for those who e feels have treated em so
      badly.

      As soon as possible after receiving a Cantus Cygneus, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall publish this document along with a Writ of
      Fugere Agorae Grandissima Exprobratione, commanding the Player
      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and
      the notation in the Registrar's Report will ensure that,
      henceforth, all may know said Player deregistered in a Writ of
      FAGE.

[CFJ 1594 (called 16 December 2006): Players can be deregistered due
to this rule even if there is no Registrar.]

Activity

      Activity is a player switch with values Active (default) and
      Inactive, tracked by the Registrar.  The Registrar's report
      includes the date on which each non-Active player's activity
      last changed.

      A player CAN flip eir activity by announcement.  "To go on hold"
      is to become Inactive; "to come off hold" is to become Active.

      A player CAN flip another player's activity to Inactive without
      objection.

      A player who has been continuously Inactive for at least three
      months CAN be deregistered by any other player without
      objection.

Definitions

Rule 478/23 (Power=3)
Fora

      Freedom of speech being essential for the healthy functioning of
      any non-Imperial nomic, it is hereby resolved that No Player
      shall be prohibited from participating in the Fora.

      Publicity is a forum switch with values Public, Discussion, and
      Foreign (default), tracked by the Registrar.

      The Registrar's report includes, for each forum with non-Foreign
      publicity, sufficient instructions for players to receive
      messages there.

      The Registrar may change the publicity of a forum without
      objection as long as:

      (a) e sends eir announcement of intent to that forum; and

      (b) if the forum is to be made public, the announcement by which
          the Registrar makes that forum public is sent to all
          existing public fora.

      Each active player should ensure e can receive messages via each
      public forum.

      A message is public if and only if it is sent via a public forum
      or is sent to all players and contains a clear designation of
      intent to be public.  A person "publishes" or "announces"
      something by sending a public message.

      Where the rules define an action that CAN be performed "by
      announcement", a person performs that action by announcing that
      e performs it.  Any action performed by sending a message is
      performed at the time date-stamped on that message.

[CFJs 1451-1452 (called 6 March 2003): A message that is split into
multiple email messages can qualify as a single message for game
purposes, if it is obvious how to combine the parts to reconstruct the
single message.]

[CFJ 752 (called 13 March 1995): Something sent to a Player who is
obligated to send it to all Players is sufficient for sending
something to the PF.]

[CFJ 813 (called 22 October 1995): A Player need not prove that e can
receive the PF.]

[CFJ 831 (called 10 November 1995): The Date: header of a message is
not necessarily the time at which the message takes effect.]

[CFJ 866 (called 8 April 1996): A message is "received" when the
message enters the recipient's normal technical domain of control,
whether this be eir private machine or eir private account on a shared
machine (but not the shared machine itself, if the recipient does not
control it).]

[CFJ 1112: In order to submit a Proposal, in the sense of R1865 and
elsewhere, it is not sufficient that a collection of text 'with the
clear indication that that text is intended to become a Proposal'
(R1483) merely be sent to the Public Forum by a Proposing Entity; the
collection of text must also be received in the Public Forum.]

[CFJ 1314 (called 15 August 2001): If a message sent to a public forum
is rejected by the list moderator, it still qualifies as having been
sent via a public forum.]

[CFJ 1888 (called 31 January 2008): Sending a message to a Discussion
Forum, or other mailing list except for a Public Forum, does not
qualify as sending it to all players.]

[CFJ 1631 (called 29 April 2007): Public announcements must be made in
the message body; the subject line is insignificant.]

[CFJ 1784 (called 5 November 2007): An undescriptive or misleading
subject line does not deprive the message body of effect.]

[CFJ 1880 (called 22 January 2008): A phrase that would, in the
message body, cancel the effect of the rest of the message, does not
have such an effect if it appears in the subject line.]

[CFJ 1761 (called 30 September 2007): Publishing part of a message is
a different action from publishing the whole message.]

[CFJ 1646 (called 30 April 2007): The act of "publishing" or
"announcing" is accomplished when the message has left the sender's
technical domain of control, indicated by one of the "Received:"
headers.]

[CFJ 1695 (called 23 June 2007): A partnership, which by its nature
can't directly send email, can participate in the fora by means of its
members sending messages on its behalf, if its governing agreement
says so.]

[CFJ 1719 (called 12 August 2007): A player can, if e intends, have
public messages sent on eir behalf, including via a web form that
allows all-comers to send messages on eir behalf without specific
approval.]

[CFJs 1833-1834 (called 18 December 2007): A player can, by
contractual arrangement, grant another player the capacity to act by
announcement on eir behalf.]

[CFJ 1893 (called 3 February 2008): A non-consensual non-contractual
arrangement cannot grant a player the capacity to act by announcement
on behalf of another.]

[CFJ 1336 (called 13 December 2001): A public statement that one
wishes to perform an action that one can perform by announcement can
constitute an announcement that performs that action.]

[CFJ 1621 (called 8 February 2007): Where an action can be performed
by announcement, announcing that one deems something to be the case
that would result from that action does not constitute performing the
action.]

[CFJ 1584 (called 24 February 2006), CFJ 1728 (called 20 August 2007):
Saying "I do X 1000 times", where X is something that can be done by
announcement, is an acceptable shorthand for 1000 instances of "I do
X", but this shorthand cannot be used with an infinite repeat count,
because it is impossible to write out an infinite number of instances
of "I do X".]

[CFJ 1774 (called 1 November 2007): Saying "I do X 10000 times", where
X is something that can be done by announcement, does not necessarily
achieve 10000 instances of X, if writing out 10000 instances of "I do
X" would be a substantial effort such that using the shorthand is
abusive.  The presumption is in favour of the shorthand being
successful.]

[CFJ 1775 (called 1 November 2007): If an announcement of the form "I
do X N times" is not be acceptable shorthand for N instances of "I do
X", then the announcement is completely nullified, and does not have
the effect of M instances of "I do X" for any non-zero repeat count
M.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): An appropriate announcement will
accomplish an action even if its author believed the action was
impossible.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): A message-based action cannot be
retroactive.]

Clarity of Announcements

Who Am I?

      self-ratifying, unless the claim is self-contradictory, or a
      challenge of identity pertaining to the claimed publisher has
      been issued within one month before its publication.

      The Executor of a public message is the first-class person who
      sends it, or who most directly and immediately causes it to be
      sent.  The executor of an action performed by announcement is
      the executor of the announcement.

Rule 754/7 (Power=3)
Definition Definitions

      Regularity of communication being essential for the healthy
      function of any nomic, it is hereby resolved:

      (1) A difference in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the use of
          a synonym or abbreviation in place of a word or phrase, is
          inconsequential in all forms of communication, as long as
          the difference does not create an ambiguity in meaning.

      (2) A term explicitly defined by the Rules by default has that
          meaning, as do its ordinary-language synonyms not explicitly
          defined by the rules.

      (3) Any term primarily used in mathematical or legal contexts,
          and not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule, by
          default has the meaning it has in those contexts.

      (4) Any term not addressed by previous provisions of this Rule
          by default has its ordinary-language meaning.

      This rule takes precedence over any other rules which dictate
      terminology or grammar.

[CFJ 1439 (called 20 February 2003): A difference in language
qualifies as a difference in dialect; it is possible to take game
actions by messages in languages other than English.]

[CFJ 1460 (called 4 April 2003): If a message is in a language other
than English, and its intended audience does not understand the
language, this constitutes gross unclarity that makes the message
ineffective.]

[CFJ 712: Referring to a Player by a method other than eir name or
nickname is acceptable, as long as it is unambiguous.]

[CFJ 1861 (called 8 January 2008): A player's legal name (legal in eir

Rule 2152/4 (Power=3)
Mother, May I?

      The following terms are defined.  These definitions are used
      when a rule includes a term in all caps, and SHOULD be used when
      a rule includes a term otherwise.  Earlier definitions take
      precedence over later ones.  If a rule specifies one or more
      persons in connection with a term, then the term applies only to
      the specified person(s).

      1. CANNOT, IMPOSSIBLE, INEFFECTIVE, INVALID:  Attempts to
         perform the described action are unsuccessful.

      2. MUST NOT, MAY NOT, SHALL NOT, ILLEGAL, PROHIBITED: Performing
         the described action violates the rule in question.

      3. SHOULD NOT, DISCOURAGED, DEPRECATED:  Before performing the
         described action, the full implications of performing it
         should be understood and carefully weighed.

      4. CAN: Attempts to perform the described action are successful.

      5. MAY: Performing the described action does not violate the
         rule in question.

      6. MUST, SHALL, REQUIRED, MANDATORY:  Failing to perform the
         described action violates the rule in question.

      7. SHOULD, ENCOURAGED, RECOMMENDED:  Before failing to perform
         the described action, the full implications of failing to
         perform it should be understood and carefully weighed.

Rule 1023/23 (Power=2)
Common Definitions

      The following terms are defined:

      (a) The phrases "in a timely fashion" and "as soon as possible"
          mean "within seven days".

      (b) The term "paragraph" means a subset of text determined as
          follows:

          (1) Each bulleted or enumerated (hereafter simply
              "bulleted") section is a unit of text.

          (2) Any remaining text is divided into units at blank lines.

          (3) Each unit of a document has a level as follows.  All
              unbulleted units have level 1.  Each bulleted unit has
              level n+2, where n is the number of bulleted units it is
              nested inside.

          (4) A barrier between two units is a unit appearing between
              those units which has level no greater than that of the
              unit appearing first.

          (5) The units of a document form an ordered tree, with the
              hierarchy determined as follows.  The root is an empty
              unit with level zero, which nominally appears at the
              beginning of the document.  One unit is a descendant of
              another unit if it appears after the latter, has
              strictly greater level, and is not separated from the
              latter by a barrier.  The tree's ordering follows the
              order of the units in the document.

          (6) A "paragraph" identified by partial quotation is
              determined by the minimum sub-tree containing the
              entirety of that quotation.

          (7) A "paragraph" identified by an ordinal n is determined
              by the nth unbulleted unit and its descendants.

          (8) A "paragraph" identified by enumerated section labels is
              determined by the sub-tree arrived at by traversal from
              the root, using the specified series of labels.

      (c) Agoran epochs:

          (1) Agoran days begin at midnight UTC.

          (2) Agoran weeks begin at midnight UTC on Monday.

          (3) Agoran months begin at midnight UTC on the first day of
              each Gregorian month.

          (4) Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January,
              April, July, and October begin.

          (5) Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
              begins.

Rule 2161/2 (Power=2)
ID Numbers

      If a rule defines a type of entity as having ID numbers, then:

      (a) Whenever an instance of that type does not have an ID
          number, the player held responsible by that rule SHALL
          assign an ID number to it by announcement as soon as
          possible.

      (b) Such an assignment is INVALID unless the number is a natural
          number (expressed as a decimal literal with at most 14
          digits) distinct from any ID number, and greater than any
          orderly ID number, previously assigned to an entity of that
          type.  The player SHALL select the smallest number possible,
          unless e reasonably believes that selecting any smaller
          number might be invalid or confusing.

      (c) Each ID number is either orderly (default) or chaotic.  Upon
          a judicial finding that the assignment of an ID number was
          ILLEGAL, the ID number becomes chaotic.

      (d) Once assigned, an ID number cannot be changed.

      (e) If an office is responsible for assigning ID numbers, then
          that officer's report includes the greatest orderly ID
          number, and a list of all chaotic ID numbers, previously
          assigned to the type of entity.

Rule 2146/1 (Power=2)
Indices

      Indices are elements of the extended real numbers, which is a
      total order consisting of the real numbers plus a minimum
      element, called negative infinity, and a maximum element, called
      positive infinity or unanimity.

      The ratio of a positive index to zero is positive infinity.  The
      ratio of a negative index to zero is negative infinity.  The
      ratio of zero to any index is zero.

Rule 2162/1 (Power=2)
Switches

      A type of switch is a property that the rules define as a
      switch, and specify the following:

      a) The type(s) of entity possessing an instance of that switch.
         No other entity possesses an instance of that switch.

      b) One or more possible values for instances of that switch,
         exactly one of which is designated as the default.  No other
         values are possible for instances of that switch.

      c) Exactly one officer who tracks instances of that switch.
         That officer's report includes the value of each instance of
         that switch whose value is not its default value.

      At any given time, each instance of a switch has exactly one
      possible value for that type of switch.  If an instance of a
      switch comes to have a value, it ceases to have any other value.
      If an instance of a switch would otherwise fail to have a
      possible value, it comes to have its default value.

      "To flip an instance of a switch" is to make it come to have a
      given value.  "To become X" (where X is a possible value of
      exactly one of the subject's switches) is to flip that switch to
      X.

Rule 2150/3 (Power=3)
Personhood

      A person is an entity that has the general capacity to be the
      subject of rights and obligations under the rules.  An entity is
      a person if and only if it is defined to be so by rules with
      power 2 or greater.

      Any biological organism that is capable of communicating by
      email in English is a person.

      "First-class person" means a person of a biological nature.

      "First-class player" means a player who is a first-class person.

      The basis of a first-class person is the singleton set
      consisting of that person.

[CFJ 1700 (called 10 July 2007): The requirement of capability to
communicate by email can be satisfied even if the players of Agora do
not know the organism's email address.]

[CFJ 1685 (called 31 May 2007): Being in a mindless job (e.g.,
keyboard, stenographer, spokesman) may create a rebuttable presumption

Rule 2166/5 (Power=2)
Assets

      An asset is an entity defined as such by an instrument or
      contract (hereafter its backing document), and existing solely
      because its backing document defines its existence.

      Each asset has exactly one owner.  If an asset would otherwise
      lack an owner, it is owned by the Lost and Found Department.  If
      an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a class
      of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or transferred
      to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if it is owned
      by an entity outside that class (except for the Lost and Found
      Department, in which case any player CAN transfer or destroy it
      without objection).

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
      such by its backing document.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  This
      portion of that entity's report is self-ratifying.

      An asset whose backing document is not a rule generally CAN be
      created by its recordkeepor by announcement, subject to
      modification by its backing document.  To "gain" an asset is to
      have it created in one's possession; to "award" an asset to an
      entity is to create it in that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be destroyed by its owner by
      announcement, and an asset owned by the Lost and Found
      Department generally CAN be destroyed by its recordkeepor by
      announcement, subject to modification by its backing document.
      To "lose" an asset is to have it destroyed from one's
      possession; to "revoke" an asset from an entity is to destroy it
      from that entity's possession.

      An asset generally CAN be transferred by its owner to another
      entity by announcement, subject to modification by its backing
      document.  A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing
      document, and CANNOT be transferred; any other asset is liquid.

      A currency is a class of asset defined as such by its backing
      document.  Instances of a currency with the same owner are
      fungible.

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): The self-ratifying asset
report is the complete list of ownerships of assets of that class; a
partial list does not self-ratify.]

[CFJ 1850 (called 22 December 2007): The general ability of the
recordkeepor to create assets does not include an ability to determine
who possesses them when created, so they are necessarily owned by the
Lost and Found Department [at the time of CFJ 1850, the Bank] upon
creation.]

[Note (11 March 2008): The existence of this rule is in question due
to a scam.  See CFJ 1914.]

Rule 2181/3 (Power=1)
The Accountor

      The Accountor is a low-priority office; its holder is
      responsible for keeping track of miscellaneous assets.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets that do
      not specify a different recordkeepor.  If any such assets exist,
      then the Accountor's report includes a list of their backing
      documents; otherwise, the Accountor has no report.

      The Accountor is the default recordkeepor for all assets whose
      backing document does not specify a different recordkeepor.

[Cross-references (28 May 2008): the Accountor's duties are:
  * report classes of assets (rule 2181)

Rule 1728/19 (Power=2)
Dependent Actions

      A player CAN perform an action dependently (a dependent action)
      if and only if the Rules explicitly authorize the player to
      perform the action by one of the following methods:

      - Without N Objections, where N is a nonnegative integer;
      - With N Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer; or
      - With N Agoran Consent, where N is an integer multiple of 0.1,
        with a minimum of 1.0.

      The phrase "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1
      Objection"; the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter"; the phrase "With Agoran Consent" is synonymous with
      "With 1.0 Agoran Consent".

      A player authorized to perform a dependent action (the
      initiator) CAN publicly announce eir intent to do so,
      unambiguously describing both the action and the method,
      including the required value for N.  A player (the performer)
      CAN perform a previously unambiguously described dependent
      action by announcement, if and only if all of the following are
      true:

      (a) the time elapsed since the announcement of intent is no more
          than fourteen days, and (if the action is to be performed
          Without N Objections or With N Agoran Consent) at least four
          days;

      (b) either the performer was the initiator, or the action
          depends on support and the performer has supported the
          action and the rule allowing the action to be performed
          dependently does not explicitly prohibit supporters from
          performing it, or the initiator was authorized to perform
          the action by virtue of holding a rules-defined position and
          the performer is the holder of that position when e attempts
          to perform the action; and

      (c) At the time the action is attempted, Agora is Satisfied with
          the announced intent, as described elsewhere.

      The specification in the rules that an action may be performed
      dependently does not prohibit performing that action
      independently if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): The method of dependent action need
not be described exactly: an approximate but inexact description
suffices, as does the rule-defined term.]

[CFJ 1802 (called 19 November 2007): The phrase "by Agoran Support" is
not an unambiguous description of a method of dependent action.]

Rule 2124/7 (Power=2)
Agoran Satisfaction

      A Supporter of a dependent action is a first-class player who
      has publicly posted (and not withdrawn) support for an
      announcement of intent to perform the action.  An Objector to a
      dependent action is a first-class player (or other person
      explicitly allowed to object to that action by the rule allowing
      that action to be performed dependently) who has publicly posted
      (and not withdrawn) an objection to the announcement of intent
      to perform the action.

      The Executor of such an announcement of intent CANNOT support
      nor object to it.  A rule authorizing the performance of a
      dependent action may further restrict the eligibility of players
      to support or object to that specific action.

      Agora is Satisfied with an intent to perform a specific action
      if and only if:

      (1) the action is to be performed Without N Objections, and it
          has fewer than N objectors;

      (2) the action is to be performed With N supporters, and it has
          N or more supporters; or

      (3) the action is to be performed with N Agoran Consent, and the
          ratio of supporters to objectors is greater than N, or the
          action has at least one supporter and no objectors.

Rule 1769/7 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time designated as such by the Rules.

      During a Holiday, the Promotor SHALL NOT distribute any
      proposals, and judges SHALL NOT be assigned to any judicial
      case, and judges SHALL NOT assign judgement to any judicial
      question.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event (including the
      time limit to perform an action) upon the time of another event,
      and

      a) that other event occurs during a Holiday, then the time at
         which that Holiday ends shall be used instead for the purpose
         of determining the time of the future event.

      b) the future event would occur during a Holiday, then the
         future event occurs 72 hours after the end of that Holiday
         instead.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require events to be
      performed before a specified time.

      The period each year from midnight GMT on the morning of 24
      December to the beginning of the first Agoran week to begin
      after 2 January is a Holiday.

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The registration of a player is an
event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1434 (called 24 January 2003): The expiration of a rule-defined
period is an event for the purposes of rule 1769.]

[CFJ 1480 (called 5 January 2004): An automatic event specified to
occur at regular calendar intervals, for example quarterly, happens at
its specified time even if that is during a holiday.]

Offices
      A category concerning administrative positions held by persons
      within the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1006/25 (Power=2)
Offices

      A role is an office if and only if it is so defined by the
      rules.  Each office at any time either is vacant (default) or is
      filled (held) by exactly one player.  The holder of an office is
      an officer, and may be referred to by the name of the office.

      An office is imposed if it is so described by the rule defining
      it; otherwise, it is elected.

      The holder of an elected office CAN resign it by announcement,
      causing it to become vacant.  As soon as possible after an
      elected office becomes (or is created) vacant, the IADoP SHALL
      make at least one nomination for the office; this requirement is
      waived if another player so makes a nomination.

[CFJ 1660 (called 13 May 2007): This rule does not define the meaning
of the term "office", in the sense meant by rule 754, but rather
references the usual English definition of "office" and governs
offices as thus defined.]

[CFJ 1702 (called 12 July 2007): A requirement to submit something to
an officer is satisfied by publishing it, even if that office is
vacant at the time.]

Rule 2154/11 (Power=2)
Replacing Officers

      Any player CAN by announcement nominate one or more active
      players to be candidate(s) for an elected Office. This begins a
      nomination period for that office, during which other candidates
      may be so nominated.  The nomination period lasts for four days.
      Once a nomination period begins, a new one CANNOT begin for the
      same office until the nomination or resulting election is resolved.
      A player who has not refused eir nomination is a consenting
      candidate.

      As soon as possible after the nomination period ends, then: (a) if
      there is only one consenting candidate, the IADoP SHALL install em
      in the Office by announcement; (b) if there are two or more
      consenting candidates, then the IADoP SHALL initiate an Agoran
      decision to determine the new officeholder; this process is known
      as an election.

      In an election, the valid options are the consenting nominees
      (hereafter the candidates), quorum is the lesser of three and
      the number of active players (other rules on quorum
      notwithstanding), the eligible voters are the active players.
      If a player refuses eir nomination during the election, e
      ceases to be a valid option.

      In the notice resolving the decision, the IADoP will select a
      candidate that received at least as many votes as any other
      candidate (if any); this candidate thereby becomes the
      officeholder.

      Stability is an elected office switch, tracked by the IADoP,
      with values Temporal (default) and Perpetual.  Any player CAN
      flip an office's stability without 2 objections.  A Perpetual
      office becomes Temporal when its holder leaves office.

      If an office is Temporal at the end of a quarter, and no nomination
      period began for that office during that quarter, then the IADoP
      SHALL make at least one nomination for the office during the
      following quarter.  These requirements are waived if another
      player so makes a nomination.

         it at least once each week.  If any information is defined by
         the rules as part of that office's weekly report, then the
         holder of that office SHALL maintain all such information,
         and the publication of all such information is part of that
         office's weekly duties.

      b) If any task is defined by the rules as part of that office's
         monthly duties, then the holder of that office SHALL perform
         it at least once each month.  If any information is defined
         by the rules as part of that office's monthly report, then
         the holder of that office SHALL maintain all such
         information, and the publication of all such information is

      Any information defined by the rules as part of an office's
      report, without specifying which one, is part of its weekly
      report (unless the office is defined by the rules as
      low-priority, in which case it is part of its monthly report).

Rule 2202/0 (Power=3)
Ratification Without Objection

      An official document is a public document purported to be part
      (possibly all) of an official report; this part is the
      document's scope.  Any player CAN, without objection, ratify an
      official document, specifying its scope.  The date of this
      ratification and the scope of the ratified document become part
      of the official report in question, until the same scope is
      ratified at a later date.

[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): Ratification of an official
document affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to
be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list
of players.]

Rule 2201/0 (Power=3)
Self-Ratification

      Any public document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is
      ratified one week after its publication, unless explicitly and
      publicly challenged during that period via one of the following
      methods, explaining the scope and nature of the perceived error:

      a) An inquiry case, appropriate for questions of legal
         interpretation.

      b) A claim of error, appropriate for matters of fact.  The
         publisher of the original document SHALL respond to a claim
         of error as soon as possible, either publishing a revision or
         denying the claim.  If e denies the claim, then the original
         document is ratified one week after the denial, unless it is
         challenged again (subject to the same requirements) during
         that period.

[CFJ 1690 (called 19 June 2007): A challenge to a self-ratifying
document [at the time of CFJ 1690, the resolution of an Agoran
decision] must explicitly identify the document, either individually
or as part of a set, and explicitly contest the accuracy of some
aspect of it.]

[CFJs 1790-1791 (called 11 November 2007): A challenge to any part of

Rule 2160/3 (Power=1)
Deputisation

      Any player (a deputy) CAN perform an action as if e held a
      particular office (deputise for that office) if:

      (a) the rules require the holder of that office, by virtue of
          holding that office, to perform the action (or, if the
          office is vacant, would so require if the office were
          filled); and

      (b) a time limit by which the rules require the action to be
          performed has expired; and

      (c) the deputy announced between two and fourteen days earlier
          that e intended to deputise for that office for the purposes
          of the particular action; and

      (d) it would be POSSIBLE for the deputy to perform the action,
          other than by deputisation, if e held the office.

[CFJ 1776 (called 1 November 2007): A requirement to perform an
action, for the purposes of this rule, can be a logical implication
from rules and circumstances, not just directly imposed by the rules.]

Rule 107/9 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  This notice is invalid if it lacks
      any of the following information, and the lack is correctly
      identified within one week after the notice is published:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the adoption of
          proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) A clear indication of the options available.

      (d) The identity of the vote collector.

      (e) Any additional information defined by the rules as essential
          parameters.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, the
      voting period for a decision cannot be shorter than seven days.

[CFJ 1650 (called 6 May 2007): The intent to initiate the decision and
the information required in the notice need not be explicit.]

[CFJ 1743 (called 18 September 2007): If the notice does not mention
voter eligibility but the type of Agoran decision is clear and the
rule defining the relevant type of Agoran decision fully determines
the class of eligible voters, then the notice thereby implicitly
describes the class of eligible voters.]

[CFJ 1722 (called 15 August 2007): Information that is explicitly
presented in the notice takes precedence over any information that
would be implicit, even where the explicit information is inaccurate
and the implicit information would have been accurate.]

[CFJ 1651 (called 6 May 2007): If a R107 notice initiating an Agoran
decision does not contain an explicit list of the eligible voters, and
there is later a dispute (evidenced by submission of a CFJ) over which
voters were eligible at that time, then the notice's description of
the class of eligible voters was necessarily insufficient to enable
public agreement on which persons are eligible.]

[CFJ 1652 (called 6 May 2007): The set of eligible voters on an Agoran
decision can change during its voting period.]

Rule 683/14 (Power=3)
Voting on Agoran Decisions

      An eligible voter on a particular Agoran decision submits a
      ballot to the vote collector by publishing a valid notice
      indicating which one of the available options e selects.  To be
      valid, the ballot must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) The ballot is submitted during the voting period for the
          decision, and the submitter is an eligible voter at the
          time of submission.

      (b) The ballot clearly identifies the matter to be decided.

      (c) The ballot clearly identifies the option selected by the
          voter.

      (d) The voter has not publicly retracted the ballot during the
          voting period.

      Among the otherwise-valid votes on an Agoran decision, only the
      first N submitted by each entity are valid, where N is the
      entity's voting limit on that decision.  The voting limit of an
      entity that is not an eligible voter on an Agoran decision is
      zero.  The voting limit of an eligible voter on an Agoran
      decision is one, except where rules say otherwise.

      The strength of an option is the number of valid ballots
      selecting that option.

      Other rules may place further constraints on the validity of
      ballots.  This rule takes precedence over any rule that would
      loosen the constraints specified by this rule.

[CFJ 1609 (called 13 January 2007): To "clearly identif[y] the matter
to be decided" does not necessarily require specifying it in detail.]

[CFJs 1852-1853 (called 23 December 2007): Claiming to submit more
votes than ones voting limit on the decision does not constitute the
making of a false statement.]

Rule 2127/2 (Power=1)
Conditional Votes

      A ballot option (vote) on an Agoran decision may be submitted
      conditionally, and the truth or falsity of the condition and
      thus the selected option will be determined as it exists at the
      end of the voting period.

      The option selected shall be considered to be clearly identified
      if and only if the truth or falsity of the specified
      condition(s) can be reasonably determined, without circularity
      or paradox, from information published within the voting period.

      Casting a vote endorsing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is the same as the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.

      Casting a vote denouncing another voter is equivalent to
      conditionally casting a vote whose value is opposite to the most
      common value (if any) among that voter's valid votes on that
      decision.  FOR and AGAINST are opposites; PRESENT is its own
      opposite.

Rule 2168/0 (Power=1)
Extending the voting period

      Whenever the voting period of an Agoran decision would end, and
      the result would be FAILED QUORUM, the length of the voting
      period for that decision will immediately be doubled, provided
      this has not already happened for the decision in question.

      Upon such an occurrence, the vote collector for the decision
      SHOULD issue a humiliating public reminder to the slackers who
      have not yet cast any votes on it despite being eligible.

Rule 208/7 (Power=3)
Resolving Agoran decisions

      The vote collector for an unresolved Agoran decision CAN resolve
      it by announcement, indicating the option selected by Agora.  If
      it was required to be initiated, then e SHALL resolve it as soon
      as possible after the end of the voting period.  To be valid,
      this announcement must satisfy the following conditions:

      (a) It is published after the voting period has ended.

      (b) It clearly identifies the matter to be resolved.

      (c) It specifies which option was selected by Agora, as
          described elsewhere, and provides a tally of the voters'
          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision has exactly one vote collector, defaulting
      to the initiator of the decision.  If the vote collector is
      defined by reference to a position (or, in the default case, if
      the initiator was so defined), then the vote collector is the
      current holder of that position.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would provide
      another mechanism by which an Agoran decision may be resolved.

[CFJ 1711 (called 1 August 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via a References: header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does not qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1810 (called 28 November 2007): If a purported resolution notice
refers via an approximate date header to a previous notice with an
incomplete vote tally and lists additional votes but does not give
revised totals, this does qualify as including a vote tally.]

[CFJ 1822 (called 4 December 2007): If a purported resolution notice
includes invalid votes in its tally of votes, this makes the notice
invalid.]

Rule 2196/1 (Power=3)
Standard Classes of Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision with an adoption index is either ordinary or
      democratic.  An Agoran decision with an adoption index greater
      than or equal to 2 is democratic.  Any other Agoran decision
      with an adoption index is ordinary by default.

      If an Agoran decision has an adoption index, then the following
      are essential parameters:

      a) Its adoption index.
      b) Whether it is ordinary or democratic.

      For any Agoran decision with an adoption index, the available
      options are FOR, AGAINST, and PRESENT.

Rule 955/13 (Power=3)
Determining the Will of Agora

      The outcome of an Agoran decision is determined as follows.

      (a) If there is more than one available option, and the number
          of distinct voters who submitted valid ballots is less than
          quorum, then the outcome is FAILED QUORUM, regardless of the
          remainder of this rule.  Otherwise, the decision achieved
          quorum.

      (b) If the decision is ordinary or democratic, then the voting
          index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to the strength of
          AGAINST.  If the voting index is greater than 1, and greater
          than or equal to the decision's adoption index, then the
          outcome is ADOPTED; otherwise, the outcome is REJECTED.

[CFJs 1673-1675 (called 20 May 2007): Quorum for an Agoran decision is

      This does not prevent amendment of the rules governing the
      validity of votes on Agoran decisions in general.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, votes on it CANNOT be
      validly submitted or retracted, and its outcome CANNOT be
      changed in any way, rules to the contrary notwithstanding.  This
      does not prevent correcting errors in reporting its resolution.

      A public document purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.

Proposals
      A category concerning the primary and plenipotent system by
      which changes are made to the game.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 106/13 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A player submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal, which
      places the proposal in the Proposal Pool.  That player is its
      author (syn. proposer).  The author of a proposal may remove it
      from the Pool by announcement.

      A person is a co-author of a proposal if and only if e is
      distinct from its author, and unambiguously identified by its
      author as being its co-author at the time of submission.

      The adoption index of a proposal is an integral multiple of 0.1
      from 1.0 to 9.9.  It may be set by the proposer at the time of
      submission, or otherwise defaults to 1.0.

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the adoption index is the adoption index of
      the proposal, and the vote collector is the Assessor.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.

      Preventing a proposal from taking effect is a secured change.
      This rule takes precedence over any rule which would permit a
      proposal to take effect.

[CFJ 1647 (called 30 April 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the heading "Proposal:" and a title can be sufficient to clearly
indicate that it is intended to become a proposal, but is not if it
can be interpreted as quoting an existing proposal.]

[CFJ 1717 (called 8 August 2007): Preceding a proposal-like text with
the question "What is the title of this proposal?" can be sufficient
to clearly indicate that it is intended to become a proposal.]

[CFJ 1885 (called 26 January 2008): "AGAINT" is a variant spelling of
"AGAINST", not a customary synonym for "FOR", despite its former
private usage with the latter meaning.]

[CFJ 1639 (called 29 April 2007): Where a proposal attempts two
separate amendments of the text of the same rule, if one of the
attempted amendments is not possible and the other is then the
possible amendment does in fact occur, unless the proposal explicitly
requires a different resolution.]

[CFJ 1781 (called 4 November 2007): Proposal distribution is not
governed by this rule, so for the promotor to distribute a proposal
that is not in the proposal pool is not a violation of this rule.]

[CFJ 1841 (called 20 December 2007): It is possible for a proposal to
have retroactive effect.]

Rule 2153/1 (Power=1)
Interest Index

      The interest index of a proposal is an integer from 0 to 3.  It
      CAN be set by the proposer at the time of submission, or
      otherwise defaults to 1.  A proposal's interest index SHOULD be
      proportional to its complexity.

      "Disinterested" is a synonym for "interest index 0".  A proposal
      SHOULD be disinterested if and only if its effects are limited
      to correcting errors and/or ambiguities.

Rule 1607/18 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor MAY distribute a proposal in the Proposal Pool at
      any time.  The Promotor's weekly duties include the distribution
      of each proposal that has been in the Proposal Pool since the
      beginning of that week.

      The Promotor distributes a proposal by publishing it with the
      clear intent of distributing it.  When a proposal is
      distributed, it is removed from the Proposal Pool.  The
      distribution of a proposal initiates the Agoran decision of
      whether to adopt the proposal, as described elsewhere.

      For an Agoran decision of whether to adopt a proposal, the
      following are essential parameters:

      a) Its author (and co-authors, if any).
      b) Its interest index.

      Distributed proposals have ID numbers, to be assigned by the
      Promotor.

      The Promotor's report includes a list of all proposals in the
      Proposal Pool.

[CFJ 1546 (called 14 April 2005), CFJ 1669 (called 16 May 2007): If a
proposal is purportedly distributed with a text that differs from the
submitted text, this constitutes a legal distribution of the submitted
proposal if and only if the difference does not affect the meaning of
the proposal.]

[CFJ 1655 (called 9 May 2007): Distributing a purported proposal whose
text consists of the texts of two submitted proposals and separating
matter from the message that submitted them both, if both submitted
proposals have non-null effects, does not constitute a legal distribution
of either of the submitted proposals.]

[CFJ 1656 (called 9 May 2007): If the Promotor purports to distribute
a proposal, but the distributed text does not match any proposal in
the proposal pool, this constitutes the effective (albeit prohibited)
distribution of a new proposal.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor creates a new
proposal by distribution, by accidentally mangling the text of a
proposal in the pool, and the new proposal is very similar in meaning
to the one on which it is based (with only inconsequential
differences), then the author of the new proposal is the author of the
proposal on which it is based.]

[CFJ 1780 (called 4 November 2007): If the Promotor accidentally
creates a new proposal by distribution, and the new proposal is
seriously different from any proposal in the pool, then the new
proposal has no author.]

[Cross-references (2 August 2007): the Promotor's duties are:
  * not distribute proposals during holiday (rule 1769)
  * distribute proposals (rule 1607)
  * manage ID numbers of distributed proposals (rule 1607)
  * report proposal pool (rule 1607)]

Rule 2156/6 (Power=2)
Voting on Ordinary Decisions

      Each player has an associated number known as eir base voting
      limit on ordinary decisions (BVLOD).  The BVLOD of a first-class
      player is four, the BVLOD of a province is four, and the BVLOD
      of any other player is zero.  BVLOD cannot be modified.

      Each player has an associated number known as eir volatile
      voting limit on ordinary decisions (VVLOD).  Whenever a player
      is registered, eir VVLOD is set to eir BVLOD.  Changes to VVLOD
      are secured

      Each player has an associated number known as eir effective
      voting limit on ordinary decisions (EVLOD).  Whenever a player
      is registered, eir EVLOD is set to eir BVLOD.  At the end of
      each week, each player's EVLOD is set to eir VVLOD, rounded to
      an integer, breaking ties towards odd integers, and eir VVLOD is
      set to the same rounded value.  EVLOD cannot be modified by any
      other means.  The assessor's report includes each player's
      EVLOD.

      The eligible voters on an ordinary decision are those entities
      that were active players at the start of its voting period.  The
      voting limit of an eligible voter on an ordinary decision is eir
      EVLOD at the start of its voting period, or half that (rounded
      up) if the voter is in the chokey at the start of the voting
      period.

Rule 2134/4 (Power=2)
Win by Clout

      Upon a win announcement that a specified player's voting limit
      on an ordinary decision initiated at that time would exceed the
      combined voting limits of all other players on that decision,
      the specified player satisfies the Winning Condition of Clout.

      Cleanup procedure:  Each player's VVLOD is set to eir BVLOD, and
      no player satisfies this Winning Condition again (the remainder
      of this rule notwithstanding) until after the next time that
      each player's EVLOD is set based on eir VVLOD.

Rule 2126/55 (Power=2)
Notes

      Notes are a class of fixed assets.  Ownership of Notes is
      restricted to players.  Changes to Note holdings are secured.

      Each Note has exactly one pitch from the chromatic scale
      (ignoring octaves, and treating enharmonics as equivalent).
      Each pitch of Note is a currency.

      The Conductor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Notes.

      Key is a player switch, tracked by the Conductor, with values
      equal to the pitches that Notes can have, defaulting to C.  A
      player CAN change eir Key to any value by announcement, unless e
      has already done so during the current month.

      Notes are gained as follows, except that the pitch actually
      gained is as many semitones higher than the pitch listed below
      as the player's Key is higher than C at the time of the gain:

      (1) At the end of each week, for each player, let X be the
          number of eir interested proposals that were adopted during
          that week, and let Y be the number of eir interested quorate
          proposals that were rejected during that week with VI >=
          AI/2:

          (F)  If X > Y > 0, then e gains an F Note.
          (F#) If X > Y = 0, then e gains an F# Note.
          (G)  If X = Y > 0, then e gains a G Note.
          (Ab) If Y > X = 0, then e gains an Ab Note.
          (A)  If Y > X > 0, then e gains an A Note.

      (2) (E)  At the end of each week, each player who completed the
               non-empty set of weekly duties of at least one office
               during that week gains an E Note.

          (Eb) At the end of each month, each player who completed the
               non-empty set of monthly duties of at least one office
               during that month gains an Eb Note.

      (3) (D)  At the end of each week, each player who published at
               least one on-time judgement during that week gains a D
               Note.

      (4) (C)  At the end of each week, each player who gained at
               least one Point during that week gains a C Note.

          (C#) At the end of each week, each contestmaster who awarded
               at least one Point during that week gains a C# Note.

      (5) (B)  At the end of each week, each player who authored at
               least one proposal with an Interest Index of 2 that
               passed during that week gains a B note.

          (Bb) At the end of each week, each player who authored at
               least one proposal with an Interest Index of 3 that
               passed during that week gains a Bb note.

      Notes CAN be spent (destroyed) as follows:

      (1) A player CAN spend three Notes forming a major chord to
          increase another player's VVLOD by 1.

      (2) A player CAN spend five Notes forming the start of a major
          scale to increase eir own VVLOD by 1.

      (3) A player CAN spend three Notes forming a minor chord to
          decrease another player's VVLOD by 1.

      (4) A player CAN spend two Notes of the same pitch to make
          another player gain one Note of that pitch.

      (5) During Agora's Birthday, a player CAN spend Notes forming
          the melody "Happy Birthday" (GGAGCB GGAGDC GGGECBA FFECDC or
          a translation thereof) to satisfy the Winning Condition of
          Musicianship, unless another player has already done so
          during that Birthday.

      (6) A player CAN spend one Note to increase another player's
          voting limit on an ordinary proposal whose voting period is
          in progress by 1.

      (7) A player CAN spend two Notes to increase eir voting limit on
          an ordinary proposal whose voting period is in progress by
          1.

      (8) A player CAN spend three Notes to gain a Note whose pitch is
          as many semitones distant from one of the Notes spent as the
          distance between the other two Notes spent.

[CFJs 1826-1827 (called 6 December 2007): A decrease of VVLOD [VVLOP
at the time of these CFJs] cannot be by a negative number.]

      members of the larger set take part in the assignment.

      The following Prerogatives are defined:

      a) Default Officeholder.  The Default Officeholder CAN become
         holder of a vacant elected office by announcement, unless e
         is prevented from holding that office on an ongoing basis.

      b) Default Justice.  Whenever the Clerk of the Courts assigns a

         as a member, unless no such panel is eligible to be so
         assigned.

      c) Wielder of Veto.  The Wielder of Veto CAN veto an ordinary
         decision in its voting period by announcement; this increases
         its Adoption Index by 1.

      d) Wielder of Rubberstamp.  The Wielder of Rubberstamp CAN

         announcement; this decreases its quorum to 3, rules to the
         contrary notwithstanding.

Adjudication
      A category concerning the judicial system by which matters of

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 991/11 (Power=2)
Judicial Cases Generally

      A judicial case, also known as a call for judgement (CFJ), is a
      procedure to settle a matter of controversy.

      Each judicial case has exactly one subclass, with particular
      features as defined by other rules.  Subclasses of judicial case
      exist only as defined by the rules.  Defining a subclass of
      judicial case is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  A
      judicial case's subclass CAN be specified by its initiator, or
      otherwise defaults to inquiry.

      The Clerk of the Courts (CotC) is an office, responsible for
      managing judicial activity.  The CotC's report includes the
      status of all judicial cases that either require a judge or have
      at least one applicable judicial question that has no judgement.

      Judicial cases (other than appeal cases, which have historically
      been identified by reference to the prior case) have ID numbers,
      to be assigned by the Clerk of the Courts.

[CFJs 1692-1693 (called 20 June 2007): A CFJ can be unambiguously
referenced by using the customarily-assigned sequence numbers, even if
the number was not assigned in the public forum, provided that those
involved accept it as unambiguous at the time.]

[CFJ 1355 (called 28 April 2002): Titles for CFJs are unregulated, so
it is possible for a title to be assigned to a CFJ informally.]

[Cross-references (28 May 2008): the Clerk of the Courts' duties
are:
  * issue Writ of FAGE (rule 1789)
  * not assign judges during holiday (rule 1769)
  * prefer judicial panels containing the Default Justice (rule 2019)
  * report open judicial cases (rule 991)

Rule 2175/2 (Power=1)
Judicial Retraction and Excess

      If a judicial case has not had any judge assigned to it, then:

      a) Its initiator CAN retract it by announcement, thus causing it
         to cease to be a judicial case.

      b) If its initiator previously initiated five or more cases
         during the same Agoran week as that case, then it is an
         excess case, and the Clerk of the Courts CAN refuse it by
         announcement, thus causing it to cease to be a judicial case.

Rule 1868/12 (Power=2)
Judge Assignment Generally

      At any time, a judicial case either has no judge assigned to it
      (default) or has exactly one entity assigned to it as judge.
      This is a persistent status that changes only according to the
      rules.

      At any time, a judicial case either does not require a judge
      (default) or requires a judge.  This is not a persistent status,
      but is evaluated instantaneously.

      When a judicial case requires a judge and has no judge assigned,
      the CotC CAN assign a qualified entity to be its judge by
      announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as possible.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of a judicial
      case are the active first-class players, subject to modification
      by other rules.  Being unqualified to be assigned as a judge
      does not inherently prevent an entity from continuing to be
      judge of a case to which e is already assigned.

      When a player is poorly qualified to be assigned as judge of a
      judicial case, the Clerk of the Courts SHALL not assign em to be
      the judge of that case; if e has done so, and that player is
      still the judge of that case, then e CAN recuse that judge from
      that case by announcement.

      Making an entity unqualified or poorly qualified to judge is
      secured, with a power threshold of 1.5.

      To recuse a judge from a case is to deassign em as its judge.
      Assigning a judge to a case implicitly recuses its existing
      judge, if any.  A recusal is "with cause" if and only if stated
      as such by the rules.

[CFJ 1186: The Clerk of the Courts is required by Rule 1868 to select
a Judge who is qualified ["eligible" at the time of CFJ 1186] at the
time that the Judge is selected, regardless of whether that Player was
qualified at the time that the CFJ was actually called for or when the
identity of that Player is announced.]

Rule 1871/24 (Power=1.5)
The Standing Court

      Posture is a player switch, tracked by the Clerk of the Courts,
      with the following values:

      * Standing.  Standing players are generally qualified to judge.

      * Sitting.  Sitting players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        will generally become qualified when the CotC rotates the
        bench.

      * Leaning.  Leaning players are poorly qualified to judge, but
        are generally qualified to serve on appeal panels.

      * Supine (default).  Supine players are unqualified to judge.

      Changes to posture are secured.

      A player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value by
      announcement.

      When the CotC assigns a player as judge, that player becomes
      sitting.

      The CotC CAN rotate the bench (change all sitting players to
      standing) by announcement, but SHALL NOT do so unless there is a
      judicial case to which e is obliged to assign a judge, all
      entities qualified to be so assigned are poorly qualified, and e
      immediately afterwards (in the same announcement) assigns a
      judge to that case.

      When the CotC recuses a non-supine player with cause, e SHALL
      flip that player's posture to supine by announcement in a timely
      fashion.

[CFJ 1765 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, this rule makes em capable of doing
so.]

[CFJ 1766 (called 16 October 2007): When the CotC is obliged to change
a player's posture due to recusal, eir capability to do so exists as
long as the obligation does, and this obligation does not terminate
due to the time limit running out.]

        judge of any inquiry case.

      * Hugging.  Hugging players are unqualified to be assigned as
        judge of any criminal case, and poorly qualified to be
        assigned as judge of any equity case.

      * Hemming-and-Hawing (default).

      Changes to hawkishness are secured.

Rule 2157/5 (Power=1.7)
Judicial Panels

      A judicial panel is a structure whereby a group of two or more
      persons (its members) act together for the purpose of judging
      judicial cases.  A judicial panel's membership cannot change,
      and if two panels have the same membership then they are the
      same panel.  Judicial panels exist implicitly, without any
      specific act of formation.

      A judicial panel CAN send messages by means of any of its
      members sending a message identified as being from the panel,
      with the unanimous Support of the panel's other members, or
      (unless the CotC is a member of the panel, the prior judge, or
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the prior case) with the
      Support of at least half the other members and the Support of
      the CotC.  The CotC SHOULD so Support a majority action if the
      panel has made a reasonable effort to achieve consensus.  By
      this mechanism a judicial panel can act, in situations where the
      rules state that an action is performed by sending a message.

      A judicial panel can incur obligations.  The members of a panel
      SHALL act collectively to ensure that the panel satisfies all of
      its obligations.

[CFJ 1746 (called 21 September 2007): A judicial panel is not a
person.]

Rule 2158/5 (Power=2)
Judicial Questions

      A judicial question is a question that arises within a judicial
      case.  Judicial questions arise only as defined by the rules.
      Defining a judicial question is secured, with a power threshold
      of 1.7.

      At any time, each judicial question is either inapplicable
      (default) or applicable.  This is not a persistent status, but
      is evaluated instantaneously.

      At any time, each judicial question is either open (default),
      suspended, or has exactly one judgement.  This is a persistent
      status that changes only according to the rules.  The possible
      types of judgement for a judicial question depend on the type of
      question.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, its case
      requires a judge.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its case
      has a judge assigned to it, the judge CAN assign a valid
      judgement to it by announcement, and SHALL do so as soon as
      possible.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an inappropriate judgement
      to any judicial question.  A judgement is valid and/or
      appropriate only as defined by the rules.  Defining these things
      is secured, with a power threshold of 1.7.  If more than one
      judgement is valid and appropriate, then the choice between them
      is left to the judge's discretion.

      When a judicial question is applicable and open, and its judge
      has violated a time limit to assign a judgement to it, the Clerk
      of the Courts SHALL recuse that judge with cause by announcement
      as soon as possible; however, this requirement is waived if the
      judge assigns a judgement to it first.

[CFJ 1804 (called 19 November 2007): A judge should give the judgement
that e believes is appropriate, and if e does so in good faith then e
can be EXCUSED if the judgement is later found to have been
inappropriate.]

[CFJ 1871 (called 15 January 2008): The appropriateness of a judgement
is determined solely by the facts of the case, and is independent of
the reasoning used by a judge to decide on the judgement.]

      least four days, such a recusal is with cause.

      An entity (the transferee) CAN, with consent from the current
      judge of a judicial case (the transferor), assign emself as the
      new judge of that case, provided that e is qualified to be
      assigned as judge of that case, and e immediately (in the same
      announcement) assigns a judgement to a judicial question in that

Rule 591/26 (Power=1.7)
Inquiry Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an inquiry case.
      An inquiry case's purpose is to determine the veracity of a
      particular statement.  An inquiry case CAN be initiated by any
      first-class person, by announcement which includes the statement
      to be inquired into.  (Including a yes/no question is equivalent
      to including a statement that the answer to that question is
      yes, and for such a case, YES and NO are synonymous with the
      judgements TRUE and FALSE respectively.)

      The initiator is unqualified to be assigned as judge of the
      case, and in the initiating announcement e CAN disqualify one
      person from assignment as judge of the case.

      An inquiry case has a judicial question on veracity, which is
      always applicable.  The valid judgements for this question are:

      * FALSE, appropriate if the statement was factually and
        logically false at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * TRUE, appropriate if the statement was factually and logically
        true at the time the inquiry case was initiated

      * UNDECIDABLE, appropriate if the statement was logically
        undecidable or otherwise not capable of being accurately
        described as either false or true, at the time the inquiry
        case was initiated

      * IRRELEVANT, appropriate if the veracity of the statement at
        the time the inquiry case was initiated is not relevant to the
        game

      * UNDETERMINED, appropriate if the statement is nonsensical or
        too vague, or if the information available to the judge is
        insufficient to determine which of the FALSE, TRUE, and
        UNDECIDABLE judgements is appropriate; however, uncertainty as
        to how to interpret or apply the rules cannot constitute
        insufficiency of information for this purpose

      The judgement of the question in an inquiry case, and the
      reasoning by which it was reached, SHOULD guide future play
      (including future judgements), but do not directly affect the
      veracity of the statement.  The Rulekeepor is ENCOURAGED to
      annotate rules to draw attention to relevant inquiry case
      judgements.

[CFJ 1835 (called 18 December 2007): A question cannot generally take
the place of a statement in initiating an inquiry case.]

[CFJ 1903 (called 6 February 2008): The question-statement equivalence
established by this rule applies only for the purposes of the subject
of an inquiry case, not for acting by announcement.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the initiation of a CFJ even if public
knowledge at the time of initiation was not sufficient to determine
it.]

[CFJ 1482 (called 10 February 2004): If the truth of a CFJ statement
logically depends on the truth of statements of a previously-called
CFJ which has not yet been judged, the judge is entitled to treat this
as a situation of insufficient information being available.]

[CFJ 1744 (called 18 September 2007): It is not the job of the judge
to hunt down or request the information that would be required to
render a substantive judgement.]

[CFJ 1771 (called 28 October 2007): If an inquiry case revolves around
the interpretation of a specific message, and the initiator does not
provide a reasonable reference to that message , the judge is entitled
to treat this as a situation of insufficient information being
available.]

[CFJ 1732 (called 23 August 2007): If a particular player holds a
particular office, and an inquiry case on a statement that that player
holds that office is judged FALSE, that player still holds that
office.]

Rule 1504/23 (Power=1.7)
Criminal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as a criminal case.
      A criminal case's purpose is to determine the culpability of a
      particular person, known as the defendant, for an alleged breach
      of the rules, and to punish the guilty.  A criminal case CAN be
      initiated by any first-class person who is a member of the basis
      of any player, by announcement which clearly specifies all of
      the following:

      a) The identity of the defendant.

      b) Exactly one rule allegedly breached by the defendant.

      c) The action (which may be a failure to perform another action)
         by which the defendant allegedly breached this rule.

      The initiation of a criminal case begins its pre-trial phase.
      In the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL as soon as possible inform
      the defendant of the case and invite em to rebut the argument
      for eir guilt.  The pre-trial phase ends one week after the
      defendant has been so informed.  At any time during the
      pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN end the pre-trial phase by
      announcement.

      The initiator and each member of the defendant's basis are
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the case.  During the
      pre-trial phase, the defendant CAN disqualify one person from
      assignment as judge of the case, by announcement.  If e
      disqualifies the judge, then the judge is recused.

      A criminal case has a judicial question on culpability, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are:

      * OVERLOOKED, appropriate if the alleged act allegedly occurred
        at least 200 days before the case was initiated

      * ALREADY TRIED, appropriate if judgement has already been
        reached in another criminal case with the same defendant, the
        same rule, and substantially the same alleged act

      * UNIMPUGNED, appropriate if the alleged act was not proscribed
        by the specified rule at the time it allegedly occurred

      * INNOCENT, appropriate if the defendant did not perform the
        alleged act

      * SLIPPERY, appropriate if the information available to the
        judge is insufficient to determine beyond a reasonable doubt
        whether or not the defendant performed the alleged act

      * UNAWARE, appropriate if the defendant reasonably believed that
        the alleged act did not violate the specified rule

      * EXCUSED, appropriate if the defendant could not reasonably
        avoid breaching the rules in a manner at least as serious as
        that alleged

      * GUILTY, appropriate if the defendant breached the specified
        rule via the specified act and none of the above judgements is
        appropriate

      A criminal case has a judicial question on sentencing, which is
      applicable if the question on culpability is applicable and has
      a judgement of GUILTY.  If a criminal case has an applicable
      question on sentencing which has a judgement, the defendant is
      hereafter known as the ninny, the judgement in the question on
      sentencing is known as the sentence, and the sentence is in
      effect.

      Some types of sentence include a duration known as the tariff.
      When a sentence with a tariff is in effect, the sentence is
      active while all of the following are true, inactive otherwise:

      1) It is still in effect.

      2) At least one week has elapsed since it first took effect.

      3) Sentences of the same type on the same question on sentencing
         have been active for a total duration less than the tariff.
         (That is, if an active sentence is suspended and later
         reinstated or superseded by a similar sentence, then the
         defendant gets credit for time served prior to the
         suspension.)

      The CotC's report includes the status of all active sentences.

      The valid sentences are:

      * DISCHARGE, appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances, if
        any available non-null punishment would be manifestly unjust.
        Has no effect.

      * APOLOGY with a set of up to ten words (the prescribed words),
        appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.  When in
        effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours publish a formal
        apology of at least 200 words, including all the prescribed
        words, explaining eir error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire
        for self-improvement.  The ninny is only obliged to publish
        one apology per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
        this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
        than once.

      * FINE, appropriate for rule breaches of small consequence.
        When in effect, the ninny SHALL within 72 hours destroy one of
        eir Notes.  The ninny is only obliged to perform one
        destruction per question on sentencing, even if sentences of
        this type are assigned more than once or go into effect more
        than once.

      * CHOKEY with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied
        by the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for rule breaches of
        intermediate severity.  While a sentence of this type is
        active, the ninny is in the chokey.  No entity is in the
        chokey except as required by this rule.

      * EXILE with a duration (the tariff) up to 60 days multiplied by
        the power of the highest-power rule allegedly broken,
        appropriate if the severity of the rule breach is reasonably
        correlated with the length of the tariff, the middle of the
        tariff range being appropriate for severe rule breaches
        amounting to a breach of trust.  While a sentence of this type
        is active, the ninny is exiled.  No entity is exiled except as
        required by this rule.  If an exiled entity is ever a player,
        e is deregistered.  An exiled entity CANNOT register.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a criminal
      case within the past week CAN be initiated by the defendant by
      announcement.

[CFJ 1720 (called 12 August 2007): Where a criminal charge is
expressed in the form "violating rule NNNN by XXX", the alleged act
for the purposes of the rules is only "XXX".]

[CFJ 1845 (called 20 December 2007): Mentioning a rule in a section
labelled "arguments" in a message that attempts to initiate a criminal
case does not constitute clearly specifying the rule allegedly
breached.]

[CFJs 1857-1858 (called 31 December 2007): Ignorance of the law is not
appropriate grounds for a verdict of UNAWARE.]

[CFJ 1804 (called 19 November 2007): A verdict of EXCUSED is
appropriate where a person mistakenly, in good faith, believes that
eir action is legal when it is not.]

[CFJs 1808-1809 (called 28 November 2007): Sentencing a ninny to
"APOLOGY" without explicitly giving a set of prescribed words
constitutes sentencing the ninny to APOLOGY with the empty set of
prescribed words.]

[CFJ 1846 (called 20 December 2007): For the purposes of prescribed
words, words do not need to be a standard part of the language.]

Rule 2169/5 (Power=1.7)
Equity Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an equity case.
      An equity case's purpose is to correct a potential injustice in
      the operation of a particular contract.  An equity case CAN be
      initiated by any party to the contract, by announcement which
      clearly identifies the contract, the set of parties to the
      contract, and a state of affairs whereby events have not
      proceeded as envisioned by the contract (such as, but not
      limited to, a party acting in contravention of eir contractual
      obligations).

      The initiation of an equity case begins its pre-trial phase.  In
      the pre-trial phase the CotC SHALL in a timely fashion inform
      all the contracting parties of the case and invite them to
      submit arguments regarding the equitability of the situation.
      The pre-trial phase ends one week after the parties have been so
      informed, or immediately when all parties have announced that
      they wish to terminate the pre-trial phase.

      The members of the bases of the parties to the contract are all
      unqualified to be assigned as judge of the case.

      An equity case has a judicial question on equation, which is
      applicable at all times following the pre-trial phase.  The
      valid judgements for this question are the possible agreements
      that the parties could make that would be governed by the rules.
      A judgement is appropriate if and only if it is a reasonably
      equitable resolution of the situation at hand with respect to
      the matters raised in the initiation of the case and by the
      parties in the course of the case.

      When an applicable question on equation in an equity case has a
      judgement, and has had that judgement continuously for the past
      week (or all parties to the contract have approved that
      judgement), the judgement is in effect as a binding agreement
      between the parties.  In this role it is subject to modification
      or termination by the usual processes governing binding
      agreements.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in an equity
      case within the past week CAN be initiated by any party to the
      contract in question by announcement.

[CFJ 1772 (called 28 October 2007): An equity case cannot be initiated
with the rules as the subject contract.]

Rule 911/20 (Power=1.7)
Appeal Cases

      There is a subclass of judicial case known as an appeal case.
      An appeal case's purpose is to determine the appropriateness of
      a judgement that has been assigned to a judicial question, and
      make remedy if the judgement was poorly chosen.  The assignment
      of judgement being questioned (appealed against, or appealed) is
      referred to as the prior assignment; the word "prior" in this
      rule is used to refer to the circumstances of the prior
      assignment.

      An appeal concerning any assignment of judgement in a non-appeal
      case within the past two weeks CAN be initiated by any player
      with 2 support.  However, rules to the contrary notwithstanding,
      an appeal CANNOT be initiated concerning an assignment caused by
      a judgement in an appeal case, nor an assignment for which an
      appeal has already been initiated.

      The entities qualified to be assigned as judge of an appeal case
      are the judicial panels consisting of three members, where each
      of the members is qualified to be assigned as judge of the prior
      case and none of the members is the prior judge.

      An appeal case has a judicial question on disposition, which is
      applicable if and only if the prior question is applicable.  The
      valid judgements for the question on disposition, and their
      effects, are as follows:

      * AFFIRM, appropriate if the prior judgement was appropriate for
        the prior question; the prior judgement is assigned to the
        prior question again

      * REMAND, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement but the judge believes
        that the judge of the prior case can make a better judgement
        if given a new opportunity; the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * REASSIGN, appropriate if there is serious doubt about the
        appropriateness of the prior judgement; the judge of the prior
        case (if any) is recused, and the prior question is rendered
        open again

      * OVERRULE with a valid replacement judgement for the prior
        question, appropriate if the prior judgement was inappropriate
        in the prior question and the replacement judgement is
        appropriate for the prior question; the replacement judgement
        is assigned to the prior question

      When an appeal case is initiated, the prior question is
      suspended, and remains so until the question on disposition in
      the appeal case is judged.

      A panel CAN publish a concurring opinion when judging AFFIRM,
      and SHALL do so if and only if the reasoning by which the prior
      judge reached eir judgement was incorrect in whole or part.
      Each concurring opinion SHALL explain the nature of the error(s)
      in the prior judge's reasoning.  Each concurring opinion has an
      error rating, an integer from 1 to 99; it CAN be specified by
      the panel when the concurring opinion is published, or else
      defaults to 50.

      In the week after the panel publishes a valid judgement, any
      panel member may publish a formal Dissenting Opinion with
      Support.  This Dissenting Opinion becomes a part of the record
      of the case, and SHOULD aid in interpreting the decision.

[CFJ 1597 (called 22 December 2006): It is possible to appeal a
judgement even if it is not certain that the judgement exists.]

[CFJ 1800 (called 18 November 2007): An announcement of the form "I
call for the appeal of <judgement>" has the effect of initiating the
Agoran decision on whether to approve appealing the cited judgement.]

======================================================================
Patent Titles and Degrees
      A category concerning titles of honor and dishonor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 649/27 (Power=1.5)
Patent Titles

      A Patent Title is a legal item given in recognition of a
      person's distinction.  The herald is a low-priority office; its
      holder is responsible for tracking patent titles.

      A Patent Title CAN only be awarded by a proposal, or by the
      announcement of a person specifically authorized by the Rules to
      make that award.  A person so authorized SHALL make the award as
      soon as possible as the conditions authorizing em to make the
      award are posted publicly, unless there is an open judicial
      question contesting the validity of the conditions.  Awarding or
      revoking a Patent Title by Proposal is a secured change.

      When a Patent Title is awarded to a person, that person is said
      to Bear that Patent Title.  When a Patent Title is revoked from
      an entity, that entity ceases to Bear that Patent Title.  The
      status of Bearing a Patent Title can only be changed as
      explicitly set out in the Rules.  The Herald's report includes a
      list of each Patent Title that at least one entity Bears, with a
      list of which entities Bear it.

      As soon as possible after a patent title is awarded or revoked,
      the herald SHALL announce the award or revocation.

      When a patent title is used as a noun to refer to bearers of the
      patent title, it is assumed to refer only to persons who Bear
      that patent title unless context clearly indicates otherwise.

[CFJ 1525 (called 15 November 2004): If a patent title is defined by
the rules, and previously the rules defined a patent title with the
same spelling but a different award condition, the two are the same
patent title.]

[CFJ 1592 (called 1 December 2006): A patent title, once borne, is
borne until explicitly revoked, even if the rule defining the patent
title is repealed or the patent title was never defined by a rule.]

[CFJ 1731 (called 23 August 2007): It is possible for an entity [a
person at the time of CFJ 1731] to bear more than one instance of a
patent title simultaneously.]

[CFJ 1591 (called 1 December 2006): Where a person bears the patent
title X, and X is not also defined by the rules to have some special
meaning, it is correct to say that that person "is an X".]

[Cross-references (9 February 2008): the Herald's duties are:
  * report Patent Titles (rule 649)
  * announce award or revocation of Patent Title (rule 649)
  * award patent title of Champion (rule 1922)
  * report the manner of wins (rule 1922)
  * report title dates for Ministers Without Portfolio (rule 402)]

Rule 1922/24 (Power=1)
Defined Regular Patent Titles

      The following are Patent Titles:

      (a)  Scamster, which may be awarded to any Player who has shown
           great enthusiasm, persistence, or skill in the perpetrating
           of scams.  This title may not be declined, retracted, or
           revoked.

      (b)  A Patent Title (non-unique) now will
           Be known as "Bard", and granted those with wit.
           In order for the Title to be filled,
           A level of Support must call for it.

           Three players to a fourth may grant this name
           If these three write as one, with two Support.
           A current Bard may also grant the same,
           Provided that a second Bard's a sport.

           And so we don't the name of Bard debase,
           A Player with three Supporters can conspire
           To (from a Bard), this Title to erase:
           Or Bard (plus two Bards) make a Bard retire.

           But lest we ruin some poor minstrel's fun
           No bard will be dis-bard for eir bad pun.

      (c)  Three Months Long Service, Six Months Long Service, Nine
           Months Long Service, Twelve Months Long Service, to be
           awarded by the IADoP to any player who has held a
           particular Office continuously for the specified duration.
           Each of these titles shall be awarded only once per player.

      (d)  Champion, to be awarded by the Herald to any person who
           wins the game.  The Herald's report includes how the player
           won.

      (e)  Minister Without Portfolio, to be awarded by the Herald to
           any player who wins the game and does not already bear the
           title.  If the number of players bearing this title is
           greater than the number of Prerogatives defined by the
           rules, then this title is administratively revoked from the
           Speaker.

      (f)  Left in a Huff, to be awarded by the Clerk of the Courts or
           the Registrar (whichever one gets around to it first) to
           any player who publishes a Cantus Cygneus.

      (g)  Elder Lurker, to be awarded to Persons who are true legends
           that were involved in Agora in its early days and now
           continue to grace us with their presence by lurking on the
           lists to occasionally add tid-bits of wisdom or insight to
           discussions.

[CFJ 1865 (called 14 January 2008): The Patent Title of Champion
CANNOT be awarded by announcement of the Herald to a person who has
not won the game.]

Rule 1367/11 (Power=1.5)
Degrees

      Certain patent titles are known as degrees.  The degrees are

      - Associate of Nomic                 (A.N.)
      - Bachelor of Nomic                  (B.N.)
      - Master of Nomic                    (M.N.)
      - Doctor of Nomic History            (D.N.Hist.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Science            (D.N.Sci.)
      - Doctor of Nomic Philosophy         (D.N.Phil.)

      Degrees are ranked in the order they appear in this rule, with
      degrees listed later being ranked higher.

      A degree CANNOT be awarded to any person more than once, and
      CANNOT be revoked once awarded.

      A degree SHOULD be awarded ONLY IF its new bearer has published
      a suitable thesis with explicit intent to qualify for a degree
      (though not necessarily for the specific degree being awarded).
      A thesis is an essay whose topic is any facet of Agora Nomic or
      of nomic in general.  A thesis's suitability depends on its
      originality and quality, with regard to the rank of the degree
      to be awarded.

Contract Law
      A category concerning binding agreements that can be adjudicated
      within this nomic.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1742/14 (Power=1.5)
Contracts

      Contracts are binding agreements governed by the rules.  Any
      agreement made by one or more persons with the intention that it
      be binding on them and governed by the rules is a contract
      (unless it would automatically terminate as a contract).

      A contract automatically terminates if the number of parties to
      it falls below the number of parties the rules require for the
      contract.  If other rules do not specify such a number for a
      contract, then a contract requires at least two parties.

      Parties to a contract SHALL act in accordance with that
      contract.  This obligation is not impaired by contradiction
      between the contract and any other contract, or between the
      contract and the rules.

Rule 2197/1 (Power=1.5)
Defining Contract Changes

      A Contract Change can be one or more of any of the following:

      (a) a person who intends to be bound by a contract becoming a
          party to the contract;

      (b) a person ceasing to be a party to the contract;

      (c) amending a contract; and

      (d) terminating a contract

      If a Contract Change is ambiguous or its permissibility cannot

Rule 2198/1 (Power=1.5)
Making Contract Changes

      If a contract specifies a mechanism by which Contract Changes to
      it can be performed, then such changes CAN be performed using
      that mechanism.

      If a contract does not purport to regulate becoming a party to
      it, than any person CAN become a party to it by announcement.

      If the minimum number of parties for a contract is at least two,
      then Contract Changes CAN be made to it by agreement between all
      the parties to the contract.  Otherwise, any party to the
      contract CAN make Contract Changes to that contract without
      Objection if, before the dependent action is resolved, no party
      blocks the change by announcement.

[CFJ 1876 (called 18 January 2008): "Agreement between all parties"
can only exist if there are at least two parties.]

[CFJ 1770 (called 23 October 2007): Agreement between all the parties,

Rule 2178/2 (Power=1.5)
Public Contracts

      A public contract is a contract that has been identified as
      such, as specified by this rule.  Any other contract is private.

      A member of a contract CAN identify it as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership, provided that at least one
      of the following is true:

        (a) The contract contains a clause identifying it as public.

        (b) The publication is accompanied by a notice, indicating
            unanimous consent of members, that the contract be public.

        (c) The publication is accompanied by a notice, published
            without objection of its members, that the contract be
            public.

      A partnership CAN identify its contract as a public contract by
      publishing its text and membership.

      If the text of a potential contract is published with a clear
      indication that the contract will be public when it forms, then
      it is identified as a public contract when it becomes a
      contract.

      Changes in the text or membership of a public contract do not
      become effective until they are published.

Rule 2173/1 (Power=1)
The Notary

      The Notary is a low-priority office; its holder is responsible
      for keeping track of contracts.

      The parties to a public contract SHALL keep the Notary informed
      of its text and set of parties.  The Notary's report includes
      this information for each public contract.

      The parties to a private contract SHOULD keep the Notary
      informed of its text and set of parties.  The Notary SHALL
      disclose this information (to the extent that e has been
      informed of it) to the judge of an equity case pertaining to
      that contract.  The Notary SHALL NOT disclose it otherwise,
      except as explicitly allowed by the contract, or with the
      explicit consent of all parties.

      The Notary CAN terminate any contract without objection.

Rule 2145/4 (Power=2)
Partnerships

      A binding agreement governed by the rules which devolves its
      legal obligations onto a subset of its parties, numbering at
      least two, collectively, is a partnership.  The members of a
      partnership are those parties onto whom the partnership's legal
      obligations are collectively devolved.  A partnership's identity
      and partnershiphood are not disrupted by changes to its
      membership provided that it continues to meet the definition of
      a partnership.

      A partnership's basis is the set consisting of the union of the
      the bases of each of its members.  Where circularity occurs in
      this definition, it is resolved by using the minimum basis sets
      that provide consistency.

      A partnership that is a public contract and whose basis contains
      at least two persons is a person.

[CFJ 1701 (called 11 July 2007): To qualify as a member of a
partnership it is not necessary to be responsible for all of the
partnership's obligations.]

[CFJ 1855 (called 29 December 2007): A person who is not a party to a
partnership contract cannot have obligations placed on em by that
contract, and so cannot be a member of the partnership.]

Rule 2136/20 (Power=1)
Contests

      Contestmaster is a public contract switch, tracked by the
      Notary, with a default value of 'none', and a set of possible
      values which consists of all first-class players and 'none'.

      A public contract is a contest if and only if it has a
      contestmaster other than 'none'. The Scorekeepor's report
      contains the contestmaster of each contest.

      Any player CAN flip the contestmaster of a public contract
      without 3 objections, except if doing so would cause a player to
      be contestmaster of more than one contest, or it would flip the
      contestmaster of a contract to a player who has not explicitly
      consented to be contestmaster of that contest.  (If a player
      intends to flip the contestmaster of a contract to emself, this
      is considered explicit consent to be contestmaster of that
      contract.)

      Notwithstanding the rest of this rule, it is IMPOSSIBLE to flip
      the contestmaster of a contract to a player who is not party to
      that contract; and if a contract's contestmaster ceases to be
      party to that contract, that contract's contestmaster is flipped
      to 'none'.

      The total number of points a Contest MAY award in a given week
      is equal to 5 times the number of its members that are first-
      class players.  Points up to this total CAN be awarded by the
      contestmaster to other members by public announcement, and MUST
      be awarded as explicitly described in the contract.

      The total number of points a Contest MAY revoke in a given week
      is equal to 2 times the number of its members that are first-
      class players.  Points up to this total CAN be revoked by the
      contestmaster from other members by public announcement, and
      MUST be revoked as explicitly described in the contract.

      For each contest, ASAP after the beginning of each month, the
      Scorekeepor CAN and SHALL by announcement award a number of
      points, equal to the number of Players who were Contestants in
      that Contest at any time during the previous month, to the
      Player (if any) who was its Contestmaster for 16 or more days
      during the previous month, provided that the Contestmaster
      performed Contest-related duties in a timely manner during that
      time.

Frankenstein's Monster
      A category concerning a monstrous subgame ragarding the cobbling
      together of a rule from salvaged parts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2193/9 (Power=1)
The Monster

      Raaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

      A public Monster purporting to resolve an Agoran decision is
      self-ratifying.

      There is a format of the Monsterset known as the Short Logical
      Monsterset (SLM).  In this format, each Monster is assigned to a
      category, and the Monsters are grouped according to their
      category.

      Monsters are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Monsterkeepor sees fit.

      When the rules calls for an Agoran Monster to be made, the
      Monster-making process takes place in the following three
      stages, each described elsewhere:

      (a) Initiation of the Monster.
      (b) Voting of the people.
      (c) Resolution of the Monster.

      Upon the adoption of a proposal awarding a win to one or more
      Monsters, all those Monsters satisfy the Winning Condition of
      Legislation.

      The CotC's report includes the status of all Monster-related
      cases that either require a Monster or have at least one
      applicable Monster-related question that has no judgement.

      "First-class Monster" means a Monster of a biological nature.

      The Monster's adopted motto is "Le monstre n'est pas une
      fontaine."

      The initiation of a Monstrous decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target Monster and the
      changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the specification of
      a Monstrous decree causes it to be void and without effect.
      This is the only mechanism by which a Monstrous decree can be
      initiated.

      If an instance of a switch comes to have a Monster, it ceases to
      have any other Monster.

      SHALL act on behalf of the Monster to ensure that the Monster
      fulfills all of its duties.

      The Mad Scientist's weekly duties include the performance of the
      following tasks, in order:

      a) Randomly select exactly one rule.  If the selected rule is
         either this rule or the rule "The Monster", then the
         villagers have shown up with torches and pitchforks; skip
         directly to proposal submission.

      b) Select one or more contiguous sentences from the selected
         rule.

      c) Select exactly one noun from the selected text, and replace
         each instance of that noun with "Monster" (including
         grammatical variations, e.g. replacing "<noun>'s" with
         "Monster's").

      d) Submit a proposal, with adoption index equal to the Power of
         the selected rule, and interest index 0, to append the
         modified text to the rule "The Monster" (or, if the villagers
         have shown up with torches and pitchforks, to repeal both
         that rule and this one).  This proposal counts as the Mad
         Scientist's weekly report if/when it is adopted.

[Cross-references (23 April 2008): the Mad Scientist's duties are:

Rule 2200/1 (Power=1)
Nomic Definitions

      A nomic ruleset is a set of explicit rules that provides means
      for itself to be altered arbitrarily, including changes to those
      rules that govern rule changes. Not all rule changes need be
      possible in one step; an arbitrarily complex combination of
      actions (possibly including intermediate rule changes) can be
      required, so long as any rule change is theoretically achievable
      in finite time.

      A nomic is the single entity defined by a nomic ruleset as a
      whole.  Each nomic ruleset defines exactly one nomic, and each
      nomic is defined by exactly one nomic ruleset.

      A foreign nomic is a nomic that is not Agora. Adopting the name
      of "Agora" does not disqualify a nomic from being foreign; any
      nomic that is not the One True Agora is a foreign nomic.

      A province is a protectorate that is a player.

Rule 2185/0 (Power=1)
Foreign Relations

      Recognition is a foreign nomic switch, tracked by the
      Ambassador, with values Unknown (default), Protected, Friendly,
      Neutral, Sanctioned, Hostile, and Abandoned.

      When a foreign nomic becomes a Protectorate, its Recognition
      becomes Protected.  When a foreign nomic ceases to be a
      Protectorate, its Recognition becomes Unknown.  A foreign
      nomic's Recognition CANNOT change to or from Protected in any
      other way.

      The Ambassador CAN, without objection, flip a foreign nomic's
      Recognition to any value (subject to the above restriction).  E
      SHALL inform that nomic of the change as soon as possible.

History:
Created by Proposal 5392 (Murphy), 16 January 2008

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2147/5 (Power=2)
Protectorates

      Whereas Agora, being the superpower of nomics, has an inherent
      responsibility to lead the nomic world; and whereas Agora
      desires to encourage growth and promotion of the nomic
      community, be it hereby known that Agora shall serve as
      benevolent protector to any nomic which requests such status
      (hereafter referred to as the protectorate).

      In order to become a protectorate, a nomic must specify in its
      ruleset that it submits to Agora as its benevolent protector.
      It must also have rules or other gamestate arranged such that
      any protective decree proclaimed by the ambassador will take
      full effect upon proclamation.  Any restriction whatsoever on
      the content of a protective decree disqualifies the nomic from
      being a protectorate.

      If the criteria specified in the preceding paragraph are met,
      the ambassador may make the nomic a protectorate with Agoran
      Consent.  If a protectorate ever does not meet these criteria,
      it ceases to be a protectorate.  The ambassador shall check
      every month whether each protectorate continues to meet the
      criteria, and shall announce whenever a protectorate has ceased
      to be a protectorate.

      The ambassador's report includes a list of all protectorates,
      with contact details for each, and for each the forum in which
      it is most appropriate to proclaim protective decrees that
      target that protectorate.

[Note (25 July 2007): Suggested wording for a protectorate's ruleset:
"Any protective decree of Agora that targets this nomic takes effect
as specified by the rules of Agora.".]

[CFJ 1707 (called 20 July 2007): If a nomic's ruleset contains a
statement similar to "This nomic allows Agora unrestricted access to
make changes to its ruleset.", this can be interpreted as "This
nomic's rules change whenever the rules of Agora say they do.", thus
satisfying the requirement to make protective decrees effective [at
the time of CFJ 1707, the vaguer requirement to allow Agora to change
its ruleset].]

Rule 2159/2 (Power=2)
Protective Decrees

      A protective decree is an act of Agora the intended effect of
      which is to make explicit changes to the state of a protectorate
      nomic.  The changes may include enacting, repealing, or amending
      rules of the protectorate, changing the set of players of the
      protectorate, or any other instantaneous changes to the
      protectorate's gamestate.

      The initiation of a protective decree is a secured change.  The
      initiating instrument must specify the target protectorate and
      the changes to be made to it.  Any ambiguity in the
      specification of a protective decree causes it to be void and
      without effect.  This is the only mechanism by which a
      protective decree can be initiated.

      As soon as possible after a protective decree has been
      initiated, the ambassador SHALL proclaim it to the target nomic.
      The decree takes effect upon this proclamation.

      Protective decrees should be initiated only for the purpose of
      assisting the protectorate in its growth and enabling its
      longevity.  Protective decrees should always be benevolent.

      All players are prohibited from falsely claiming, to any nomic,
      that a document is a protective decree.

[CFJ 1860 (called 8 January 2008): Falsely claiming, to an entity that
is neither a nomic nor a means of contacting a nomic, that a document
is a protective decree is not a violation of rule 2159.]

Rule 2206/0 (Power=1)
Foreign Trade

      A player CAN spend some of eir assets to export them to a
      foreign nomic; e SHALL inform that nomic of the export as soon
      as possible, preferably by simultaneously sending the
      announcement to an appropriate foreign forum.

      The Ambassador SHOULD encourage foreign nomics to adopt
      legislation recognizing Agoran exports by creating comparable
      foreign assets.

      Players are encouraged to adopt legislation recognizing foreign
      exports by creating comparable Agoran assets.

Rule 1727/17 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic, known
      unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played on,
      until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

      BE IT FURTHERMORE RESOLVED that Agora's Unbirthday is defined to
      be the entire day of December 30, GMT +1200, of each year; but,
      since that falls within a Holiday, is observed during the entire
      days of January 12 through 14, GMT +1200, of each year.

      A first-class player who is a member of an existing public
      contract CAN make the contract into a Contest, with emself as
      the sole contestmaster, without 3 objections, provided e is not
      the contestmaster of another contest.  Another first-class
      player who is a member may replace the current contestmaster as
      the sole contestmaster without 3 objections, but only as
      explicitly described in the contest regulations and provided e
      is not the contestmaster of another contest.

      A contest requires at least one party.  Any player may make a
      contest cease to be a contest without 3 objections.  Players
      SHOULD decide on whether a contract deserves to be a contest
      based on its fairness or interest to players as a whole.

      said to be in that location.  A person who ceases to be a party
      to a location is said to leave that location.

      A person cannot be in more than a single location at one time.
      A person who moves to a location automatically leaves any
      location e is already in.  Whenever a person's location does not
      permit em to leave it, e CANNOT move to any other location.

      A location requires at least zero parties.

[CFJ 1877 (called 18 January 2008): It is not possible to cease to be
a party to a location which has exactly one party by announcement,
even if the text of the location explicitly permits this.]

Rules Viewed as Binding Agreement

      In general, the Rules shall be adjudicated as if the Rules were
      a binding agreement between all Players, entered into by every
      player as a part of becoming a Player.  An actual or alleged
      Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding
      agreement to be bound by the Rule or Rules in question.

      The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
      be bound by the rules.

[CFJ 1772 (called 28 October 2007): Despite this rule, the rules are
not a contract as defined by rule 1742, and cannot be adjudicated as a
binding agreement.]

      Posture is a player switch with values Standing, Sitting,
      Leaning, and Supine (default), tracked by the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A player CAN flip eir posture to any non-standing value
      by announcement.  Changes to posture are secured.

      A supine player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      judicial case.  A sitting or leaning player is poorly qualified
      to be assigned as judge of any judicial case.

      Hawkishness is a player switch with values Hanging, Hugging, and
      Hemming-and-Hawing (default), tracked by the Clerk of the
      Courts.  A player CAN flip eir hawkishness by announcement.

      A hanging player is unqualified to be assigned as judge of any
      inquiry case.  A hugging player is unqualified to be assigned as
      judge of any criminal case, and poorly qualified to be assigned
      as judge of any equity case.

      When the CotC assigns a standing player as judge of a judicial
      case, the player becomes sitting, except in the situation
      discussed in the next sentence.  If the CotC assigns a standing
      player as judge of more than one judicial case consecutively in
      the same announcement, and states in the announcement that these
      are linked assignments, the player becomes sitting upon the last
      of these assignments, but not any of the earlier ones.  The CotC
      SHOULD NOT perform linked assignments unless the cases being
      linked are closely related in their subject matter.

      When a public document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so
      that the ratified document was completely true and accurate at
      the time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      public document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel
      any messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or
      overlooked, or change the legality of any attempted action.

a2245 7
[CFJ 1836 (called 18 December 2007): Ratification of an official
document affects only those aspects of gamestate that are defined to
be part of the official report, and not aspects that are incidentally
reported on; in particular, ratification of an official report on
certain parameters pertaining to each player does not ratify the list
of players.]

      If intent to achieve consent for a nominee is announced as

      position with eir own consent by announcement, during the
      minimum waiting period between intent and action defined for

      An announcement of intent to perform a dependent action,
      unambiguously describing the action and method of dependent
      action, initiates the Agoran decision of whether to approve the
      action.  For this decision:

      (a) The vote collector is the announcer.

      (b) The available options are SUPPORT and OBJECT.

      (c) The voting period ends after fourteen days or immediately
          before it is resolved, whichever comes first.

      (d) The eligible voters are those entities that were active
          first-class players at the start of the voting period,
          except for any entities disqualified by the rule specifying
          that the action can be performed dependently.

      (e) The voting limit of each eligible voter is one.

      (f) The vote collector of such a decision CANNOT resolve it if
          it was initiated more than fourteen days ago, or (if it has
          an objection and/or majority index) less than four days ago.

      (g) If the outcome is APPROVED, then the vote collector performs
          the action upon resolving the decision.

      (h) The announcer, by virtue of the announcement of intent,
          implicitly submits a ballot of SUPPORT on the Agoran
          decision, if e is an eligible voter and does not explicitly
          repudiate this implication in the announcement.

      (b) Without N Objections.  For this method, the objection index

              REJECTED.

          (2) If the strength of SUPPORT is less than the support
              index (if any), then the outcome is REJECTED.

              strength of SUPPORT and OBJECT is less than or equal to
              the majority index (if any), then the outcome is

      The Conductor is an office, and the recordkeepor of Notes.

      Notes are gained as follows:

      (1) At the end of each week, for each player, let X be the
          number of eir interested proposals that were adopted during

      Any person or group of persons may create an agreement with the
      intention that it be binding upon them and be governed by the
      rules.  Such an agreement is known as a contract.  A contract
      may be modified, including changing the set of parties, by
      agreement between all parties.  A contract may also terminate by
      agreement between all parties.  A contract automatically
      terminates if the number of parties to it falls below the
      minimum number of parties defined by the rules for that
      contract.  If not otherwise specified, the minimum number of
      parties for any contract is two.

      Parties to a contract governed by the rules SHALL act in
      accordance with that contract.  This obligation is not impaired
      by contradiction between the contract and any other contract, or
      between the contract and the rules.

Voting Credits
d2834 12
a2845 4
      Voting Credits (VCs) are a class of fixed assets that can be
      used to affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  Changes to
      VC holdings are secured.  Ownership of VCs is restricted to
      players.
d2847 2
a2848 22
      Each VC has exactly one color.  Colors with different names are
      distinct, regardless of spectral proximity.  Each color of VC is
      a currency.  If a player is meant to lose a VC of a color that e
      does not possess, then e loses a VC of eir Party's color
      instead; if e has no VCs at all, then the loss is waived (you
      can't get blood from a turnip).

      The Accountor is the recordkeepor of VCs.

      VCs are gained and lost as follows:

      (+R) When an interested proposal is adopted, its proposer gains
           a number of Red VCs equal to the proposal's adoption index
           times its interest index (rounded down to the nearest
           integer), minus the number of Red VCs that e has gained in
           this way earlier in the same week (down to a minimum of
           zero), and each coauthor of the proposal gains one Red VC

Making Wagers

      A Wager is an announcement specifying the following:

      (a) A statement that is, or will become, true or false,

      (b) The number and color of Marks being wagered, which MUST be
          less than or equal to the number of Marks possessed by that
          player, and

      (c) The outcome wagered on by the offering player.

      Any other player with Marks greater than or equal to the amount
      of the Wager CAN accept it by announcement, unless the Wager has
      already been accepted.  E thereby wagers on the opposite outcome
      from that wagered on by the offering player.

Resolving Wagers

      A Wager MAY be resolved when the following conditions are met:

      (a) The Wager has been accepted, and

      (b) The statement that is the subject of the Wager is either
          true or false.

      An accepted Wager CAN be resolved by a correct announcement
      specifying the truth value of the statement, which must be
      exactly one of true or false.

      As soon as possible after a Wager is resolved the player who
      wagered on the incorrect outcome MUST transfer the agreed number
      and color of Marks to the player who wagered on the correct
      outcome.

Rule 2176/6 (Power=2)
Marks

      Marks are a class of assets.  Ownership of Marks is restricted
      to persons.

      Each Mark has exactly one color.  Each color of Mark is a
      currency.  If a player is meant to lose a Mark of a color that e
      does not possess, then e loses a Mark of eir Party's color
      instead; if e has no Marks at all, then e loses a VC of the same
      color as the Mark e is meant to lose, gains 100 Marks of that
      color, and then loses the Mark; however, if e has no VCs at all,
      either, then the Mark loss is waived (you still can't get blood
      from a turnip, not even a thimbleful at a time).

      The Accountor is the recordkeepor of Marks.

      Marks are gained and lost as follows:

      (+r) When the Agoran decision of whether to adopt a proposal is
           resolved, each player who voted on it gains one Red Mark.
           If at least one of eir votes is FOR or AGAINST, and the
           ratio of eir FOR to AGAINST votes does not equal the
           proposal's adoption index, then e gains another Red Mark.
           If the proposal is adopted, and e was the only player to
           vote AGAINST it, then e gains another ten Red Marks, and
           the author gains ten Red Marks.

      (-r) When a proposal's voting period is extended because it
           would fail quorum, each eligible voter who has not voted on
           it loses five Red Marks.  When a proposal meets quorum but
           is rejected, and only one player (other than possibly the
           author) voted FOR it, then that player loses ten Red Marks,
           and the author loses ten Red Marks.

      (+g) At the end of each month, for each office without a report,
           the player (if any) who held that office for the majority
           of that month gains one Green Mark, unless another person
           deputised for that office while that player held that
           office during that month, in which case the deputising
           player gains one Green Mark.

      (+b) When a person calls for judgement, e gains one Blue Mark,
           except as noted below.  When a judgement that caused the
           loss of a Blue Mark as noted below is overturned, the
           caller gains one Blue Mark.  When a judicial panel judges
           an appeal case, each member gains one Blue Mark.

      (-b) When a person calls for judgement, and has already done so
           at least five times in the same week, e loses two Blue
           Marks.  When an inquiry case is judged IRRELEVANT, or a
           criminal case is judged OVERLOOKED, ALREADY TRIED, or
           UNIMPUGNED, the caller loses one Blue Mark.  When a
           judicial panel is recused with cause, each member loses one
           Blue Mark.  When a concurring opinion is published, the
           prior judge loses a number of Blue Marks equal to its error
           rating.

      (+m) When, during the observance of Agora's unbirthday, a player
           publicly acknowledges the occasion, e gains 2N+1 magenta
           Marks (where N is Agora's age rounded down to the nearest
           integer), unless e previously gained Marks in this manner
           during the same unbirthday.

      Only valid, unretracted votes count toward the conditions for
      gaining and losing Red Marks.

      Marks may be spent as follows, by announcement (INVALID unless
      the color is specified):

      a) A player may spend 100 Marks of the same color to gain one VC
         of that color.

      Mark awards and penalties SHALL be announced, as soon as
      possible after they occur, by the officer required to announce
      VC awards of the same color.

[CFJ 1847 (called 20 December 2007): When a person calls for
judgement, and has already done so at least five times in the same
week, e is not awarded a blue mark by section (+b).]

      eir EVLOP is set to eir BVLOP.  At the end of each week, each
      player's EVLOP is set to eir VVLOP, rounded to an integer,

      Points are a class of fixed assets.  Ownership of points is
      restricted to players.

      Points are a currency.  The number of points owned by a player
      is eir score.

      A contest is an contract that

      (a) identifies itself as a contest,

      (b) identifies exactly one party as its contestmaster,

      (c) allows any First-class player to become a party,

      (d) is public, and is published before any contestants become a
          party to it, and

      (e) is a dependent contract.

      All parties to the contract who are not the contestmaster are
      its contestants.

      The Scorekeepor is an office, and the recordkeepor of points.

      For each contest which has been a contest for at least a week,
      and has as its contestmaster a first-class person who has been
      contestmaster of that contest for the entire past week and has
      not been the contestmaster of any other contest during the past
      week, the contestmaster CAN award a total of up to 10 points per
      week to one or more contestants as permitted by the contest.

      A player with 100 or more points may win the game by announcing
      this fact.  Upon such an announcement, each player's score is
      set to zero.

[CFJ 1777 (called 4 November 2007): A contest is a contract as
governed by rule 1742.]

[CFJ 1777 (called 4 November 2007): A purported contest that is
created and then dissolved so quickly that there is no practical
opportunity for unaware players to join it is thereby not allowing any
first-class player to become a party, and thereby not a contest.]

[CFJs 1792-1793 (called 13 November 2007): For a purported contest to
allow any first-class player to become a party, the players must have
at least 96 hours from first becoming aware of the agreement text to
review it in order to make an informed decision as to whether to
consent to it.]

[CFJ 1817 (called 2 December 2007): For a contract to be a dependent
contract, where the term "dependent contract" is not explicitly
defined by the rules, it is not sufficient for the contract to be a
"dependent contract" as defined by a particular player or by a
contract.]

[CFJ 1818 (called 2 December 2007): A non-first-class contestmaster
categorically cannot award points.]

      Except where modified by other rules, the entities qualified to
      be assigned as judge of a judicial case are the active

      judge does not inherently prevent an entity from continuing to

      Within a judicial case, one or more judicial questions may
      arise.  Each judicial question is either inapplicable (default)
      or applicable; this is not a persistent status but is evaluated
      instantaneously.  Each judicial question either is open
      (default), suspended, or has a particular judgement; this is a
      persistent status that changes only according to the rules.  The
      possible types of judgement for a judicial question vary
      according to the type of question.

      When a judicial case has an applicable open judicial question,
      it requires a judge, and its judge CAN assign a valid judgement
      to that question by announcement.  Whenever there is a judge
      assigned to a judicial case with an applicable open question,
      the judge SHALL assign such a judgement to the question as soon
      as possible.

      Whenever a judicial case has a judicial question that has
      remained applicable and open, while the same judge has been
      assigned to the case, continuously for the past week, the CotC
      CAN recuse that judge with cause by announcement.  Whenever a
      judicial case has a judicial question that has remained
      applicable and open, while the same judge has been assigned to
      the case, continuously for the past two weeks, the CotC SHALL so
      recuse the judge as soon as possible.

      Among the possible judgements of a judicial question, some
      subset of them are appropriate.  Judgements are appropriate only
      where so defined by the rules.  A judge SHALL NOT assign an
      inappropriate judgement.  Where more than one appropriate
      judgement is available, the choice between them is at the
      judge's discretion.

[CFJ 1773 (called 28 October 2007): An announcement that claims to

all the elements required for a criminal case, does not initiate a

Rule 2149/7 (Power=1)
Truthiness, or the Island of Knights and Knaves
d375 7
a381 18
      Truthiness is a player switch, tracked by the Registrar, with
      the following possible values:

      KNIGHT - the player is a knight (default)
      KNAVE  - the player is a knave
      SPY    - the player is neither a knight nor a knave
      FOOL   - the player is both a knight and a knave

      A knight SHALL NOT publish statements that e believes are false
      or which e is reckless regarding the veracity of.  A knave SHALL
      NOT publish statements that e believes are true or which e is
      reckless regarding the veracity of.

      Merely quoting a statement does not constitute publishing it for
      the purposes of this rule.  Any disclaimer, conditional clause,
      or other qualifier attached to a statement constitutes part of
      the statement for the purposes of this rule; the truth or
      falsity of the whole is what is significant.
a386 11
[CFJ 1768 (called 22 October 2007): Rule 2149's obligation on a
knights to not publish statements that e believes are false is not in
conflict with the knight's right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1738 (called 29 August 2007): Rule 2149's obligation on a knave
to not publish statements that e believes are true is in conflict with
the knave's right of participation in the fora.]

[CFJ 1730 (called 22 August 2007): Knave status does not change the
interpretation of statements made by a player.]

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument with power 2 or

      protective decree.  The initiating instrument must specify the
      target protectorate and the changes to be made to it.  Any
      ambiguity in the specification of a protective decree causes it
      to be void and without effect.  This is the only mechanism by
      which a protective decree can be initiated.

a1829 1
      For the purpose of this rule:
d1831 18
a1848 22
      a) A document is part (possibly all) of a public message.

      b) An official document is a document labeled as part (possibly
         all) of an official report.  The scope of an official
         document is the part of the official report that the official
         document is labeled as being.

      Any player CAN, without objection, ratify part or all of an
      official document.  The date of this ratification and the scope
      of the ratified document become part of the official report in
      question, until the same scope is ratified at a later date.

      Any document defined by the rules as self-ratifying is ratified
      one week after its publication, unless explicitly challenged
      during that period.

      When a document is ratified, the gamestate is modified so that
      the ratified document was completely true and accurate at the
      time it was published.  Nevertheless, the ratification of a
      document does not invalidate, reverse, alter, or cancel any
      messages or actions, even if they were unrecorded or overlooked,
      or change the legality of any attempted action.

      Any proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change
      the validity of one or more of a voter's ballots on an Agoran
      decision whose voting period has begun but which has not yet
      been resolved shall be wholly without effect, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, no ballots on that
      decision may be validly submitted or retracted, and the outcome
      of the decision may not be changed in any way, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  Nothing in this rule shall be
      construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting
      the resolution of an Agoran decision.

      The resolution of an Agoran decision is self-ratifying.

[CFJ 1748 (called 22 September 2007): The resolution of an Agoran
decision being self-ratifying does not mean that a purported
announcement of resolution is self-ratifying.]

      this nomic.  The speaker embodies the spirit of Agora.
      Diplomatic missions from this nomic to foreign nomics operate on
      behalf of the speaker.

  * rubberstamp an Ordinary Proposal (rule 2019)
  * titular head of state (rule 402)

      There should always be exactly one player who is the Speaker.
      No one other than a player can be Speaker, and there can never
      be more than one Speaker.  If there is ever no Speaker then
      the player whose most recent registration was earliest becomes
      the Speaker.

      A fixed asset is one defined as such by its backing document.
      Any other asset is liquid.  The owner of a liquid asset
      generally CAN transfer it to another entity by announcement.

      The recordkeepor of a class of assets is the entity defined as
      such by its backing document.  That entity's report includes a
      list of all instances of that class and their owners.  If this
      portion of that entity's report is not challenged within a week
      after its publication, then it becomes correct, even if it would
      otherwise be incorrect.

      If an asset's backing document restricts its ownership to a
      class of entities, then that asset CANNOT be gained by or
      transferred to an entity outside that class, and is destroyed if
      it is owned by an entity outside that class.

      Voting Credits (VCs) are items that can be possessed by players
      and used to affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  VCs
      CANNOT be affected except by the action of an instrument with
      power greater than or equal to the power of this rule.  VCs
      CANNOT be possessed by any entity other than a player: in any
      situation that would otherwise violate this condition, the
      offending VCs are lost or never gained.

      Each VC has a color.  If a player is meant to lose a VC of a
      color that e does not possess, then e loses a VC of eir Party's
      color instead; if e has no VCs at all, then the loss is waived
      (you can't get blood from a turnip).

         has gained in this way earlier in the same week (down to a
         minimum of zero), and each coauthor named in the proposal
         gains one Red VC unless e gained a VC in this way earlier in
         the same week.

      b) At the end of each month, for each office with a report, the
         player (if any) who held that office for the majority of that
         month gains two Green VCs (if the office has a weekly report)
         or one Green VC (if it has only a monthly report), unless

      c) A player who assigns a judgement to a judicial question

         VC.

      VCs may be lost as follows:

         index, its proposer loses one Red VC.

      b) At the end of each month, for each office, for each player
         who has held that office during that month, if another person
         deputised for that office while that player held that office
         during that month then that player loses one Green VC.

      c) A player who is recused from a judicial case with cause loses
         one Blue VC.  A player who is the prior judge in an appeal
         case where a judgement other than AFFIRM is assigned to the

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1681/11 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.

      Rules are assigned to, ordered within, or moved between
      categories, and categories are added, changed, or empty
      categories removed, as the Rulekeepor sees fit.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's ID
      number, revision number, power, title, and text.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, and
      any historical annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to
      record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeepor shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating the type
      of change, the date on which the change took effect, the
      mechanism which specified the change, and if the rule was
      changed due to a proposal, a reference to that proposal, its
      proposer, and any coauthors explicitly named in that proposal.

Rule 103/2 (Power=3)
Always a Speaker

      There should always be exactly one player who is the Speaker.
      No one other than a player can be Speaker, and there can never
      be more than one Speaker.  If there is ever no Speaker then
      the player whose most recent registration was earliest becomes
      the Speaker.

Rule 402/19 (Power=1)
Office of Speaker

      The speaker is an office.

      If an active player who is not the speaker has won the game
      within the past week, e may become the speaker, thus removing
      any previous speaker from the office, by announcement, unless
      someone else has become speaker within the preceding 90 days.
      If the legality of an attempted installation of this type is not
      challenged within a week, then it is effective even if later
      found to be illegal.

      A speaker who became speaker within the preceding 90 days cannot
      be replaced by Agoran Consent if e is one of those whose
      objections are counted in the Agoran Consent procedure.

[Cross-references (17 August 2007): the Speaker's duties are:
  * rubberstamp an Ordinary Proposal (rule 2019)
The other provisions governing the Speakership are:
  * filling Speakership if it becomes vacant (rule 103)
  * installation due to winning (rule 402)
  * can't be replaced without consent (rule 402)
  * initial Speaker (rule 104) (provision spent)]

      An action is dependent, or may be performed dependently, if and
      only if it is an Action Without N Objections or an Action With N
      Supporters, where N is a nonnegative integer.  The phrase
      "Without Objection" is synonymous with "Without 1 Objection",
      and the phrase "With Support" is synonymous with "With 1
      Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N first-class players have publicly posted
                objections (and not publicly retracted eir objections)
                to the performance of the action; and

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at

                made the announcement under (a) of this rule have

           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit

Replacing the Vote Collector

      If the rules indicate that an office is to be responsible for
      collecting votes on a particular Agoran decision, then the
      holder of that office is the default vote collector for that
      decision.

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is tardy if
      and only if the voting collector has continuously held that role
      for at least seven days following the end of the voting period
      and the decision has not yet been resolved.  If a vote collector
      is tardy, then the first player to announce that e takes up the
      role of vote collector becomes the vote collector for that
      decision.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule that would allow the
      vote collector for an Agoran decision to be changed.

History:
Created by Proposal 4811 (Maud, Goethe), 20 June 2005

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 208/3 (Power=3)
d1910 5
a1914 5
      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is
      authorized to resolve that decision, and does so by publishing a
      valid notice which states that the matter has been resolved,
      indicating the option selected by Agora.  To be valid, this
      notice must satisfy the following conditions:
d1926 1
a1926 4
      Each Agoran decision shall have at most one vote collector at a
      time.  The identity of the vote collector is set by the message
      initiating the decision, and can only be changed as specified by
      other rules with power at least as great as that of this rule.
d1937 1
d1941 1
a1941 1
Rule 955/10 (Power=3)
d1944 28
a1971 29
      To determine which option on a particular Agoran decision was
      selected by Agora, the vote collector shall perform the
      following steps in order after the voting period has ended.

      (a) E shall invalidate any ballots which the rules require em to
          invalidate, and no others.

      (b) E shall count the number of distinct voters who submitted
          ballots which remain valid.  If this number is less than the
          quorum and there is more than one available option, then the
          option selected by Agora is FAILED QUORUM.  Otherwise, the
          decision achieved quorum.

      (c) If the decision is whether to adopt a proposal, e shall
          determine the voting index as follows:

          (1) if the strength of FOR is positive and the strength of
              AGAINST is zero, then the voting index is Unanimity; but

          (2) if the strength of FOR is zero, then the voting index is
              zero; otherwise,

          (3) the voting index is the ratio of the strength of FOR to
              the strength of AGAINST.

          If the voting index exceeds one and meets or exceeds the
          adoption index of the decision, and if further quorum was
          achieved, then the option selected by Agora is ADOPTED.
          Otherwise, the option selected by Agora is REJECTED.

      Each entity at any time either is or is not a player.  The verb
      "to be registered" means to become a player, and the verb "to be
      deregistered" means to cease to be a player.  Where the verb "to
      register" or "to deregister" is used without an explicit direct
      object, the action is implicitly reflexive.  The adjective
      "registered", or its fuller form "registered as a player",
      describes those who are players.
d604 2
a605 9
      A person is permitted to register or deregister unless
      specifically prohibited. A person registers or deregisters by
      announcement.

      Whenever a player deregisters, e is prohibited from registering
      for the next thirty days.

      A player who is not a person and has never been a first-class
      person can be deregistered by any player by announcement.

      A player holding two or more positions within one of these sets

      This rule takes precedence over all rules governing offices.

[CFJ 1705 (called 18 July 2007): It is possible for a person to hold
two "mutually exclusive" positions simultaneously, albeit only for an
infinitesemal period, because rule 1450 does not prevent this
situation arising but removes the person from one of the positions
when the situation has occurred.]

Judgements Must Accord with the Rules

      All Judgements must be in accordance with the Rules; however, if
      the Rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the Statement
      to be Judged, then the Judge shall consider game custom, common
      sense, past Judgements, and the best interests of the game
      before applying other standards.

      When a Judge is considering eir Judgement of a Statement
      contained in a CFJ, e shall make eir evaluation based on the
      truth or falsity of the Statement at the time the CFJ was
      issued.

[CFJ 897: The requirements in Rule 217 on Judgements apply to the
determinations of the members of a Board of Appeal, as well as to the
Judgements of Judges.]

[CFJ 1139: Judgements need not necessarily accord with the reasoning
and arguments of Judges or Justices given in past CFJs.]

[CFJ 1219: A mistaken Judgement (ie one that does not accord with the
Rules) is still a Judgement, as long as the technical requirements on
the delivery of the Judgement have been met.]

[CFJ 1671 (called 17 May 2007): The truth or falsity of a statement
can be determined as of the issuance of a CFJ even if public knowledge
at the time of issuance was not sufficient to determine it.]

      Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding

      The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
      be bound by the rules.

      Other rules may further differentiate the treatment of rules
      violations from the treatment of violations of other types of

Rule 1793/3 (Power=1)
Orders

      An Order is a command, executed by an entity and directed to
      some entity requiring that entity to perform exactly one action,
      or to refrain from performing one or more actions.

      An Order may be directed to the holder of an official position
      in eir capacity in that official position, and if the position
      changes hands before the Order is satisfied, the duty to abide
      by the Order automatically attaches to the new holder of that
      position.

      An Order may also be directed at a prior order so as to affect
      the prior order's operation, as the Rules permit.

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class are presumed valid and enforceable until proven
      otherwise by CFJ.

Rule 1794/11 (Power=1)
Classes of Orders

      Each Order is of exactly one of the following classes.  If an
      Order could be of more than one of these classes, then it is of
      the first class that matches.

        (a) A Legislative Order is an Order executed as part of the
            effect of the adoption of a Proposal.

        (b) A Timing Order is an Order which may be executed by any
            person by announcement and directed at any entity.  A
            timing order is valid if and only if it orders the entity
            to perform, as soon as possible, a duty specifically
            required of em by the Rules that does not otherwise have a
            specified timing requirement, or for which the otherwise
            specified timing requirement will have been exceeded as
            soon as possible after the Order is executed.

      No other types of Orders are valid.

Rule 1795/6 (Power=1)
Order Timing

      Orders to perform an action shall be satisfied as soon as
      possible, unless the Order specifies a different time limit.  The
      minimum time limit is 72 hours after the Order takes effect; any
      time limit that would be shorter is extended to the minimum.

      If an Order to perform an action is directed to an Office or other
      position of authority, and the holder of that position changes
      after the Order takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied,
      then the time limit is extended (if needed) to one week after the
      change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1799/3 (Power=1)
Stay and Vacation of Orders

      The effect of staying an Order is to temporarily prevent the
      stayed Order from having any effect.

      A stay may be specified to expire after a fixed time.  If no
      specification is made in the Order to Stay, the stay shall not
      expire.

      When the stay expires or is vacated, the previously stayed order
      again has effect as if it had been originally executed at the
      moment the stay ceases to be effective.  However, if at the time
      the staying Order expires or otherwise ceases to have effect,
      the stayed Order has been vacated or is subject to another
      staying Order, it does not regain effect.

      The effect of vacating an Order is to permanently deny the
      vacated Order from having any effect.  Vacating an Order to
      Vacate reinstates the ability of the vacated Order to have
      effect, as of the moment the Order to Vacate is itself vacated.

      Any Order may always be stayed or vacated by the Player (or, in
      the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal) who executed it.
      Certain classes of Orders may be stayed or vacated in other
      circumstances as well, but only as the Rules allow.

Rule 1810/6 (Power=1)
Satisfying Orders

      An Order requiring an entity to perform an action is satisfied
      when that entity performs that action.  Other Rules may define
      other ways for Orders to be satisfied.  Except when otherwise
      specified, a single action can result in the satisfaction of at
      most one Order.  If an action would satisfy more than one Order,
      and no other specification is made, the Action satisfies the
      oldest Order which it would satisfy.

      A player SHALL NOT willfully perform contrary to a valid
      unsatisfied order, either through action or inaction.

      its Protectorates. The Ambassador's report shall include a
      listing of Protectorates as well as a list of recent events
      related to those Protectorates. On a minimum of a monthly basis,
      the Ambassador shall review each Protectorate to ensure it meets
      the requirements of a Protectorate.

      The Ambassador may act on behalf of Agora for an action that is
      permitted of Agora in the Protectorate's ruleset, with the
      exception of direct changes to that Protectorate's ruleset as
      described above. Any Player may, with Agoran consent, require
      that the Ambassador act or not act in a specified fashion in
      relation to a Protectorate.

[Cross-references (18 July 2007): the Ambassador's duties are:

      In order to become a Protectorate, a nomic must specify in its
      ruleset that it submits to Agora as its benevolent protector. It
      also must allow Agora unrestricted access to make changes to its
      ruleset. A player of said nomic may then cause that nomic to
      become a Protectorate by announcement to the public forum. A
      nomic that no longer meets these requirements ceases to be a
      Protectorate.

      Agora shall treat a Protectorate in a benevolent fashion, making
      changes to that nomic's ruleset only for the purpose of
      assisting that nomic in its growth and enabling its longevity.
      Agora may only make changes to a Protectorate's ruleset through
      a Proposal with an Adoption Index of 2 or more, although this
      does not prohibit changes made to a Protectorate nomic by one or
      more of its players (or closest equivalent) according to the
      rules of that Protectorate.

[CFJ 1704 (called 17 July 2007): If a nomic is a binding agreement
governed by the rules of Agora, then the possibility of direct
modification of that agreement by an Agoran proposal satisfies the
requirement for protectoratehood that it allow Agora unrestricted
access to make changes to its ruleset.]

Rule 991/7 (Power=2)
Invoking Judgement

      Any person may request formal resolution of a dispute pertaining
      to this Nomic by publishing a Call for Judgement (CFJ).  The
      submission of a CFJ constitutes proof of the existence of such a
      dispute.

      A CFJ should be a single clearly-labeled Statement whose truth
      or falsity can be determined using logical reasoning, assuming
      perfect knowledge.  A CFJ may be accompanied by Arguments,
      Evidence, or other related material; the Judge is encouraged,
      but not required, to take notice of these things.

      it.

      When submitting a CFJ, the caller may bar up to three players
      from judging that CFJ.

Rule 2024/6 (Power=1)
Linked Statements

      Linked CFJs are multiple Calls for Judgement deemed to be
      sufficiently similar that they should have a single judge.

      Linkage is transitive.  When a set of one or more linked CFJs
      change jurisdiction, they remain linked to each other, but
      become unlinked from any other CFJs; they may become linked
      to one or more CFJs within the new jurisdiction.

      Multiple CFJs, submitted in a single message and clearly
      labelled as Linked CFJs, become linked.  The players (if any)
      barred by the caller from judging the first CFJ are the only
      players e may bar from judging the others.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall not assign judges directly to the
      members of a set of Linked CFJs, but shall assign a judge to the
      set, as if it was a single CFJ.  The judge must be eligible to
      judge each member of the set, and is simultaneously assigned
      as judge of each member of the set.

      The judge of a set of Linked CFJs shall submit eir judgement of
      each of those CFJs in a single message.

      A trial judge may remand one or more linked CFJs to the Clerk of
      the Courts by announcement.  E ceases to be their judge.

      A trial judge may transfer one or more of eir CFJs to a second
      trial judge by announcement (identifying one of the second judge's
      CFJs), provided that the second judge consents, and is eligible to
      judge all of them.  The transferred CFJs become linked to the
      second judge's CFJ (and any others to which it is already linked).

[CFJ 1602 (called 10 January 2007): A set of Linked CFJs is an entity
distinct from the individual CFJs from which it is composed.]

Excess CFJs

      A CFJ submitted by a person who has previously submitted five
      or more CFJs during the same Agoran Week as that CFJ is an
      Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the Courts can, by announcement,
      Refuse an Excess CFJ that has not had any judge assigned to it.
      Refusal of an Excess CFJ causes it to cease to be a CFJ.

Rule 1868/6 (Power=1)
Selecting a Judge

      Whenever a CFJ that has not been judged has no trial judge
      assigned, the Clerk of the Courts shall as soon as possible
      assign an eligible judge to it by announcement.  The assigned
      judge remains its trial judge until recused.

      Every active player is eligible to be assigned as a trial judge
      unless made ineligible by the rules.  Entities other than active
      players are always ineligible.

      If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by assigning an
      ineligible judge then the assignment stands.  In this case, the
      Clerk of the Courts may recuse the judge by announcement
      accompanied by a description of eir error.

      When a player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e changes to

      if e is not standing.

      When a player registers, e is lying down.

      The Clerk of the Courts may (without 2 objections) change a
      player to lying down.  E is encouraged to do this only if e
      expects the player to judge CFJs slowly or not at all.

      When the Clerk of the Courts publishes a Notice of Rotation, all
      sitting players change to standing.  The Clerk of the Courts
      shall only do so when all CFJs awaiting trial judge assignment
      have no players eligible to be assigned, and at least one of
      them has at least one player ineligible solely to not standing;
      e shall list all CFJs in the first set, and at least one in the
      second (noting at least one of the relevant players).  However,
      failing to meet these requirements does not deprive the Notice
      of effect.

      A defendant may not be assessed punitive damages for Rules
      Violations any worse than a formal apology, unless a Judge finds
      that evidence for the violation is beyond a reasonable doubt.

      The published Report of an Officer constitutes prima facie
      evidence of the truth of those matters reported therein which
      that Officer is required by law to report.  This presumption may
      be set aside only by clear and convincing evidence to the
      contrary.

           Statement.

Rule 1826/2 (Power=1)
Motions

      A motion is a formal request made by a player to the judge of a
      CFJ.  A motion is made by announcement, which must clearly
      identify the CFJ to which the motion applies.

      The judge of a CFJ must either grant or deny each motion that
      applies to that CFJ within five days of it being made.  If a
      judge fails to grant or deny an applicable motion within five
      days of it being made, the Clerk of the Courts shall recuse the
      judge and assign a new one.  If a motion is made after a case
      has been judged, and the original judge of that case is not
      active or is not a player, then the Clerk of the Courts shall
      assign a new judge.

      A judge grants or denies a motion by publishing eir
      determination, along with any arguments, evidence, or other
      material that e considers relevant.  The effect of granting a
      motion depends on its nature, but generally amounts to requiring
      the judge to perform as requested by the motion.  A denied
      motion has no further effect.

        d) A claim that a Trial Judge has failed to perform a required
           judicial duty.

      A subject is Appealed when any of the following occurs:

        i) Three Players Appeal it.
       ii) A Player Appeals a Judicial Order binding em.
      iii) A Player Appeals a Trial Judgement convicting em of a
           Crime.

      A single subject (e.g. a specific judgement, motion, or order)
      may only be appealed once.

      As soon as possible after an Appeal is initiated, or a Player
      becomes or ceases to be an Appellate judge, the Clerk of the
      Courts shall announce the event.

      An Appeal may be accompanied by Arguments, Evidence, or other
      related material; the Board of Appeals is encouraged, but not
      required, to take notice of these things.

Rule 911/15 (Power=1)
The Board of Appeals

      When an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected to reach a decision about the subject of the Appeal.  A
      Board of Appeals consists of three Appellate Judges.  Any Judge
      assigned according to this Rule is an Appellate Judge.

      A Board of Appeals is selected when the Clerk of the Courts
      correctly announces the identity of all Appellate Judges,
      determined as follows:

        a) The Speaker is selected, if eligible.
        b) The Clerk of the Courts is selected, if eligible.
        c) Any remaining positions are filled by selection by the
           Clerk of the Courts from all remaining eligible Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected for that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed from that Board.
      iii) E has been Trial Judge of the subject of the Appeal.
       iv) E is ineligible to Judge the CFJ at the time of selection.

      An Appellate Judge may appoint another eligible Player as eir
      replacement by informing the Clerk of the Courts, provided the
      Player consents.

      As soon as possible after an Appellate Judge is recused, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall select an eligible Player to replace
      em.

      The last Appellate Judge selected is the Lead Judge for that
      Board.  If the Lead Judge is replaced, then the replacement
      becomes Lead Judge.

Rule 1447/21 (Power=1)
Final Judgement upon Appeal

      For an Appellate Judge assigned to the Appeal of a Judgement,
      a Judgement is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN, REVERSE,
      REASSIGN, or REMAND.  For the appeal of other matters, a Judgement
      is exactly one of the following: SUSTAIN or OVERTURN.  Other Rules
      may modify this based on the subject of the Appeal.

      If a Judgement of TRUE or FALSE is Appealed, the Board of
      Appeals shall consider the correctness of that Judgement.  If a
      Judgement of DISMISSED is Appealed, the Board shall not consider
      the truth or falsity of the original CFJ; they shall only
      consider whether a Judgement of DISMISSED should have been
      delivered.

      If a majority of the Appellate Judges Judge SUSTAIN, then the
      subject of the Appeal is sustained.  Otherwise, it is overturned.
      The Board of Appeals shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are
      necessary to enforce its determination.

      When a Judgement is overturned:

      a) If a majority of the Appellate Judges Judge REVERSE, then the
         CFJ shall be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
         Judgement being that which a majority of the Appellate Judges
         agree on.

      b) If a majority of the Appellate Judges Judge REMAND, then the
         original Judgement shall be ignored, and the Clerk of the
         Courts shall reassign the CFJ to the original Judge as if it
         were being originally assigned. The Judge may not make the
         same Judgement for the same reason.

      c) Otherwise, the original Judgement is ignored, the original
         Judge is recused, and the Clerk of the Courts shall reassign
         the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
         originally assigned. The new Judge cannot make the same
         Judgement as the original Judge for the same reason.

      A Board of Appeals is not considered to have returned a
      Judgement until all of its members have submitted eir
      Judgements.  As soon as possible after this happened, the Clerk
      of the Courts shall announce the Board's decision.

Rule 1804/4 (Power=1)
Appeal of Judicial and Sentencing Orders

      As soon as possible after a Judicial Order is Appealed, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall stay it.  If the Appeal is sustained,
      then the Board of Appeals shall vacate this stay as soon as
      possible.  If the Appeal is overturned, then the Board of
      Appeals shall vacate the stayed Order as soon as possible.

      In the Appeal of a Judicial Order, the Board of Appeals shall
      consider whether the Order was properly and validly executed.

Rule 1805/3 (Power=1)
Appellate Orders

      Appellate Orders are executed by being published by the Lead
      Judge of a Board of Appeals.  The Lead Judge must certify in the
      execution that the order is executed by the concurrence of the
      majority of the Justices comprising that Board of Appeals;
      failure to do so deprives the Order of effect.

      Appellate Orders are not subject to appeal.  However, upon a
      judicial finding that the required certification was falsely
      provided, the Clerk of the Courts shall vacate the Order which
      was accompanied by that false certification.

      Appellate Orders are valid only if addressed to:
        a) The Clerk of the Courts in eir Official capacity;
        b) an Order issued by the Clerk of the Courts in eir Official
           Capacity;
        c) The Judge of the CFJ which that Board of Appeals was
           convened to consider, or any Order issued by that Judge in
           that particular CFJ; or
        d) any combination of the above.
      All other Appellate Orders are presumptively invalid.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall publish each Appellate Order as
      soon as possible after receiving it from the Board of Appeal
      which executed it.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      validity of Appellate Orders.

Rule 1504/9 (Power=1)
Sentencing Orders

      Upon a finding in a Civil CFJ that the defendant has broken one
      or more Rules, the Trial Judge must execute exactly one of the
      following types of sentencing orders as punitive damages:

      (1) Without Objection and with 1 Support, an order the defendant
          to make a formal apology;

      (2) Without 2 Objections and with 2 Supporters, an order for the
          defendant to perform a specified service for the benefit of the
          Agoran community proportionate to the seriousness of the breach;

      (3) An order for the Herald to place the defendant in the Chokey
          for a number of months equal to the power of the highest
          powered Rule that was broken;

      (4) If and only if the trial judge finds the defendant to have
          acted willfully in breaking the rules, an order for the Herald
          to place the defendant in the Chokey for twice number of months
          equal to the power of the highest-powered Rule that was broken;

      (5) If and only if the judge finds the defendant to have acted
          egregiously, maliciously, or with a consistent pattern of
          abuse, with Agoran Consent, an order for the Registrar to
          deregister the defendant in disgrace (make em lawless).  An
          order to be made lawless is automatically appealed upon its
          initial execution.

      These punishments are considered ranked with "worse" punishments
      being later in the list.

      If an attempted sentencing order does not receive the proper
      support or receives too many objections, the trial judge must
      execute another type of sentencing order.

      No other punitive damages may be assessed for Rules violations.

      A sentencing order may require a defendant (hereafter the Ninny)
      to publish a Formal Apology.

      A Formal Apology must be at least 200 words, and must explain
      the Ninny's error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for
      self-improvement.  Furthermore, the Order to Apologize may
      include up to ten Prescribed Words of the Judge's choice, all of
      which must appear in the Formal Apology.

      A defendant must obey an Order to Apologize within 72 hours of
      its execution.

Rule 2129/1 (Power=1)
Dishonor Rolls

      When the Herald is ordered to place someone in the Chokey, e
      shall publically award em the patent title "In the Chokey".

      This title shall be automatically revoked after a length of time
      indicated by the sentencing order, and the Herald shall announce
      the revocation.  If a sentencing order is executed against a
      defendant who already holds this title, the length of time of
      the new sentencing order shall be added to the time left on any
      previous ones.

      A person is considered to be In Disgrace while in the Chokey,
      between the execution and satisfaction of any sentencing orders
      binding em, or if deregistered for lawlessness.  A person who
      leaves the game in disgrace shall be awarded the Patent Title
      Fugitive by the Herald.  A Player may revoke the title Fugitive
      from emself as long as e is no longer in Disgrace.  A non-player
      may have this title revoked by Agoran Consent.

      The rules may further specify actions prohibited to persons in
      particular types of disgrace.

      The Herald is encouraged to publish lists of those in disgrace
      separate from patent titles of honor, to indicate the disgrace.

Rule 1742/8 (Power=1)
Agreements
d3289 13
a3301 68
      Persons may make agreements among themselves with the intention
      that such agreements will be binding; i.e. that they become
      parties to the agreement and agree to be bound by the agreement.

      A CFJ that alleges that a specific person (the defendant) has
      broken an agreement is a Civil CFJ, for which the caller is the
      plaintiff.

      The defendant of a Civil CFJ is automatically barred from
      judging it.  The plaintiff may bar one other player when e
      submits the CFJ, but is not otherwise at that time permitted or
      able to bar any players from judging the CFJ, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  The defendant may bar one other
      player from judging, any time before the CFJ is assigned to a
      judge.

      Any evidence or arguments, published or submitted to the CotC by
      the defendant of a Civil CFJ with the clear intent of being part
      of a defense, any time before the CFJ is assigned to a judge,
      will become part of the material of that CFJ.

      When a Civil CFJ is submitted, the Clerk of the Courts shall as
      soon as possible send a copy of the CFJ to the defendant and
      inform the defendant that e has one week to publish a defense
      and/or bar a Player from judging. The CotC is prohibited from
      assigning a Trial Judge to a Civil CFJ until one week has passed
      since e notified the defendant of this, and is not obliged to
      assign a Trial Judge during this time, any rule to the contrary
      notwithstanding.  Starting from one week after the CotC has
      notified the defendant, the CotC is obliged to assign a Trial
      Judge as soon as possible, and this assignment shall in all
      other respects be governed by the usual rules for assignment of
      judges.

      If the judge of a Civil CFJ finds that the agreement was entered
      into with the intention that the agreement be binding, and that
      the agreement has in fact been broken, then e may do any or all
      of the following:

         (i) order the defendant to perform according to the agreement
             or perform substitute acts that would fairly serve the
             interests of the agreement;

        (ii) order the other parties of the agreement to perform such
             acts as may be necessary to preserve fairness and
             justice;

       (iii) order that additional ("punitive") penalties or actions
             be applied to the defendant, if and only if the agreement
             in question explicitly specifies punitive penalties for
             the type of breach.

      A Civil CFJ that specifies multiple defendants, or multiple
      independent breaches of contract, is improperly made and shall
      be dismissed.

      Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a person to violate
      another agreement.

[CFJ 1658 (called 11 May 2007): The word "contract" is by default a
synonym for "binding agreement".]

[CFJ 1682 (called 23 May 2007): A binding agreement under rule 1742
cannot be made among a set of exactly one player.]

[CFJ 1683 (called 23 May 2007): A binding agreement under rule 1742
cannot be made among a set of exactly zero players (the empty set).]
a3305 8
[CFJs 1666-1667 (called 14 May 2007): Where two binding agreements
each construct a partnership, the partnerships have distinct
identities even if the set of partners is the same.]

[CFJ 1668 (called 14 May 2007): Where a binding agreement constructs a
partnership and allows the set of partners to change, the identity of
the partnership remains the same across changes of partners.]

      If the Speaker is neither the Chair nor the Candidate, the Speaker
      shall appoint a Player who is neither the Chair nor the Candidate to
      be the second Committee member.  Otherwise, the Clerk of the Courts
      shall so appoint.  The two Committee members shall then select,
      by mutual consent, a third person who is not the Candidate to be
      the third Committee member.

      The Committee shall examine the Candidate and eir Thesis to
      determine eir qualifications for the Degree.  The Chair of the
      Thesis Committee may award that Degree to the Candidate if and
      only if:

      * the Candidate has satisfied all prerequisites in the Rules for
        the award of that Degree;
      * a majority of members of the Thesis Committee agree that the
        Thesis is worthy of the Degree to be granted.  Attention
        should be paid to the originality and strength of the work, as
        well as the extent of the work with regard to the expectations
        of the particular degree.  The committee may award a lesser
        degree if appropriate; and
      * fewer than seven years have passed since that Committee was
        formed.

      Each Committee Member may publish a Commentary for the Thesis.
      The Rulekeepor shall retain a copy of each Thesis that has
      resulted in a degree, along with all such Commentaries.

Voting Limits

      An entity's voting limit on an Agoran decision is:

        (a) If the entity is not an eligible voter, then zero, not
            subject to modification.

        (b) Otherwise, if the decision is to resolve an ordinary
            proposal, then one, subject to modification by the rules.

        (c) Otherwise, one, subject to modification only by this rule.

      The voting limit of an entity who is not a first-class person is
      reduced by one.

      At the end of the voting period of an Agoran decision, the first
      N ballots submitted by each entity on that decision (where N is
      the entity's voting limit at the decision's ballot allotment
      time) remain valid; all other ballots submitted on that decision
      are invalid.

      The ballot allotment time of a proposal that becomes or ceases
      to be ordinary during the proposal's voting period is the time
      of the last such change.  The ballot allotment time of any other
      decision is the start of the voting period.

      The Promotor is permitted to distribute a proposal in the
      Proposal Pool at any time.  During each week, the Promotor must
      distribute each proposal in the proposal pool which was in the
      Proposal Pool at the beginning of the week.

      The Promotor legally distributes a proposal by publishing it
      accompanied by an explicit indication that it is being
      distributed.  When a proposal is distributed, it is removed from
      the Proposal Pool.  The distribution of a proposal initiates the
      Agoran decision of whether to adopt the proposal, as described
      elsewhere.

      The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
      proposal the identity of its proposer, the proposal's coauthors,
      if any, its chamber, and its adoption index.  However, the
      failure of the Promotor to include any of these with a proposal
      does not deprive the distribution of the proposal of any legal

      affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  A player's VC is at
      all times a non-negative integer.  VCs are not any form of
      property and cannot be traded.  VCs can be affected only as
      described in this rule.

      When one or more players win the game, all players' voting
      limits on ordinary proposals are reset to one, subject to
      modification by other rules.

      When a player joins Agora, eir VCs are set to zero and eir
      voting limit on ordinary proposals is set to one.

      When an Ordinary Interested proposal is adopted and its proposer
      is not the proposer of any Ordinary Interested proposal
      previously adopted in the same week, its proposer gains VCs
      equal to the integer portion of twice the proposal's adoption
      index, and each co-author of the proposal gains one VC.

      At the end of each month, for each office, the player (if any)
      who held that office for the majority of that month gains two
      VCs, unless the Speaker publicly announces that the officer has
      performed poorly in eir duties.

      A player who submits a judgement during eir Deliberation Period
      gains one VC.  A player whose judgement is overturned, or who
      is recused for failing to judge within eir Deliberation Period,
      loses one VC, if e has any.

      A player may expend two VCs to increase eir own voting limit on
      ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend one VC to increase any other player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend two VCs to decrease any other player's
      voting limit on ordinary proposals by one, down to a minimum
      voting limit of zero.  Attempts to decrease a player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals below this minimum fail.

      Points are a measure of a player's contentiousness.  The number
      of points possessed by a player is eir score, which is always an
      integer.  When a player registers, eir score is set to zero.

      A contestmaster may award a total of up to 10 points per month
      to one or more contestants, unless e was contestmaster of a
      different contest for at least 15 days of the previous month.

      A player with 100 or more points may announce this fact.  If
      this announcement is correct, then the following events happen:

      For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
      players simultaneously winning, then any player may announce
      that the winning cardinal becomes a pope.  Upon this
      announcement, that player becomes a pope, so please treat em
      right good forever.  Also upon this announcement, the current
      Speaker ceases to be Speaker, and the new pope is installed as
      the new Speaker.

      If the legality of an installation is not challenged within
      seven days of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to
      stand, even if is subsequently found to be illegal.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, if a Player becomes
      Speaker via this method, e may not be removed from the
      Speakership for 90 days without eir own consent.

      If no cardinal has become a pope in the past six months, or a judge
      finds that the current Speaker has been inactive, inattentive,

          (1) all non-barred players become eligible to judge that
              CFJ; then

          (2) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then all
              barred players, other than the caller emself, become
              eligible to judge that increasingly annoying CFJ; then

          (3) if there is still no player eligible to judge, then
              don't panic.  Somebody's bound to register someday; let
              em deal with it.

      (c) This rule takes precedence over other rules concerning who
          is and is not eligible to judge CFJs.

[CFJ 1600 (called 10 January 2007): In Rule 698 the phrase "all barred
players" means all Players that are Barred from Judging the
increasingly annoying CFJ.]

[CFJ 1601 (called 10 January 2007): When a Judge is to be assigned to
a set of Linked CFJs as required by Rule 2024, references in Rule 698
to "that CFJ" or "that increasingly annoying CFJ" refer to individual
CFJs, not to the set of CFJs.]

      no players eligible to be assigned, and at least one of them has
      at least one player ineligible solely to not standing; e shall
      list all CFJs in the first set, and at least one in the second

Pragmatic Judicial Assignments

      If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by assigning an
      ineligible judge, then the selection stands.  However, if the
      player has not yet delivered judgement, then the Clerk of the
      Courts may point out eir error and recuse the player.

      A Motion is a formal request made by a Player to the Judge of a
      CFJ.  A Motion is made by submitting it to the Clerk of the
      Courts, clearly identifying the CFJ to which the Motion applies.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall forward each properly-filed Motion
      to the Judge of the CFJ to which the Motion applies as soon as
      possible after receiving it.  A Judge must either grant or deny
      each Motion so forwarded within five days of receiving it.  A
      Judge grants or denies a Motion by sending eir determination on
      that Motion to the Clerk of the Courts, along with any reasons e
      chooses to provide.

      The effect of granting a Motion depends on its nature, but
      generally amounts to requiring the Judge to perform as requested
      by the Motion.

      Upon receipt of a Judge's determination on a Motion, the Clerk
      shall note the determination made and the reasons, if any, on
      the record of the CFJ, and shall notify the Player who made the
      Motion of that determination.

      If a Judge fails to Grant or Deny a Motion within five days of
      when it was forwarded to em by the Clerk of the Courts, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall Recuse the Judge and assign a new one
      as usual.

      If a Motion is made after a case is closed, and the original
      Judge of that case is not active or is not a player, then a new
      Judge shall be assigned to the case as usual.

      effect until their publication by the Clerk of the Courts.  The
      Lead Judge must certify in the execution that the order is
      executed by the concurrence of the majority of the Justices
      comprising that Board of Appeals; failure to do so deprives the
      Order of effect.

      A non-natural person that is created by an Agreement between two
      or more persons is known as a Partnership. A Partnership comes
      into existence with the initiation of the Agreement that creates
      it, and it ceases to exist when that Agreement is terminated.
      The persons who are party to the Agreement may change during the
      course of that Agreement (if the Agreement allows for it)
      without disrupting the existence of the Partnership as a person
      as long as that Agreement remains in effect.

      Agora recognizes an agreement that implicitly or explicitly
      assigns its rights, obligations, and responsibilities onto the
      parties of that agreement to be a non-natural person.

[CFJ 1691 (called 20 June 2007): The first paragraph of rule 2145
implicitly accepts that agreements do in fact create non-natural
persons, provided that those agreements are compatible with the
rules.]

      The current Speaker may, with two supporters, invite players to

      who wins the game.  The contest must be open to all players.
      Winners determined by the procedures of the contest do in fact
      win the game.  When the initiating Speaker ceases to be Speaker,
      the contest loses the legal authority to determine winners.

      player changes the officeholder in this way during the following
      quarter.

Rule 1727/16 (Power=1)
Happy Birthday

      WHEREAS, in June 1993, the world's only MUD-based nomic, Nomic
      World, had recently collapsed; yet, many of its players enjoyed
      nomic and did not wish to forego such a noble pursuit;

      And WHEREAS, Originator Chuck Carroll therefore composed an
      Initial Ruleset for an email nomic, based on the Initial
      Rulesets of Peter Suber, inventor of Nomic, and on the Rulesets
      of Nomic World and other nomics,

      And WHEREAS, a nomic thus rose like a phoenix from the ashes of
      Nomic World, played on the mailing list originally set up for
      discussion of Nomic World, and coming into existence at June 30,
      1993, 00:04:30 GMT +1200, with a message sent by FIRST SPEAKER
      Michael Norrish, which read, in part,

          "I see no reason to let this get bogged down; there are no
          precedents or rules that cover this situation, so I think we
          may as well begin directly.... Proposals for new rules are
          invited. In accordance with the rules, these will be
          published, numbered and distributed by me at my earliest
          convenience."

      And WHEREAS, this nomic began as a humble and nameless nomic, known
      unofficially as yoyo, after the mailing list it was played on,
      until its Players, much later, gave it its OFFICIAL NAME of Agora,

      And WHEREAS, Agora has now become the wisest, noblest, eldest,
      and most interesting of all active email nomics, due to the hard
      work and diligence of Agorans as well as the frequent advice of
      Agoraphobes,

      And WHEREAS, Agorans desire to joyously commemorate Agora's
      founding,

      BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that Agora's Birthday is defined to be
      the entire day of June 30, GMT +1200, of each year.

      Rule violation shall be treated as the violation of a binding
      agreement to be bound by the Rule or Rules in question.

      The proposal, fora, and registration processes shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to making and changing the agreement to
      be bound by the rules.

      Other rules may further differentiate the treatment of rules
      violations from the treatment of violations of other types of
      agreements.

Honorary Degrees

      A degree may be awarded by the operation of an adopted Proposal
      whose Power is at least two to any person who is not registered
      as a Player and who does not already bear that degree.  The
      Proposal must specify both the recipient of the degree and the
      degree to be awarded.  For a degree to be awarded in this
      manner, the recipient need not complete a Thesis, but all other
      requirements specific to the degree in question must be
      satisfied.

      Degrees awarded as described in this rule shall be marked as
      honorary degrees in the Herald's report.  A person bearing an
      honorary degree may still be awarded the same degree by other
      rule-defined mechanisms.  When this occurs, the person shall
      cease to bear the honorary degree and shall bear the new degree
      in its place.

Applications

      An Application is any document, which has been submitted as an

      receive Applications of that particular type.  The submitter is
      known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor before submission.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

Agoran Contracts

      There exists a type of binding agreement known as Agoran
      Contract.  An Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by
      a Proposal and becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect.

      Unless otherwise specified in the Rules, all Players are bound
      by Agoran Contracts and no Player may leave an Agoran Contract
      while remaining a Player.  The Proposal process shall, prima
      facie, be considered to be protective of a Player's rights and
      privileges with respect to agreements.

      All Rules regulating Contracts that are inconsistent with this
      Rule are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.

      The CotC's monthly report includes all Agoran Contracts.

Legislative Orders

      (a) A Proposal may contain one or more Orders.

      (b) The effect of adopting a Proposal which contains Orders is
          to execute those Orders.  Such Orders are known as
          Legislative Orders, and are executed by that Proposal as
          of the date of the proclamation of the Proposal's adoption.

      (c) Legislative Orders may not be stayed, vacated, or amended
          except:
        (1) by a subsequent Legislative Order;
        (2) by a Judicial Order issued only after a judicial finding
            that the Proposal containing the Legislative Order was not
            adopted, was barred from taking effect, or was invalid; or
        (3) by the Clerk of the Courts, but only for the purpose of
            staying such an Order during the pendency of a dispute
            which might reasonably lead to a judicial finding of the
            sort mentioned in subdivision (c)(2) of this Rule.

Orders to Compel

      Upon a judicial finding that a Player has failed to perform a

      execute an Order, requiring that Player to perform that duty as
      soon as possible.  Such an Order is known as an Order to Compel.

      If the duty in question arises because the Player in question
      holds a specific Office or other position of official
      responsibility, the Order shall be directed to that Office or
      position.  If the Player holding that Office fails to perform
      the duty in question as ordered, the Judge shall Order that that
      Player be removed from Office or position.

No Compulsion of Judges

      Any Order to Compel directed to a Judge, or requiring the
      performance of a duty required of a Player because that Player
      is a Judge, is invalid, unless that Order is a valid Appellate
      Order.

      Any CFJ alleging that a Judgement is incorrect, or that a Judge
      has failed to perform a judicial duty, lacks standing.  Such a
      claim should instead be pursued via Appeal.

Orders to Annotate Rules

      The Judge of any CFJ, the Statement of which alleges that a Rule
      should be interpreted in a certain way, which is judged TRUE
      or FALSE, may, at eir discretion, issue an Order requiring the
      Rulekeepor to annotate the Rule in question accordingly.  If the
      CFJ was judged TRUE then the annotation shall be the Statement
      of the CFJ, and if the CFJ was judged FALSE then the annotation
      shall be the contrary of the Statement of the CFJ.  Such an
      annotation, while it exists, shall guide application of that Rule.

      The Rulekeepor may remove such an annotation only if that Rule
      is repealed; if required to do so by a valid Order; or if the
      original Order to annotate is amended, stayed, or vacated.  The
      Rulekeepor may vacate an Order to annotate a Rule Without
      Objection.  Annotations to a Rule may not be modified in any way
      except as specified in this Rule.

      If a Player believes that an annotation is no longer pertinent,
      e may file, in the original CFJ from which the Order of
      Annotation arises, a Motion to Vacate the Order of Annotation.
      If such a Motion is granted, the Judge granting it shall Order
      the original Order Vacated and shall Order the Rulekeepor to
      remove the annotation in question.

[CFJ 684: Such an Order applies not only during Judging, but also in
the everyday interpretation of the Rule.]

Turns for All

      When a player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e becomes
      turned.  A player is ineligible to be Trial Judge of a CFJ if
      e was turned when it was called.

      When a player registers, e becomes turned.

      The Clerk of the Courts may (without 2 objections) turn a
      player.  E is encouraged to do this only if e expects the
      player to judge CFJs slowly or not at all.
d2644 8
a2651 7
      players become unturned.  The Clerk of the Courts shall only do
      so when all open CFJs without a Trial Judge have no players
      eligible to be assigned, and at least one of them has at least
      one player ineligible solely to being turned; e shall list all
      CFJs in the first set, and at least one (and at least one such
      player for it) in the second.  However, failing to meet these
      requirements does not deprive the Notice of effect.

Rule 105/2 (Power=3)
Rule Changes

      Where permitted by other rules, an instrument generally can,
      as part of its effect,

      (a) enact a rule.  The new rule has power equal to the minimum
          of the power specified by the enacting instrument,
          defaulting to one if the enacting instrument does not
          specify, and the maximum power permitted by other rules.
          The enacting instrument may specify a title for the new
          rule, which if present shall prevail.  The number of the
          new rule cannot be specified by the enacting instrument;
          any attempt to so specify is null and void.

      (b) repeal a rule.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to be a
          rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
          of it.

      (c) amend the text of a rule.

      (d) retitle a rule.

      (e) change the power of a rule.

      A rule change is any effect that falls into the above classes.
      Rule changes always occur sequentially, never simultaneously.

      Any ambiguity in the specification of a rule change causes
      that change to be void and without effect.  A variation in
      whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of an existing
      rule does not constitute ambiguity for the purposes of this
      rule, but any other variation does.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      created, modified, or destroyed, or by which an entity can
      become a rule or cease to be a rule.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

[CFJ 1644 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of words
"Change the power of rule NNNN to P and amend it by XXX.", where XXX
specifies a text change, this constitutes two attempted rule changes.]

[CFJ 1638 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of words
"Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Amend rule NNNN by YYY.", this constitutes
two separate attempts at rule changes, even though both attempt to amend
the same rule.]

[CFJ 1642 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of words
"Amend rule NNNN by XXX.  Further amend rule NNNN by YYY.", where both
XXX and YYY specify text changes, this constitutes two separate attempts
at rule changes.]

[CFJ 1640 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of words
"Amend rule NNNN by XXX and YYY.", where both XXX and YYY specify text
changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule change, even though
it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1641 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal contains the form of words
"Amend rule NNNN by XXX and by YYY.", where both XXX and YYY specify
text changes, this constitutes a single attempt at a rule change, even
though it is specified in two parts.]

[CFJ 1643 (29 April 2007): Where a proposal specifies a single rule
amendment in two parts, and one of the parts is not possible but the
other is possible, the possible part is applied alone.]

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
d1903 2
a1904 1
      A proposal generally can, as part of its effect:
d1906 27
a1932 22
      (a) Enact a rule.  When a rule is enacted, the Rulekeepor shall
      assign it a number, which must be greater than any number
      previously assigned.  If the enacting proposal does not specify
      the power, the rule shall have power equal to one.  If the
      proposal specifies the power, then the rule shall have power
      equal to the minimum of four, the power of the proposal, and the
      power specified by the proposal.  If the title is not specified,
      the Rulekeepor may select any title e sees fit.

      (b) Modify the power, title, or text of a rule.  A Proposal can
      modify the power, title, or text of a rule with power no greater
      than its own.  However, a proposal cannot cause a rule to have
      power greater than its own.  Any ambiguity in a modification
      specified by a proposal causes that modification to be void and
      without effect.  A variation in whitespace or capitalization in
      the quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity
      for the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

      (c) Repeal a rule.  A Proposal can repeal a rule with power no
      greater than its own.  When a proposal repeals a rule, it ceases
      to be a rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
      of it.
d1935 2
a1936 5
      enacted, modified, or repealed.

CFJ 1626: A rule cannot directly enact, modify, or repeal a rule
(including itself), unless it takes precedence over the last paragraph
of Rule 105.

Definition and Continuity of Entities

      No two Rule-defined entities shall have the same name or

      such that they no longer define that entity, then that
      entity along with all its properties shall cease to exist.

      If the Rules defining an entity are amended such that they

      that entity and its properties shall continue to exist to
      whatever extent is possible under the new definitions.

Rule 1607/12 (Power=1)
The Promotor

      The Promotor is an office; its holder is responsible for
      receiving and distributing proposals.

      The Promotor is permitted to distribute a proposal in the
      Proposal Pool at any time.  During each week, the Promotor must
      distribute each proposal in the proposal pool which was in the
      Proposal Pool at the beginning of the week.

      The Promotor legally distributes a proposal by publishing it
      accompanied by an explicit indication that it is being
      distributed.  When a proposal is distributed, it is removed from
      the Proposal Pool.  The distribution of a proposal initiates the
      Agoran decision of whether to adopt the proposal, as described
      elsewhere.

      The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
      proposal the identity of its proposer, the proposal's coauthors,
      if any, its chamber, and its adoption index.  However, the
      failure of the Promotor to include any of these with a proposal
      does not deprive the distribution of the proposal of any legal
      effect.

  This Category's rules describe how Agora makes its decisions
a1571 53
Rule 2126/3 (Power=3)
Voting Credits

      Voting Credits (VCs) are a measure of each player's ability to
      affect voting limits on ordinary proposals.  A player's VC is at
      all times a non-negative integer.  The Promotor is the
      recordkeepor of VCs.  VCs are not any form of property and
      cannot be traded.  VCs can be affected only as described in this
      rule.

      When one or more players win the game, all players' voting
      limits on ordinary proposals are reset to one, subject to
      modification by other rules.

      When a player joins Agora, eir VCs are set to zero.

      When a proposal is adopted, its proposer gains VCs equal to the
      integer portion of the proposal's adoption index, and each
      co-author of the proposal gains one VC.

      At the end of each quarter, for each office, the player (if
      any) who held that office for the majority of that quarter
      gains one VC.

      A player who submits a judgement during eir Deliberation Period
      gains one VC.  A player whose judgement is overturned loses one
      VC, if e has any.

      A player may expend two VCs to increase eir own voting limit on
      ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend one VC to increase any other player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals by one.

      A player may expend two VCs to decrease any other player's
      voting limit on ordinary proposals by one, down to a minimum
      voting limit of zero.  Attempts to decrease a player's voting
      limit on ordinary proposals below this minimum fail.

      If a player attempts to expend more VCs than e currently has,
      the action fails, and the VCs are not expended.

      Changes to voting limits under this rule take effect at the
      beginning of the next week.

Honorary Degrees

      A degree may be awarded by the operation of an adopted Proposal
      whose Power is at least two to any person who is not registered
      as a Player and who does not already bear that degree.  The
      Proposal must specify both the recipient of the degree and the
      degree to be awarded.  For a degree to be awarded in this
      manner, the recipient need not complete a Thesis, but all other
      requirements specific to the degree in question must be
      satisfied.

      Degrees awarded as described in this rule shall be marked as
      honorary degrees in the Herald's report.  A person bearing an
      honorary degree may still be awarded the same degree by other
      rule-defined mechanisms.  When this occurs, the person shall
      cease to bear the honorary degree and shall bear the new degree
      in its place.

      Linked CFJs are multiple Calls for Judgement that are submitted

d2055 15
a2069 14
      When submitting Linked CFJs, the players (if any) barred by the
      caller from judging the first CFJ are the only players e may bar
      from judging any of the other CFJs.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall assign a Judge to a set of Linked
      CFJs, as if they were a single CFJ.  The Judge must be eligible
      to Judge each of the Linked CFJs, and is simultaneously assigned
      as Judge of each of the Linked CFJs.

      A Judge (the first judge) may transfer a CFJ to a second judge
      by announcement, thus linking the first and second CFJs and
      unlinking the first CFJ with any it was previously linked to,
      with the second judge's consent and provided the second judge
      has not been barred or recused from the first CFJ.

      If one or more Linked CFJs beyond the first are unrelated in
      subject matter to the first, then a Trial Judge may remand those
      CFJs to the Clerk of the Courts; e ceases to be Judge of those
      CFJs.

      If a Trial Judge is recused from a Linked CFJ, then it ceases to
      be Linked to any other CFJ.  If a Trial Judge is recused from
      two or more Linked CFJs in a single message, or if a Trial Judge
      is simultaneously and automatically recused from two or more
      Linked CFJs, then those CFJs continue to be Linked to each
      other, but not to any other CFJs to which the Judge is still
      assigned.
d2077 5
a2081 3
      A CFJ made by a person who has previously made five or more CFJs
      during the same Agoran Week is an Excess CFJ.  The Clerk of the
      Courts may dismiss any Excess CFJ.
d2090 13
d2194 1
a2194 1
Rule 1871/8 (Power=1)
d2197 18
a2214 19
      Whenever a player is selected as Trial Judge of a CFJ, e becomes
      turned.  Turned players are ineligible to be Trial Judge of any
      future CFJs.  When a player registers, e is considered turned.

      Whenever an open CFJ has no Trial Judge assigned to it, and
      there are no players eligible to be assigned, the Clerk of the
      Courts shall publish a Notice of Rotation, specifying at least
      one such CFJ.  Upon such an announcement, all turned players
      become unturned.

      The CotC may turn a player e expects to judge CFJs slowly or not
      at all, without 2 objections.

      If the Clerk of the Courts errs in good faith by selecting a
      Player to Judge a CFJ or Appeal who is not eligible to judge
      that CFJ or Appeal solely because e is turned, then that
      selection shall stand, unless the Clerk of the Courts points out
      eir error and makes a new selection before the selected Player
      returns Judgement.

      as soon as possible after a substantial change occurs in the
      information or the officer receives a request for the
      information.  A weekly report shall be sufficient to satisfy
      these last two requirements.
d965 1
d1877 1

Rule 1795/5 (Power=1)
d1880 10
a1889 16
      An Order may specify the time limit for the performance of an
      ordered action.  If a time limit is less than 72 hours after the
      Order takes effect, the time limit shall be 72 hours.  If no
      time limit is specified, time limit shall be as soon as possible
      after the Order takes effect.

      If an Order which commands the performance of an action is
      directed to an Office or other position of authority, and the
      holder of that position of authority changes after the Order
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, then the
      current holder shall have as soon as possible to satisfy that
      order.

      The noncompliance of an order with this Rule does not deprive
      that order of all effect, but instead modifies the timing
      requirements of the order.

      For an Appelate Judge assigned to the Appeal of a Judgement, a

      REASSIGN, or REMAND.  For the appeal of other matters, a

        a) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REVERSE, then

           with the Judgement being that which a majority of the
           Appelate Judges agree on.

        b) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REASSIGN, then
           the original Judgement is ignored, the original Judge is
           recused, and the Clerk of the Courts shall reassign the CFJ
           to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was originally
           assigned.  The new Judge cannot make the same Judgement as
           the original Judge for the same reason.

        c) If a majority of the Appelate Judges Judge REMAND, then the
           original Judgement shall be ignored, and the Clerk of the
           Courts shall reassign the CFJ to the original Judge as if
           it were being originally assigned. The Judge may not make

Rule 1686/16 (Power=1)
Official Reports

      The Rules may designate certain information to be part of an
      Office's Weekly Report, Bi-Weekly Report or Monthly Report.  An
      Office's Weekly Reports, Bi-Weekly Reports and Monthly Reports
      constitute the Office's Official Report.  All information that
      is part of an Office's Official Report shall be maintained by
      the corresponding officer.

      Each officer with a Weekly Report must publish it weekly unless
      the content of the report would substantially be the same as in
      the previously published report. In this case, a report must
      only be published within one week of the next substantial change
      to the report's content, but must at least be published once per
      month.  Each officer with a Bi-Weekly Report must publish it
      once every two weeks and each officer with a Monthly Report must
      publish it monthly.  Failure to do so is the Class 2 Infraction
      of Failure to Report.  If an officer fails to do so for at least
      three consecutive reporting periods, e may be cited for either
      Failure to Report or the Class 10 Infraction of Dereliction of
      Duty but not both.  Any officer cited for Dereliction of Duty is
      immediately removed from that office. The Associate Director of
      Personnel and the Speaker may report these Infractions.

Rule 1431/16 (Power=1)
Claims of Error

      A Claim of Error is a public message claiming that a specific
      public communication misrepresents the actual Game State, and
      documenting the nature of the error.  The person who sent the
      original communication is hereafter known as the Journalist, and
      the portion of the communication claimed to be in error is
      hereafter known as the Yellow Document.

      A Response to a Claim of Error is a public message from the
      Journalist that either admits or denies the claim.  An admission
      is not valid until the Journalist posts a corrected version of
      the Yellow Document.

      If the Journalist was required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e must publish a
      Response as soon as possible, unless one of the following holds:

        a) E has already published a correction.
        b) A previous Claim was made concerning the same error.
        c) The Claim was posted more than three weeks after the Yellow
           Document.
        d) The Claim is in dispute.  If the Claim ceases to be in
           dispute, then the Journalist must publish a Response as
           soon as possible after it ceases to be in dispute.

      If the Journalist was not required by the Rules to publish the
      information in the Yellow Document, then e is encouraged (but
      not required) to publish a Response in a timely fashion.

      A Player who incorrectly denies a Claim commits the Class 1
      Crime of Implausible Deniability.  However, if e admits the
      Claim within three days after the incorrect denial, then e shall
      not be convicted of this Crime.

[CFJ 919: A PF message correcting an earlier PF message by the
 same player constitutes both a COE and the Response.]

Rule 1551/6 (Power=3)
d946 4
a949 22
      A document required to be maintained and published by a player
      can be ratified if and only if:

      (a) the correctness of the document is not under dispute;

      (b) the information within the document has not been superseded
          by a subsequent document which contradicts it and whose
          correctness is not under dispute; and

      (c) the document is not the ruleset.

      If a player attempts to ratify a document, or a legislative
      order executed by the adoption of a proposal would ratify a
      document, then that document is not ratified unless it can be
      ratified.

      The electee to an office is permitted to ratify, without
      objection, an official report e produced and was required to
      maintain by virtue of holding that office.  The Speaker is
      permitted to ratify, without objection, any official report.  In
      either case, a claim of error on such a report shall be deemed
      to constitute an objection to ratification.

      A Player who wins an Election for an Office, or is installed
      into Office by a Proposal, becomes the Electee to that Office,
      as well as its holder.

      When the Electee to an Office is retired from that Office, e
      ceases to be the Electee to that Office, but continues to hold
      the Office.
d992 1
a992 13
      When the Electee to an Office is removed from that Office, e

      currently holds the Office, the Speaker becomes the holder of
      that Office, unless another Rule provides that a different
      Player is to hold the Office.

      When a non-Electee is removed from an Office and there is an
      Electee to that Office, then the Electee becomes the holder of
      the Office. If there is no Electee, the Office is held by the
      Speaker.

      Whenever a player deregisters, is deregistered, or ceases to be
      active, e is removed from all Offices e holds.

      Objection, that that Player holds that Office in perpetuity.
      The Player then holds the Office in perpetuity.

      The Term of Service of an Office held in perpetuity shall never
      expire, and a Player holding an Office in perpetuity continues
      to hold the Office in perpetuity while e holds the Office.  If
      a Player holding an Office in perpetuity delegates the Office
      to another Player, and e is still the Electee to the Office at
      the end of the Period of Delegation, then e resumes holding the
      Office in perpetuity.

      This Rule takes precedence over other Rules defining the expiry
      of an Office's Term of Service.

Temporary Delegation of Office

      An Office is Delegated when all of these conditions are met:

        (a) The holder (hereafter known as the Delegating Player)
            publishes a Notice of Delegation, naming the Office,
            another Player (hereafter known as the Delegated Player),
            and a Period of Delegation no longer than three weeks.

        (b) The Delegating Player is Electee to the Office, or is the
            Speaker.  This condition must hold when e publishes the
            Notice of Delegation, and must also hold at the beginning
            of the Period of Delegation.

        (c) The Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
            Office at the beginning of the Period of Delegation.

        (d) The Delegated Player consents to the Delegation within
            seven days of the publication of the Notice of Delegation.

        (e) The Period of Delegation has begun and not yet ended.

      The Period of Delegation begins when the Notice of Delegation is
      published, or when consent is given, or at the time (if any)
      specified in the Notice of Delegation, whichever is latest.

      The Period of Delegation ends after the duration specified in
      the Notice of Delegation has elapsed, or when a Player other
      than the Delegating Player becomes Electee to the Office.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player holds the
      Office, and earns its Salary as specified by other Rules.

      At the end of the Period of Delegation, if the Office has an
      Electee, then the Electee holds the Office; otherwise, the
      Delegated Player continues to hold the Office.

      An election to fill an office must be held whenever:

      (b) the office is created without installing an electee; or

      (c) an election to fill that office fails, and no election for
          that office is in progress.

      As long as an election to fill an office is in progress, no
      other election to fill that office may be initiated.  An
      election is in progress from the time it is initiated until it
      is resolved.

      If a player required to initiate an election fails to do so as
      soon as possible, then any player may announce that the election
      has failed.  Provided that this assertion is indeed correct,
      then upon this announcement the election fails.

Rule 1665/2 (Power=1)
Abuse of Responsibility

      The Rules can give certain Officers latitude to make certain
      decisions and determinations based upon their judgement.  When
      these decisions and determinations have effect on the Game
      State, Players shall always have the ability to make Claims of
      Error alleging that these decisions and determinations were made
      outside the authority given to the Officer.  This Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which otherwise defines a final arbiter
      for such decisions and determinations.

      If such a Claim is denied by the Officer, the Player making the
      Claim is then permitted to make a Call for Judgement alleging
      that the Officer is guilty of Abuse of Responsibility, a Class 4
      Crime.  This is the only time such a CFJ is permitted.

      In Judging such a CFJ, to find the Officer guilty the Judge must
      establish that the Officer did one of the following:

        i) Went beyond all reasonable interpretations of the Rules.
       ii) That e disregarded explicit instructions the Rules gave in
           regard to eir decisions and determinations.
      iii) That e showed a pathological lack of judgement in such
           decisions and determinations.

      The accused Officer must be given the opportunity to explain eir
      actions.  And such Judgements shall be made in accord to the
      strictest possible standard of proof.

Rule 1664/29 (Power=2)
Rebellion

      A Call for Revolt is a notice submitted by a player (the
      Agitator) which alleges, roughly, that the current government is
      corrupt, oppressive and self-serving, that rather than watching
      over the people it is watching the people, that action must be
      taken, and furthermore asserts that we do not need a key,
      because we can break in.  The Call is valid only if:

      (a) the Agitator was rebellious when e submitted the Call;

      (b) no other Call has been made during the same week; and

      (c) no Revolt has been successful for the previous thirty days.

      As soon as possible after a valid Call for Revolt has been
      submitted, the Registrar shall perform the following events in
      order:

      (a) select a random integer from 1 to the number of players
          (plus 1 if a player bears Miscreant);

      (b) if the selected number is less than or equal to the number
          of rebellious players (plus 1 if a rebellious player bears
          Miscreant), then:

          (1) announce that the Revolt succeeds;

          (2) expunge the blots of each rebellious player;

          (3) grant the ephemeral patent title Rebel Hero to each
              rebellious player;

          (4) set the initiative of each abiding player to Goethe, and
              return all stock cards held by abiding players to the
              Deck;

          (5) retire each abiding electee from office; and

          (6) flip each rebellious player's orthodoxy to abiding;

          otherwise:

          (1) announce that the Call for Revolt has failed;

          (2) assess each rebellious player 2 blots; and

          (3) assess the Agitator an additional 2 blots.

      The effects of a Call for Revolt shall be based on the orthodoxy
      of players at the time the Call was submitted.

      The Registrar shall notify the Herald of all blots gained or
      expunged as a result of this rule, and is empowered to perform
      the actions this rule would require em to perform.

Rule 1988/0 (Power=2)
Bastille Day

      July 14 of each year shall be known as Bastille Day.  For a
      Revolt called on this day the normal procedure is modified, as
      follows:

         i) Each Rebellious Player shall count twice for the purpose
            of determining success if, during that Bastille Day, e
            publicly hums a few bars of 'La Marseillaise'.

            This includes the determination of the number of players,
            and the Miscreant adjustment, which may become 2 rather
            than 1.

        ii) On success, rather than having all eir Blots expunged,
            each Rebellious Player shall be left with 1 Blot each,
            even if e was previously Immaculate.

      This Rule takes precedence over the normal Revolt Procedure.

Rule 1840/4 (Power=2)
Political Status

      Orthodoxy is a stuck player switch with values abiding and
      rebellious.

      A player may flip eir orthodoxy, unless e has done so during the
      current month.

      At the beginning of each month, each Rebellious Player commits
      the Class 2 Infraction of Inciting to Riot (to be reported by
      the Registrar), unless all of the following are true at that
      time:

        i) The Registrar has not announced whether the last Call for
           Revolt succeeded or failed.
       ii) The Player was Rebellious at the time of the last Call for
           Revolt.
      iii) The Player has not changed from Abiding to Rebellious since
           the last Call for Revolt.

      in which case the Player is Hauled Into Kangaroo Court instead.

      When a Call for Revolt fails, each Player Hauled Into Kangaroo
      Court since the Call for Revolt commits the Infraction of
      Inciting to Riot, as defined above.

Rule 1975/7 (Power=1)
The Associate Director of Personnel

      The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is an office; its
      holder is recordkeepor for offices and the Speaker and is

Rule 1940/10 (Power=1)
Periodic Compensations

      The boon of Public Service exists for the purpose of awarding
      officers for serving.

      Paperwork is a stuck switch for offices with states low and
      high.  The Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) is the
      recordkeepor for paperwork.  For the purpose of this rule, the
      Speaker and the Distributor are considered offices.  The ADoP or
      the Speaker may flip the paperwork of an office with two
      supporters and without two objections.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the ADoP
      shall award 1 Public Service Boon for each office to the player
      (if any) who held that office for 16 or more days in the
      previous month; e shall award an additional Public Service boon
      to that player if the office is a high paperwork office.

      While a player is electee to an office, e may make one proposal
      distributable per month by publicly invoking that office's Civil
      Service Exemption, even if this would cause em to exceed eir
      per-player proposal limit.

Rule 1483/12 (Power=1)
Definition of Proposals

      A proposal is a document outlining changes to be made to Agora,
      including enacting, repealing, or amending rules, or making
      other explicit changes to the gamestate.

      A legislator submits a proposal by publishing it with a clear
      indication that it is intended to become a proposal.  As soon as
      possible afterward, the Promotor shall add this proposal to the
      Proposal Pool.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      modify its adoption index by announcement.  The default adoption
      index of a proposal is one.

      All players are legislators.

[CFJ 762: Anything contained in a Proposal is part of that Proposal,
 unless the Rules or Game Custom specifically says otherwise.]

Rule 1698/0 (Power=3)
The Proposal System Is Protected

      It must always be possible to adopt Proposals within a 4 week
      period. Any change to the game state which would result in
      this condition becoming false is cancelled and does not take
      place, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

Rule 105/1 (Power=3)
What Is a Rule Change?

      A Rule Change is any of the following:

      * The enactment of a new Rule;
      * The repeal of an existing Rule;
      * The amendment of the text of an existing Rule; or
      * Any change to a substantive property of a Rule other than
        its text.

      A "substantive property of a Rule" is any property of that
      Rule (other than its text) which determines in part or in full
      the ability of that Rule to govern by itself or in conjunction
      with other Rules.

[CFJ 708: An Amendment of a non-existing Rule is not a legal Rule
 Change.]

Rule 107/2 (Power=3)
Initiating Agoran Decisions

      An Agoran decision is initiated when a person authorized to
      initiate it publishes a valid notice which sets forth the intent
      to initiate the decision.  To be valid, this notice must contain
      the following information:

      (a) The matter to be decided (for example, "the election for
          Scorekeepor" or "the adoption of proposal 4781").

      (b) A description of the class of eligible voters sufficient to
          enable public agreement on which persons are eligible.  In
          particular, an explicit list of the eligible voters is
          always sufficient for this purpose.

      (c) The identity of the vote collector.

      (d) Any additional information required by the rules for this
          announcement.

      The publication of such a valid notice initiates the voting
      period for the decision.  By default, the voting period lasts
      for seven days.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would require a voting period for some decision to be shorter
      than seven days.

Rule 594/9 (Power=3)
Enactment of Rules

      A proposal can, as part of its effect, enact a rule, specifying
      its content and optionally specifying its power and title.  If
      the proposal does not specify the power, the rule shall have
      power equal to one.  If the proposal specifies the power, then
      the rule shall have power equal to the minimum of four, the
      power of the proposal, and the power specified by the proposal.
      If the title is not specified, the Rulekeepor may select any
      title e sees fit.

      When a rule is enacted, the Rulekeepor shall assign it a number,
      which must be greater than any number previously assigned, and
      shall assign it a revision number of zero.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      enacted.

[CFJ 778: It is legal for a Proposal to contain zero Rule Changes.]

Rule 2119/0 (Power=3)
Repeal of Rules

      A proposal can, as part of its effect, repeal a rule with power
      no greater than its own.  When a rule is repealed, it ceases to
      be a rule, and the Rulekeepor need no longer maintain a record
      of it.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      repealed.

Adoption Indices

      When a decision on whether to adopt a proposal or referendum is

      decision has begun, the adoption index of that decision can only
      be changed by the Speaker's veto.

      Depth is a stuck proposal switch with values undistributable and
      distributable.

      Before the Promotor distributes a proposal, its proposer may
      flip its depth by announcement as long as the number of eir
      distributable proposals which have been submitted but have not
      been distributed or retracted is less than the per-player
      proposal limit.

Rule 1770/17 (Power=1)
Distributing Proposals

      (a) The Promotor is permitted to distribute a distributable
          proposal in the Proposal Pool at any time.

      (b) During each week, the Promotor must distribute each proposal
          which was distributable at the beginning of the week and
          which remains distributable.
d1192 5
a1196 22
      (c) If there were no proposals in the Proposal Pool at the
          beginning of a week, then the Promotor must announce this
          fact at some time during that week.

      (d) The Promotor legally distributes a proposal by publishing it
          accompanied by an explicit indication that it is being
          distributed.  When a proposal is distributed, it is removed
          from the Proposal Pool.  The distribution of a proposal
          initiates the Agoran decision of whether to adopt the
          proposal, as described elsewhere.

      (e) The Promotor shall include with the distribution of each
          proposal the identity of its proposer, the proposal's
          coauthors, if any, its chamber, and its adoption index.
          However, the failure of the Promotor to include any of these
          with a proposal does not deprive the distribution of the
          proposal of any legal effect.

[In upholding the Judgement of CFJ 1089, the Board of Appeals held
 that in order for a Proposal to have been legally distributed, it is
 necessary (although perhaps not sufficient) that some text with
 demonstrably the same effects as the Proposal have been distributed.]

Rule 106/2 (Power=3)
Adopting Proposals

      Determining whether to adopt a proposal is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
      PRESENT, and by default, the eligible voters are the active
      players, the adoption index is the adoption index of the
      proposal, and the vote collector is the Assessor.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the proposal is adopted, and unless other rules prevent it
      from taking effect, its power is set to the minimum of four and
      its adoption index, and then it takes effect.  It does not
      otherwise take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule
      which would permit a proposal to take effect.

Rule 2034/2 (Power=3)
Vote Protection and Cutoff for Challenges

      Any proposal that, as all or part of its effect, would change
      the validity of one or more of a voter's ballots on an Agoran
      decision whose voting period has begun but which has not yet
      been resolved shall be wholly without effect, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.

      Once an Agoran decision has been resolved, no ballots on that
      decision may be validly submitted or retracted, and the outcome
      of the decision may not be changed in any way, any rule to the
      contrary notwithstanding.  Nothing in this rule shall be
      construed as preventing the correction of errors in reporting
      the resolution of an Agoran decision.

      If the success of the resolution of an Agoran decision is not
      challenged within one week from the time the vote collector
      announces it, then the announced result is the true result of
      that decision, even if it would otherwise be in error.

A Proposal's Chamber

      Chamber is a stuck proposal switch with values ordinary and
      democratic.

      An ordinary proposal with an adoption index of two or greater is
      stalled.  Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, a stalled
      proposal is undistributable, and if a proposal is distributed
      that was stalled at the time of distribution, its chamber shall
      immediately and automatically be set to democratic.  If the
      Promotor knowingly distributes a stalled proposal, e commits the
      class 4 crime of Improper Debate.

      Any player can flip the Chamber of a stalled proposal to
      democratic without objection.  The Speaker can flip the Chamber
      of a stalled proposal to democratic with support.

      The vote collector for a particular Agoran decision is
      authorized to resolve that decision, and does so by publishing a

      indicating the option selected by Agora.  To be valid, this

          valid ballots on the various options.

      Each Agoran decision shall have at most one vote collector at a

          (2) if the strength of FOR is zero, then the voting index is

              the strength of AGAINST.

          If the voting index exceeds one and meets or exceeds the
          adoption index of the decision, and if further quorum was
          achieved, then the option selected by Agora is ADOPTED.
          Otherwise, the option selected by Agora is REJECTED.

      (d) If the decision is an election, then as long as quorum is
          achieved, the vote collector has the privilege to choose any
          option the strength of which meets or exceeds that of any
          other option to be the option selected by Agora.

Modification of Rules
d1595 4
a1598 16
      A proposal can generally, as part of its effect, modify the
      power, title, or text of a rule with power no greater than its
      own.  However, a proposal cannot cause a rule to have power
      greater than its own.  Any ambiguity in a modification specified
      by a proposal causes that modification to be void and without
      effect.  A variation in whitespace or capitalization in the
      quotation of an existing rule does not constitute ambiguity for
      the purposes of this rule, but any other variation does.

      When a rule is modified, the Rulekeepor shall generally record
      an increase by one in its revision number.  If a single proposal
      modifies a regulation several times, the Rulekeepor shall only
      record a single increase of its revision number.

      This rule provides the only mechanism by which rules can be
      modified.

Rule 1434/14 (Power=2)
Default Procedure for Referendum Voting

      Determining whether to adopt a referendum is an Agoran decision.
      For this decision, the available options are FOR, AGAINST, and
      PRESENT, and the eligible voters are the players.

      If the option selected by Agora on this decision is ADOPTED,
      then the referendum is adopted, and unless other rules prevent
      it from taking effect, it takes effect.  It does not otherwise
      take effect.  This rule takes precedence over any rule which
      would permit a referendum to take effect.

      (b) E shall initiate an election, which is an Agoran decision.
          For this decision:

          (1) The available options are the nominees.  Eir

Rule 1957/3 (Power=1)
Budgets

      A budget is a document maintained by an office which determines
      the values of various properties the office is empowered to
      determine.  An office has a budget only if the Rules explicitly
      indicate that the office has a budget.  Each budget shall be
      part of the corresponding office's Monthly Report.  As soon as
      possible after a budget changes, the holder of the corresponding
      office (the maintainer) shall publish it.

      As soon as possible after a budget is discovered to be invalid,
      its maintainer shall create a valid budget as close as possible
      to the most recent valid version of the budget.  The new budget
      shall be effective when the maintainer publishes it.

      While holding an office as electee, an officer may Without
      Objection amend the budget to adhere to a proto-budget which e
      must publish at the time e announces eir intent to amend.  The
      Rules regarding a particular budget may specify a different
      procedure for its amendment.

Rule 1958/2 (Power=1)
Nominating with Budgets

      (a) If an office has a budget, then a nomination in an election
          for that office is not valid unless a valid proto-budget is
          associated with it.

      (b) A proto-budget submitted by a nominee during the nominating
          period is associated with that nominee's nomination. A
          proto-budget is valid if it would be valid as a budget.

      (c) If a nominee for an Office fails to submit a valid
          proto-budget during the nominating period, then by default
          eir nomination is associated with a proto-budget identical
          to the current budget for that Office.  If the current
          budget is not valid, tough cookies.

      (d) As soon as possible after the end of the nominating period,
          the vote collector shall announce each candidate's last
          valid proto-budget.

      (e) When the election ends, the winner's last valid proto-budget
          becomes the budget of that office, and the winner shall
          announce it as soon as possible.  If the election ends
          without a winner, then the existing budget remains in
          effect.

Rule 514/2 (Power=1)
Keep the Registrar Informed of Your Address

      Each Player may list or unlist an e-mail address by informing
      the Registrar that e is doing so.  When a Player registers, the
      address used to send eir registration becomes listed.

      A listing is only valid if the Player sends a public message
      from the listed address within one week of the listing.  (This
      message may be the listing itself.)  An unlisting is only valid
      if the Player keeps at least one address listed.

      If a Player fails to notify the Registrar of a change of
      address, then the Registrar is not responsible for any e-mail
      that fails to reach that Player.

Rule 1681/7 (Power=1)
The Logical Rulesets

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each rule is assigned to a
      category, and the rules are grouped according to their category.
      Within a category, the ordering of rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.

      A new Rule is assigned to a category as the Rulekeepor sees fit.
      The Rulekeepor may, without 2 objections, move Rules between
      categories, change the name of a category, and add or remove
      empty categories.

      The listing of each rule in the SLR must include the rule's
      number, revision number, power, title, and text, and must also
      include any annotations to the rule required by order.

      The Rulekeepor is strongly encouraged not to include any
      additional information in the SLR, except that which increases
      the readability of the SLR.

      There is a format of the ruleset known as the Full Logical
      Ruleset (FLR).  In this format, rules are assigned to the same
      category and presented in the same order as in the SLR.  The FLR
      must contain all the information required to be in the SLR, as
      well as a brief description of each category and any historical
      annotations which the Rulekeepor is required to record.

      The Rulekeepor is also free to include any other information
      which e feels may be helpful in the use of the ruleset in the
      FLR.

Rule 1485/8 (Power=1)
Titles for Rules

      Each Rule has a Title, which is a single line of text
      containing not more than 60 characters.  The Title must be
      listed by the Rulekeepor along with the Rule.  However, the
      Title is not part of the Rule itself and has no effect on the
      meaning or application of the Rule, being merely a convenience
      for the Players.

      A Rule Change that Creates a new Rule may specify a Title for
      the new Rule.  If it does not, the Rulekeepor shall choose the
      new Rule's Title.

      The Rulekeepor is authorized to change the Title of a Rule
      Without Objection.

Rule 1430/6 (Power=1)
Mandatory Rule Annotations

      Whenever a rule is changed in any way, the Rulekeeper shall
      record a historical annotation to the rule indicating:

      (a) the type of change;
      (b) if the rule was changed due to a proposal, a reference to
          that proposal, its proposer, and any coauthors explicitly
          named in that proposal;
      (c) if the rule was changed by some other mechanism, the
          mechanism which specified the change; and
      (d) the date on which the change took effect.

      Other rules may require additional information to appear in an
      annotation for certain types of Rule Change.

      Annotations to a rule are not part of the rule, and annotating a
      rule is not a rule change.  The Rulekeepor shall indicate all
      annotations in such a way that they are readily distinguished
      from the text of the rule.

      When a rule is repealed, all annotations attached to it are
      discarded, and need not appear in the published Ruleset.

Rule 681/13 (Power=1)
Conclaves

      Agora exits from Conclave whenever a player becomes a pope.

      Agora enters into Conclave whenever there is no pope and one of
      the following triggering events occurs:

      (a) the Speaker resigns the Speakership, becomes inactive, or
          otherwise ceases to be Speaker without another player being
          installed as Speaker;

      (b) the success of a Call for Revolt is announced, and the
          Speaker was abiding at the time of the Call for Revolt, in
          which case the rebellious cardinals are the only qualified
          cardinals;

      (c) two or more cardinals simultaneously win the game, in which
          case these cardinals are the only qualified cardinals;

      (d) no pope has become Speaker for the past six months; or

      (e) a pope ceases to be pope without becoming Speaker.

      As soon as possible after Agora enters into conclave, the
      Associate Director of Personnel must announce the fact and
      publish a list of qualified cardinals.  All cardinals are
      considered qualified unless specifically restricted by the
      particular triggering event.  If Agora is already in conclave
      when a triggering event occurs, Agora remains in conclave, but
      the qualification of each cardinal is modified to reflect the
      more recent event.

      While Agora is in conclave, any player may make a qualified
      Cardinal into a pope, with Agoran consent.  If the legality of
      this action is not challenged within seven days of it being
      attempted, then it shall be allowed to stand, even if is
      subsequently found to be illegal.

      So there's always hope
      that you can be pope.

Rule 402/15 (Power=1)
Church and State

      A cardinal is an active, ready player who is not the current
      Speaker.

      For seven days after a cardinal wins the game with no other
      players simultaneously winning, that cardinal may announce that
      e becomes a pope.  Upon this announcement, that player becomes a
      pope, so please treat em right good forever.

      When a cardinal becomes a pope, any previous pope immediately
      ceases being a pope.  Whenever a pope is not a cardinal, e
      immediately ceases being a pope.

      Any Player who is not a pope may install the pope as Speaker, by
      announcement.  Upon this announcement, if the announced player
      is still a pope, then the current Speaker ceases to be Speaker,
      and the pope is installed as the new Speaker and ceases to be a
      pope.

      This installation cannot be performed if there are unresolved
      challenges regarding the pope-ness of the player.  If the
      legality of an installation is not challenged within seven days
      of it being attempted, then it shall be allowed to stand, even
      if is subsequently found to be illegal.

      There exists a type of Contract known as Agoran Contract. An
      Agoran Contract is a Contract between any two entities. An
      Agoran Contract may only be created or amended by a Proposal and
      becomes effective when the Proposal takes effect. Unless
      otherwise specified in the Rules or Regulations, All Players are
      automatically Members of Agoran Contracts and no Player may
      leave an Agoran Contract.

Applications

      An Application is any document which has been clearly labeled as
      an Application and which has been submitted as an Application by
      some person.  That person is known as the Application's Sponsor.

      The Sponsor of an Application may attach the signatures of other
      persons, or signatories, to the Application at the time e
      submits it.  The Sponsor may not attach any signature to an
      Application without first having obtained the explicit consent
      of the signatory.  A signatory may revoke eir consent, once
      granted, by informing the Sponsor.

      An Application is submitted by sending it to a Player designed
      by the Rules to receive Applications of that particular type,
      bearing a clear indication that the document in question is
      intended to be an Application and that it is being submitted by
      the Sponsor as an Application.  If the Rules do not otherwise
      designate a Player to receive a particular type of Application,
      the Speaker shall do so.  The effect of submitting an valid
      Application is determined by the Rules pertaining to
      Applications of that particular type.

      A person who submits an Application with signatures attached
      belonging to any person who has not consented to having eir
      signature attached to that Application commits the Class 4 Crime
      of Application Fraud.  An Application submitted with attached
      signatures belonging to a person who did not consent to such
      attachment is invalid.

      Signatures are presumed to have been attached with the consent
      of the signatory.  This presumption shall be rebutted only by a
      declaration from the alleged signatory, made within 60 days of
      the submission of the Application, stating that the signatory
      did not consent or that e consented and then subsequently
      revoked eir consent.  The Sponsor bears the burden of proof to
      show that such a declaration, once made, is false.

      It shall be a defense to the Crime of Application Fraud that the
      Sponsor did not receive a signatory's notice of revocation.

Agreements between Players

      Players may make agreements among themselves with the intention
      that such agreements will be binding under the rules.  If such
      an agreement is subsequently broken, any player party to that
      agreement may then call a CFJ alleging that the agreement has
      been broken.  If the judge of such a CFJ finds that the
      agreement was entered into with the intention that the agreement
      be binding under the rules, and that the agreement has in fact
      been broken, then e may order the breaching party to perform
      according to the agreement, or perform substitute acts that
      would fairly serve the interests of the agreement; e may further
      order the other parties of the agreement to perform such acts as
      may be necessary to preserve fairness and justice.

      Nothing in this rule shall be construed so as to impair the
      enforcement of an agreement which requires a Player to violate
      another agreement.

      If a CFJ alleging that an agreement has been broken is called by
      anyone who is not party to that agreement, then it lacks
      standing and shall be dismissed.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions
d3767 2

      There shall exist a type of Application called an Application to
      Submit an Opinion.  Such an Application, if effective, has the
      effect of annotating a Judgement in a given Call for Judgement.
      In order for such an Application to have effect upon submission,
      it must satisfy the following requirements:

      * It must clearly indicate to which CFJ it applies.
      * It must be labeled as either a Concurring Opinion or
        a Dissenting Opinion.
      * It must indicate whether the Judgement to which it applies is
        that of the Judge or that of the Appeals Court.
      * It must be accompanied by reasons and arguments, which
        may include, but are not necessarily limited to, citations
        of deciding Rules, past Judgements, and Game Custom.
      * It must bear the Signatures of at least two Players.
      * It must be submitted no earlier than the submission of the
        Judgement to which it applies, and no later than one week
        after the publication by the Clerk of the Courts of that
        Judgement.

      An Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted by submitting
      it to the Clerk of the Courts.  Such an Application, having been
      submitted and having met all the requirements for effectiveness,
      is also called an Opinion.  It is also referred to as a
      Concurring Opinion or a Dissenting Opinion, as indicated in the
      Opinion.

      Once an Application to Submit an Opinion is submitted and takes
      effect, the Clerk of the Courts must distribute the Opinion to
      all Players as soon as possible.  Furthermore, the Opinion must
      be appended to the Legal Judgement.

The Board of Appeals

      When an Appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected to reach a decision about the subject of the Appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three Appellate Judges.  Any
      Judge assigned according to this Rule is an Appellate Judge.

      A Board of Appeals is selected when the Clerk of the Courts
      correctly announces the identity of all Appellate Judges,
      determined as follows:

        a) The Speaker is selected, if eligible.
        b) The Clerk of the Courts is selected, if eligible.
        c) The Justiciar is selected, if eligible.
        d) Any remaining positions are filled by selection by
           the Clerk of the Courts from all remaining eligible
           Players.

      A Player is ineligible for selection if any of the following is
      true:

        i) E has already been selected for that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed from that Board.
      iii) E has been Trial Judge of the subject of the Appeal.
       iv) E is ineligible to Judge the CFJ at the time of selection.
        v) E is not Active.

      An Appellate Judge may appoint another eligible Player as eir
      replacement by informing the Clerk of the Courts, provided the
      Player consents.

      As soon as possible after an Appellate Judge is recused, the
      Clerk of the Courts shall randomly select an eligible Player to
      replace em.

      The last Appellate Judge selected is the Lead Judge for that
      Board.  If the Lead Judge is replaced, then the replacement
      becomes Lead Judge.

Notices of Infraction

      If an entity (hereafter the Jaywalker) commits an Infraction,
      then any Player authorized by the Rules to report the commission
      of that Infraction (hereafter the Traffic Cop) may publish a
      Notice of Infraction.  This Notice shall explicitly specify the
      following:

        a) The Infraction that has been committed.
        b) The identity of the Jaywalker.
        c) The Rule(s) defining that action or inaction as an
           Infraction.
        d) The action or inaction by which the Jaywalker committed the
           Infraction.
        e) All and only those Ticketing Orders necessary and
           sufficient to impose the penalty for that Infraction.  The
           Orders are executed and take effect upon publication.

      When a Player publishes a Claim of Error alleging that the
      Jaywalker did not commit the Infraction, e may (in the same
      message as the COE) stay one or more of the Ticketing Orders.
      If the COE is denied, then the Traffic Cop shall vacate the
      Order to Stay as soon as possible. If the COE is admitted, then
      the Traffic Cop shall vacate all the stayed Ticketing Orders as
      soon as possible.

      Players are encouraged to CFJ on the commission of Infractions
      only when a question of interpretation, rather than of fact,
      arises.

[CFJ 1391: Only one valid Notice of Infraction may be announced for a
 single given commission of an Infraction.]

Rule 1505/12 (Power=1)
Standard Classes of Crimes and Infractions

      A Class N Infraction (where N is replaced with a number) is an
      Infraction for which the penalty is N Blots minus the number of
      Shares owned by the penalized entity at the time of the
      Infraction, with a minimum of 1. Such a penalty is assessed upon
      the execution of a Ticketing Order that Orders the Herald to
      record the penalty.

      A Class N Crime (where N is replaced with a number) is a Crime
      for which the penalty is N Blots.  Such a penalty is assessed
      upon the execution of a Sentencing Order that Orders the Herald
      to record the penalty.

      If such a Sentencing or Ticketing Order is vacated after the
      Herald has already recorded the penalty, then an equal number of
      Blots are expunged from the penalized entity.  (If the entity
      has less Blots than the amount of the penalty, then all eir
      Blots are expunged.)

Rule 2017/1 (Power=1)
Blots

      The stain of an entity is an index measuring how unclean that
      entity is.  An entity is immaculate, or squeaky clean, if its
      stain is zero.

      If an entity gains, is assessed, or is penalised a given number
      of Blots, then as soon as possible after the Herald is informed,
      either by emself or by others, of the change, e shall record an
      increase in that entity's stain of that amount (or half that
      amount if the entity is an unready player at the time of the
      change).

      If some number of an entity's Blots are expunged, then as soon
      as possible after the Herald is informed of the change, e shall
      record a decrease of that amount in the entity's stain.  If this
      would result in a negative stain, then it instead results in a
      stain of zero.

Rule 1714/9 (Power=1)
Lawlessness

      A player is lawless while e has more than 20 blots.

      A notice of lawlessness is an allegation by one player (the
      Inquisitor) that a specified player (the Scofflaw) is lawless.
      As soon as possible after the publication of such a notice, the
      Herald shall publicly confirm or deny the allegation.

      If the Herald confirms the allegation, then the following events
      occur in order:

      (a) if the Scofflaw is the Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker;

      (b) the Scofflaw is removed from any offices e holds; and

      (c) the Scofflaw is deregistered.

      If the Herald denies the allegation, then the Inquisitor should
      be punished.  You know what to do.

      If a player is deregistered according to the provisions of this
      rule, e may not register again until a month has passed from eir
      deregistration.

      This rule takes precedence over any Rule that would prohibit a
      lawless player from being deregistered.

[CFJ 1059: Rule 1714 should be interpreted such that an allegation of
 Lawlessness sent to the PF must contain an explicit declaration that
 a particular Player is Lawless.]

Rule 2107/1 (Power=1)
Contracts
d4893 27
a4919 30
      There exists a type of agreement known as a Contract.  A
      Contract is an Entity.  The content of a Contract is called its
      Regulations.  The first Player to announce the creation of a
      Contract is its Executor and is known as the Notary of that
      Contract.  Any other Player may decide to become part of a
      Contract by notifying that Contract's Notary.  Players party to
      a Contract, including the Notary, are the Members of this
      Contract.  A Member may leave a Contract at any time by
      notifying the Notary.

      A Contract may contain any number of Regulations.  Regulations
      have the power to constrain the actions of Players in the same
      manner as the Rules.  However, Regulations have power over only
      those Players that are Members of that Contract.  All Members
      are required to abide by the Regulations, unless doing so would
      violate the Rules.  Violation of this requirement is the Class 1
      Crime of Insubordination.  A Contract may include in its
      Regulations ways for Players to leave the Contract.

      Rules to the contrary notwithstanding, no Player shall ever
      involuntarily become a Member of a Contract.

      If the Notary of a Contract is deregistered, all Members of this
      Contract cease to be Members of this Contract and the Contract
      ceases to exist.

      Only Members of a Contract may CFJ that a Member has violated
      that Contract.  All Members of a Contract are automatically
      ineligible to Judge a CFJ that a Member has violated that
      Contract.

      The Notary of a given Contract must provide a copy of its

      possible after the request is made.  The Notary of a Contract
      must also provide an updated copy of the Regulations to all
      Members as soon as possible after the Regulations change for any
      reason.  Regulations can not be changed except in accordance
      with the Rules.  Regulations are permitted to define their own
      mechanisms for changing their own content, and any change to
      Regulations adopted in accordance with their own mechanisms is
      legal.

      (a) An Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
          Rules to act on behalf of that entity, who is called the
          Executee. There may be more than one such Player. An
          Executor of an Executee may perform on behalf of the
          Executee all such actions as the Rules permit the Executee
          to perform.

      (b) A Limited Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered
          by the Rules to perform on behalf of that entity a subset of
          the actions which the Rules permit the entity to perform. A
          Limited Executor is permitted to perform on behalf of an
          Executee only such actions as are explicitly permitted by
          the Rules.

      (c) A Player is always eir own Executor. Other entities have
          Executors (or Limited Executors) only as and when the Rules
          provide.

      (d) A Player acting on behalf of an entity other than emself
          must clearly indicate on whose behalf e is acting. A Player
          who does not clearly indicate that e is acting on behalf of
          some entity other than emself is presumed to be acting on
          eir own behalf.

      (e) Only persons may perform actions. Non-persons perform
          actions only via the agency of persons, as specified by the
          Rules.

Agoran Epochs
d571 4

      Days, weeks, months, quarters, and years are epochs.  The
      corresponding Agoran epochs are Agoran days, Agoran weeks,
      Agoran months, Agoran quarters, and Agoran years, respectively.

      Agoran days begin at midnight GMT.  Agoran weeks begin at
      midnight GMT on Monday.  Agoran months begin at midnight GMT on
      the first day of each Gregorian month.  Agoran quarters begin
      when the Agoran months of January, April, July, and October
      begin.  Agoran years begin when the Agoran month of January
      begins.  An Agoran epoch lasts until the next Agoran epoch of
      the same type begins.

      Except in this Rule, when the Rules refer to an epoch as an
      independent entity (e.g. "each month"), they shall be
      interpreted as referring to the corresponding Agoran epoch.
      However, when the Rules refer to an epoch as a relative duration
      (e.g. "one month after", "within one month", "for one month"),
      they shall be interpreted as referring to the ordinary-language
      meaning of that duration.

      Automatic events that happen daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly,
      or yearly happen at the beginning of the corresponding Agoran
      epoch.  Any activity that must be performed daily, weekly,
      monthly, quarterly, or yearly must be performed at least once
      during each corresponding Agoran epoch.

Rule 1769/2 (Power=2)
Holidays

      A Holiday is a period of time, not to exceed 17 days in length,
      designated as such by the Rules.  If one Holiday begins within
      72 hours of the end of another Holiday, the two Holidays and the
      time between them are taken as a single Holiday, unless this
      would cause the combined Holiday to exceed 17 days in length, in
      which case the first Holiday is extended to 17 days and the
      second Holiday does not occur.

      During a Holiday, no Proposal may be distributed by the
      Promotor, nor may any Call for Judgement, Judgement, notice of
      Appeal, Decision of Appeals Boards, or Opinion be published by
      the Clerk of the Courts; however, if any of the above do take
      place during the Holiday in violation of this Rule, this Rule
      does not deprive them of their usual effects.

      If some Rule requires that an action be done prior to a given
      time, and that given time falls during a Holiday, or within the
      72-hour period immediately following that Holiday, then that
      action need not be done until 72 hours after that Holiday ends.

      If some Rule bases the time of a future event upon the time of
      another event, or requires that a Player perform some action
      within some time of another event, and that other event occurs
      during a Holiday, the time at which the Holiday ends shall be
      used instead for the purpose of determining the time of the
      future event or of the time by which the Player must perform the
      specified action.

      This Rule takes precedence over all Rules pertaining to the
      timing of events, and over all Rules which require Players to
      perform events before a specified time.

      There exists a Boon known as Shiny New Toy, and an Albatross

      with a Stain of at least one Blot are known as Naughty, and
      Players with a Stain of less than one Blot are known as Nice.

Rule 1482/1 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Unequal Power

      In a conflict between Rules with different Power, the Rule with
      the higher Power takes precedence over the Rule with the lower
      Power.

CFJ 1103 (Judged TRUE, Aug. 21 1998): "In the case of conflict
 between Rules of unequal Power, the higher Powered Rule cannot defer
 to the lower Powered Rule, unless the higher Powered Rule takes
 precedence over Rule 1482."

[CFJ 858: If a low-Power (low-MI at the time of Judgement of CFJ 858)
 Rule attempts to define a term used in a Rule of higher Power to
 mean something other than its ordinary English meaning, that
 may or may not constitute a conflict; whether it does must be
 decided on a case-by-case basis.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1030/4 (Power=3)
Precedence between Rules with Equal Power

      If two or more Rules with the same Power conflict with one
      another, then the Rule with the lower Number takes precedence.

      If at least one of the Rules in conflict explicitly says of
      itself that it defers to another Rule (or type of Rule) or
      takes precedence over another Rule (or type of Rule), then such
      provisions shall supercede the numerical method for determining
      precedence.

      If all of the Rules in conflict explicitly say that their
      precedence relations are determined by some other Rule for
      determining precedence relations, then the determinations of
      the precedence determining Rule shall supercede the numerical
      method for determining precedence.

      If two or more Rules claim to take precedence over one another
      or defer to one another, then the numerical method again
      governs.

CFJ 1104 (Judged TRUE, Sep. 9 1998): "The presence in a Rule of
 deference clause, claiming that the Rule defers to another Rule, does
 not prevent a conflict with the other Rule arising, but shows only
 how the Rule says that conflict is to be resolved when it does
 arise."

[CFJs 1114 and 1115 (both Judged Feb. 5 1999): This Rule is to be
 applied to resolve Rule conflicts on a case-by-case basis; just
 because a Rule is inapplicable in one situation due to conflict
 with a Rule of higher precedence does not mean that the Rule is
 nullified in all cases.]

Rule 1513/4 (Power=1)
Authority of Non-Rule Entities

      The Rules may grant to certain entities the power to require
      Players to perform (or refrain from performing) actions.  Such
      Entities shall have whatever power is granted to them by the
      Rules.  In the event that the requirements of such an Entity
      conflicts with the Rules, the Rules shall always take
      precedence.

      If two or more such Entities conflict with one another, then the
      relative precedence of the respective Rules which grant coercive
      Power to the Entities in conflict shall determine which
      requirements take precedence.  If two or more Entities
      authorized by the same Rule conflict, then the Entity mentioned
      first in that Rule takes precedence over the others.

      No entity (including any body of text) may require a Player to
      perform or refrain from performing any action unless that
      Player has previously been provided with the information of
      which actions may be required of or prohibited em by that
      entity.

Rule 2036/3 (Power=1)
The Silent Treatment

      If a player (hereafter the Silent One) has been inactive
      continuously for three months, then any player may publish a
      Notice of Abandonment, identifying the silent one and alleging
      that e has abandoned the game.

      The publication of a Notice of Abandonment commences the Silent
      Treatment for the silent one.  If at any time during the silent
      treatment the silent one is not, or ceases to be, inactive, then
      the treatment is terminated, and the Registrar is relieved of
      all powers and responsibilities regarding it.

      As soon as possible after the commencement of the silent
      treatment, the Registrar shall publish in all designated Public
      Fora, and send to each listed e-mail address of the silent one,
      a Notice of Intent to Deregister, announcing the Registrar's
      intent to deregister the silent one after one month has passed.

      If the silent treatement has not terminated a month after the
      publication of the Notice of Intent to Deregister, then the
      Registrar shall, as soon as possible, publish in all designated
      Public Fora, and send to each listed e-mail address of the
      silent one, a Notice of Deregistration identifying the silent
      one.  A Notice of Deregistration is valid if and only if it is
      published by the Registrar, following the procedures described
      in this Rule.

      Upon publication of a valid Notice of Deregistration, the
      following events occur in order:

      (1) if the silent one is the Speaker, e ceases to be Speaker;

      (2) the silent one is deregistered;

      (3) the silent treatment for that player concludes.

      to be deregistered and instructing the Registrar to note the
      method of deregistration for that Player in subsequent Registrar
      Reports, as long as the Player remains deregistered.

      The Player is deregistered as of the posting of the Writ, and

Rule 1585/2 (Power=2)
Official Duties upon Officer Change

      Whenever the holder of an Office changes, any duties which the
      Rules had imposed upon the prior holder of that Office as a
      consequence of holding that Office which have not been fulfilled
      must instead be fulfilled by the new holder of that Office, as
      soon as possible after the change of Officer occurs.

      The former holder of the Office is absolved of performing all
      such duties, any Rule to the contrary notwithstanding.

CFJ 1061 (Judged TRUE, Nov. 2 1997): "Rule 1585 should be interpreted
 such that a Player who is newly installed into an Office does not
 commit the Infraction of Failure to Report (insofar as that Office is
 subject to such duties) if e posts the required Report within a week
 of eir being installed into Office."

      of that Office is required to maintain, are made available to

      Supporter".

      A player may publicly announce eir intent to perform an
      unambiguously described dependent action.  A player may perform
      a previously unambiguously described dependent action if and
      only if:

      (a)  no more than fourteen days have passed since the
           announcement of intent to perform the action;

      (b)  if the action to be performed is an Action Without N
           Objections, at least four days have passed since the
           announcement made under (a) of this rule;

      (c)  either the player who attempts to perform the action is the
           player who made the announcement under (a) of this rule, or

           (1)  the player who made the announcement under (a) of this
                rule did so by a privilege or duty granted em by
                virtue of holding a rules-defined position; and

           (2)  the player who attempts to perform the action is the
                holder of that position when e attempts to perform the
                action;

      (d)  the rules explicitly authorise the player to perform the
           action dependently;

      (e)  during the time between the announcement made under (a) of
           this rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  if the action is to be performed Without N Objections,
                fewer than N players have publicly posted objections
                to the performance of the action; or

           (2)  if the action is to be performed With N Supporters, at
                least N players other than the player who made the
                announcement under (a) of this rule have publicly
                posted support for the performance of the action;

      (f)  the announcement made under (a) of this rule specifies
           whether the action is to be performed Without N Objections
           or With N Supporters, unless the rules either do not permit
           the action to be performed Without N Objections or do not
           permit the action to be performed With N Supporters; and

Deckmastor's Budget

      The Deckmastor shall have a budget containing values for each of
      the following:

      (a) the Maximum Hand Size and the Minimum Hand Size, each of
          which is a positive integer between 2 and 10, with the
          Minimum being less than the Maximum. In the absence of a
          budget, the Maximum Hand Size shall be 5 and the Minimum
          Hand Size shall be 2.

      (b) the Maximum Deck Size, which shall be no less than the
          number of players in the game times the maximum hand size.

      (c) the Maximum Deck Diversity, which shall be no less than
          twice the number of players in the game.

      If the Budget does not specify values for (a-c) above, or
      specifies a value violating these limits, the value shall be the
      smallest value that does not violate these limits.

      The Deckmastor's Budget shall also contain a Quota, which is a
      non-negative integer, for each defined class of Card.  If the
      quota for a particular class of card is not specified in the
      Budget, that card shall have a quota of 0.

Rule 2113/0 (Power=1)
Card Constraints

      The following maxima exist for card frequencies:
          (a) For a card with a unique frequency, one.
          (b) For card with a rare frequency, the number of active
              players.

      If the current quota for a card class exceeds the maximum for
      its defined frequency, then any Player may, with 2 support,
      amend the Deckmastor's budget to set the card's quota to its
      maximum.  When a card's frequency is defined or changed, and the
      mechanism changing it does not specify a new quota, its quota is
      set to the maximum for that frequency.

      If at any time the sum of all quotas for all cards is greater
      than the Maximum Deck Size, the Deckmastor may, with 2 support,
      amend the budget by reducing quotas so that the resulting sum is
      equal to this maximum.

      If at any time the number of card classes with positive quotas
      is greater than the Maximum Deck Diversity, the Deckmastor may,
      with 2 support, amend the budget by setting quotas to 0 so that
      the resulting number of card classes with positive quotas is
      equal to this maximum.

Rule 2114/2 (Power=1)
Card Definitions

      A document is a cardbook if so designated by the rules.  The
      Deckmastor is the recordkeepor of cardbooks; eir monthly report
      shall include each cardbook.  As soon as possible after a
      cardbook changes, the Deckmastor shall publish that cardbook.  A
      cardbook may only be changed as explicitly permitted by the
      rules.

      The Deckmastor may change non-substantial properties of any
      cardbook, specifically layout, whitespace, and the order of
      definitions, as e sees fit.

      A cardbook can define a class of cards by specifying its
      Caption, Frequency, zero or one Exploits, and optionally its
      Elements, and can define an Element or Scoring Instruction by
      specifying its name and description.  Neither classes of cards
      Elements, nor Scoring Instructions may be otherwise defined.

      (a) The Caption is a string of text, unique to a particular
          class of cards.

      (b) The Frequency of a card is exactly one of the values Unique,
          Rare, or Common, defaulting to Unique if unspecified or
          incorrectly specified.

      (c) A card with a particular Element behaves according to the
          description of that Element.

      (d) An Exploit of a card may contain one or more Indications,
          Impositions, and Feats.

          (1) An Indication is a requirement for the gambler playing
              the card to select some entity or value.

          (2) An Imposition is a requirement the gambler may impose
              upon another gambler by playing the card.

          (3) A Feat is an action the gambler may perform by playing
              the card.

          (4) A Fuse is an Imposition or Feat that is not imposed or
              performed immediately, but rather when a stated
              condition occurs.

      A reference to "you" or "your" in any text on a card refers to
      the gambler holding the card unless it is on the table, and then
      refers to the gambler who played the card.

      The cards of a given class are fungible.  Each individual
      instance of a card shall be considered to be a copy of that
      class of card.

      If there are conflicts between a card or element definition in a
      cardbook and the rules, then the conflict shall be resolved as
      if the definition were contained in the text of the rule that
      defines the particular cardbook.  This rule takes precedence
      over any rule that would require a different method of resolving
      such conflicts.

      This rule takes precedence over any rule describing the
      definition or interpretation of card classes and card elements.

Card Actions

      (a) A nonperson entity is a site if so designated by the rules

      (b) A gambler is a player or a site.  All gamblers may hold
          cards.  If a card is held by a nongambler, the Deckmastor
          shall transfer that card to the Deck as soon as possible.

          A gambler's hand is the collection of cards held by that
          gambler.  A gambler's hand size is the size of this
          collection.

      (c) When a card must be created or destroyed, the Deckmastor
          shall be empowered to create or destroy that card, as
          appropriate, and must do so as soon as possible.  The
          Deckmastor creates or destroys a card by announcement,
          specifying as appropriate its holder or its former holder.
          Cards can be neither created nor destroyed otherwise.

          Whenever the quota for a class of cards exceeds the number
          of existing copies of that card, a copy of that card must be
          created.  The copy must be created in the deck's hand unless
          otherwise specified.

          Whenever the number of existing copies of a card exceeds the
          quota for its class, if the deck holds a copy of that card,
          a copy held by the deck must be destroyed, and if the deck
          does not, then a random copy of the card must be destroyed.

      (d) If a card would be transferred to the deck or the table, and
          the transfer is not performed automatically, as part of the
          Deckmastor's duties, or as the result of a card play, it is
          discarded instead.

          When a card or chip is otherwise transferred from one
          gambler to another, the former gambler shall cease to hold
          it and the latter gambler shall simultaneously come to hold
          it.

          Discarding a card is synonymous with transferring it to the
          discard pile.  Dealing a card to a gambler is synonymous
          with selecting a random card from the deck and transferring
          it from the deck to that gambler.

          A gambler may transfer a card e holds to another gambler by
          announcement, specifying the card to transfer and, if not
          discarding it, the gambler to receive the card.

          If the Deckmastor errs, in good faith, in selecting a
          particular card to deal, and that error does not greatly
          change the probability of selecting that card, that deal
          shall be allowed to stand.

          As soon as possible after a player correctly announces that
          there are no cards in the deck, then the Deckmastor shall
          reshuffle the deck.  Whenever the deck is reshuffled, all
          cards in the discard pile are automatically transferred to
          the deck.

Rule 2106/1 (Power=1)
Playing Cards

      A gambler plays a card with an Exploit by announcement,
      specifying the card to be played, indicating any entities or
      values mentioned in an Indication of the card's Exploit, and
      noting any fees required to play the card.  A card without an
      Exploit cannot be played.

      When a gambler plays a card, the following events automatically
      occur in order:

      (a) The card is transferred to the table.

      (b) One at a time in the order listed on the card, the gambler
          places any Impositions listed in the Exploit on the
          appropriate gamblers and performs each Feat listed in the
          Exploit.

      (c) If the card is still on the table, it is discarded.

      If the card has any Fuses, then the first time the stated
      condition for a Fuse occurs, the gambler places the Imposition
      or performs the Feat associated with that Fuse as appropriate.

      The Elements or Exploit of a card may modify any of the above
      events.

Rule 2075/9 (Power=1)
Winning Hands

      The Scoring Instructions contained in cardbooks, interpreted
      collectively, may define a nonsite gambler as holding a winning
      hand.  Any Player may allege that a nonsite gambler holds a
      winning hand.  The allegation is considered true if any nonsite
      gambler holds a winning hand at the time of the allegation.

      If the allegation is true, the following events occur in order,
      immediately upon the allegation being made:

        (i) All nonsite gamblers holding winning hands are deemed to
            win the game simultaneously, and are awarded the defined
            regular Patent Title Champion, five white chips, and a
            blue chip (non-transferrable) marked with the number of
            red and white chips in the Pot.

       (ii) The pot is emptied.

      (iii) All Scoring Instructions in the Blueprints Cardbook are
            repealed.

       (iv) All Players' hands become subject to a Hand Reduction to
            the Minimum Hand Size.

      If the allegation is false, the Deckmastor shall, as soon as
      possible, discard 1 card at random from the hand of the Gambler
      who made the allegation.

      If no true allegation of a winning hand or a Skunk has been made
      in the last six months, then any Gambler may allege a Skunk,
      which, if true, triggers the effects of (iii) and (iv) above.

Rule 2083/3 (Power=1)
Hand Reductions

      The Rules may declare that a nonsite Gambler's hand is subject
      to a Hand Reduction.  A particular hand reduction must have a
      maximum hand size associated with it; if none is defined, the
      Maximum Hand Size in the Deckmastor's budget is used.

      As soon as possible after a requirement for a reduction arises,
      the Deckmastor shall:

        (i) Announce the pending hand reduction;

       (ii) Wait at least four days after the announcement;

      (iii) Discard cards at random from that Gambler's hand until eir
            hand size is equal to or less than maximum associated with
            the reduction.

       (iv) If a gambler loses no cards during a reduction, and has
            neither played nor transferred a card since the last
            reduction, the Deckmastor shall discard one card at random
            from the gambler's hand (if it has any cards).

      If a dispute on the gambler's hand size or pending draws is
      raised and not resolved prior to (iii), above, the Deckmastor
      shall not perform (iii) for that hand until the dispute is
      resolved.  If no dispute is raised prior to (iii) being
      performed, then the reduction shall stand regardless of
      subsequent disputes.  However, a Judge in such a dispute may
      Order the Deckmastor to perform further card transfers to
      resolve such disputes.

      If the Deckmastor knowingly reduces a hand incorrectly, e
      commits the Class 4 Crime of Card Thievery.

      If more than one hand reduction is pending for the same hand,
      then the Deckmastor need only perform the reduction for the
      reduction with the lowest associated maximum; this shall satisfy
      all pending reductions.

      At the beginning of each Quarter, every Player's hand becomes
      subject to a hand reduction to the maximum hand size in the
      Deckmastor's Budget plus the number of Offices (including the
      Speakership) that e holds.  If at any time there are more
      unsatisfied pending draws then cards in the Deck and Discard
      Pile put together, the Deckmastor may announce a Shortage, with
      subjects every Player's hand to such a hand reduction.

      come from a mystical place referred to in legend as The House,
      which is to be greatly feared by all gamblers.

      If the rules say that a player loses a chip, without specifying
      which chip e loses:

        (a) If e has at least one red chip, then one of eir red chips
            is forfeited to the Pot.

        (b) Otherwise, if e has at least one white chip, then one of
            eir white chips is forfeited to the Pot.

        (c) Otherwise, if e has at least one card, then the Deckmastor
            shall discard one of that player's cards at random.

        (d) Otherwise, the next chip e gains is immediately forfeited
            to the Pot.

Contreras Card Labs

      There is a cardbook called the Blueprints Cardbook, which may be
      changed by Proposal, or as specified in this Rule.

      Any Player may, with support, add a Blueprint to the Blueprints
      cardbook.  A Blueprint must be a valid card definition.

      Any card added in this manner shall have a quota of 0.

      Any Player may, with support, remove a Blueprint with a quota of
      0 from the Blueprints cardbook.

      If a Blueprint has been in the Blueprints Cardbook for over four
      days, any Player may change the quota of that Blueprint from 0
      to 1 (if the card is unique) or from 0 to a number not greater
      than the number of active Players (if the card is rare or
      common), without three Objections.

      If the quota of a card is changed in this manner, the Deckmastor
      shall create one of the copies of that card in The Library
      rather than in the Deck.

      Any Player may add, delete, or amend a Scoring Instruction in
      the Blueprints Cardbook, with Agoran Consent.

Honorary Degrees

      A degree may be awarded by the operation of an adopted Proposal
      whose Power is at least two to any person who is not registered
      as a Player and who does not already bear that degree.  The
      Proposal must specify both the recipient of the degree and the
      degree to be awarded.  For a degree to be awarded in this
      manner, the recipient need not complete a Thesis, but all other
      requirements specific to the degree in question must be
      satisfied.

      Degrees awarded as described in this rule shall be marked as
      honorary degrees in the Herald's report.  A person bearing an
      honorary degree may still be awarded the same degree by other
      rule-defined mechanisms.  When this occurs, the person shall
      cease to bear the honorary degree and shall bear the new degree
      in its place.

     A person becomes a Candidate for a Degree when e publishes a
     Thesis Draft, authored by emself, along with a statement
     explicitly indicating that the Thesis Draft is being submitted
     with the intent to qualify for a particular degree.

     If the Candidate is a Player, e may choose another Player to be
     the first member of eir Thesis Committee, called eir Chair, with
     the Chair's consent.  For non-players, or if no other Player
     consents to be the Chair within one month of draft submission,
     the Speaker will serve as Chair.

     If the Speaker is neither the Chair nor the Candidate, the
     Speaker shall appoint a Player who is neither the Chair nor the
     Candidate to be the second Committee member.  Otherwise, the
     Justiciar shall so appoint, unless the Chair or the Candidate is
     the Justiciar, in which case the Clerk of the Courts shall so
     appoint.  The two Committee members shall then select, by mutual
     consent, a third person who is not the Candidate to be the third
     Committee member.

     The Committee shall examine the Candidate and eir Thesis to
     determine eir qualifications for the Degree.  The Candidate may
     publish a new Thesis Draft at any time, in response to Committee
     requests or of eir own choosing, by indicating it is a new Thesis
     Draft for the same Degree.

     If the Committee is dissolved without granting a degree, the
     Committee ceases to be a Committee, and the Candidate ceases to
     be a Candidate, and any existent Thesis Draft must be republished
     and subject to a new Committee selection to be eligible for a
     Degree.

     The Chair of a Thesis Committee may dissolve the Committee
     without granting a degree, with the consent of at least one other
     Committee member.  To so dissolve, the Chair must publish a
     notice of intent to dissolve at least 14 days before dissolving.
     The Candidate may so dissolve the Committee at any time by public
     announcement.

     The Chair of the Thesis Committee for a particular Candidate may
     award that Degree to the Candidate if and only if:

      time, the Chair shall publish the most recent Thesis Draft along
      with all Commentary so published.  This combined publication
      shall become the Final Thesis.  Upon publication of this Final
      Thesis the Committee members cease to be Committee members for
      that Thesis.

Rule 786/15 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Conclaves

      When the rules require that a conclave be convened and no
      competing conclave is currently convened, then as soon as
      possible, the Associate Director of Personnel (ADoP) shall
      convene a conclave by announcement, specifying the collection of
      qualified cardinals.  A cardinal is qualified for a conclave
      unless the rules specify otherwise.

      The announcement is ineffective if the ADoP is not required to
      convene a conclave or eir announcement does not list all and
      only the cardinals qualified for that conclave.  However, if
      errors are not announced until after 7 days after the conclave
      concludes, the results shall stand.

      The convening of a conclave initiates an Agoran Decision to
      determine the Pope, a decision in which quorum is zero, the
      voting period is 7 days, all Players are eligible voters, all
      qualified cardinals are valid options as long as they remain
      qualified cardinals, and the ADoP has the privilege of resolving
      ties as for elections.

      The ADoP's announcement of the cardinal chosen by Agora makes
      that cardinal the pope and concludes the conclave.

      If no cardinal may be legally chosen by Agora, the ADoP shall so
      announce, and the conclave concludes as a cliffhanger.  If a
      conclave has not concluded within a fortnight from the time it
      was convened, any player may announce that it is inconclusive
      and thus conclude it as a cliffhanger.  When an conclave
      concludes as a cliffhanger, this canon calls for a consecutive
      conclave to be convened to calculate the correct cardinal.

      If the office of ADoP is ever vacant, or the identity of its
      holder cannot be determined with reasonable certainty, then the
      first player who announces that e convenes a conclave, with eir
      announcement adhering to the conditions for the ADoP's
      announcement, shall then be permitted and required to perform
      the actions that would have been required of the ADoP for that
      conclave.

      e becomes a pope.  Upon this announcement, that player becomes a
      pope, so please treat em right good forever.

      A notice of papal succession is a notice published by the
      Associate Director of Personnel, that declares that a specified
      player is a pope, and is valid if the named player is indeed a
      pope.  Upon publication of a valid notice of papal succession,
      the current Speaker ceases to be Speaker, the pope becomes the
      new Speaker, and the pope ceases to be a pope.

      As soon as possible after any gambler's hand becomes frozen, the
      Deckmastor shall perform the following actions in order:
d5746 12
a5757 26
      1) Calculate and publicly announce the Card Tax for each frozen
         gambler.  The Card Tax for a frozen gambler is equal to the
         hand size of that gambler less the minimum hand size.  The
         Card Tax shall be calculated as of the moment the gambler's
         hand became frozen.

      2) From every frozen gambler in turn, transfer cards selected at
         random from that gambler's hand to the Deck until eir hand
         size has been reduced by an amount not less than eir Card Tax
         or e has no cards remaining.

      3) If the hands were frozen because of a win, deal cards to the
         winner until eir hand size has been increased by the maximum
         hand size less the minimum hand size, calculated as of the
         moment the winner's hand became frozen.

      4) Publicly announce that the table is open for business.

      Upon publication of an announcement as in 4), the Flux of every
      gambler shall become free.  If the Deckmastor makes a public
      announcement as in 4) when one or more gamblers are frozen but
      steps 1), 2), and 3) have not been completed, then the
      announcement is still valid, but the Deckmastor must complete
      steps 1), 2), and 3) as soon as possible.  If the Deckmastor's
      error is not made in good faith, then e commits the Class 4
      Crime of Stacking the Deck.

      The maximum hand size for a Player is defined as the maximum
      hand size in the Deckmastor's Budget plus the number of Offices
      (including the Speakership) that the Player holds.

      Any Player may draw up to three heavy cards in a single month by
      announcement.  If a Player draws a card without specifying the
      explicit circumstances allowing the draw, it shall be considered
      an attempt to draw one of these heavy cards.

      Any Player may draw one free card in a single month, by noting
      it is eir free draw for the month.
d5771 2

      Encumbrance is a stuck switch for pending draws, with values
      Free and Heavy.  Drawing a [Encumbrance value] card is a synonym
      for gaining a pending draw with the indicated encumbrance.

a5796 6
      A heavy pending draw is not satisfiable as long as the gambler
      with the draw has a hand size equal to or greater than eir
      defined maximum hand size.  If a gambler has both heavy and free
      pending draws, the Deckmastor must satisfy all satisfiable heavy
      draws before satisfying any free draws for that gambler.

Prime Executors

      (a) The Prime Executor of an entity with respect to a certain
          action is the Player who is responsible for performing that
          action. For each action that an entity is required to
          perform, there shall be at most one Prime Executor of that
          entity with respect to that action. Any penalty incurred due
          to an entity's failure to perform as required by the Rules
          is incurred by the Prime Executor of that entity.

      (b) Any other Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the Prime
          Executor of an entity with respect to a certain action must
          be an Executor of that entity, or a Limited Executor of that
          entity who is permitted to perform that action on behalf of
          that entity.

      (c) If the Rules designate a Player to be the Prime Executor of
          an entity, without specifying particular actions that the
          Prime Executor is responsible for performing, then that
          Player is the Prime Executor of that entity with respect to
          all actions that the entity is required to perform.

      (d) Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, each Player is eir
          own Prime Executor.

      (e) If a Player is the sole Executor of an entity, then e is the
          Prime Executor of that entity. This provision does not apply
          to a Player who is the sole Limited Executor, but not the
          Executor, of an entity.

      may only be changed as specified by the rules or by an
      instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      If an entity has a defined number of Kudos, but the number has
      not been set by the Rules, then the entity has 1 Kudo.

Rule 1941/4 (Power=1)
Fees

      A fee-based action is an action with which the rules associate a
      fee, which must be a natural number.  If the rules describe a
      fee-based action but do not indicate the fee for that action,
      then that fee is zero.

      A player (the Actor) attempts to perform a fee-based action by
      announcing that e performs it; specifying the action to be
      performed; and, if the fee is nonzero, noting that there is a
      fee for the action.  The Actor has sufficient kudos to perform
      the action if the number of eir kudos meets or exceeds the fee.
      Upon eir announcement, the Actor's kudos are decreased by the
      fee, and if e had sufficient kudos, e performs the action.

      If the success of the Actor's attempt to perform a fee-based
      action is publicly challenged within a week of the time the
      action was attempted, then the Herald shall, as soon as
      possible, determine whether the Actor had sufficient kudos when
      e attempted to perform the action, and announce eir
      determination.

      If the Herald announces that the Actor did not have sufficient
      kudos to perform a fee-based action at the time of eir attempt,
      and eir announcement was published within a fortnight from the
      time the action was attempted, then the action shall be deemed
      not to have been performed.  If the Herald made this
      announcement within a week of the attempt to perform the action,
      or the success of the attempt was publicly challenged within a
      week of the attempt, then the Herald shall refund the Actor eir
      kudos.

      If the success of an Actor's attempt to perform a fee-based
      challenge is not publicly challenged within a week of the time
      the action was attempted, then the action shall be deemed to
      have been performed.

      Nothing in this rule shall act to prevent a person from
      performing a fee-based action by another mechanism for
      performing that action provided by the rules.

      A Patent Title has Ephemeral significance if the rules state
      that the Patent Title is ephemeral.  Karma is a stuck switch for
      ephemeral patent titles with states Boon and Albatross.
      Defining something to be a 'boon' or an 'albatross' is
      equivalent to defining it to be an ephemeral Patent Title with
      its Karma set as defined, and the Karma of a title defined in
      this way is said to be Static.  A Static Karma switch may never
      be changed except by modifying its definition.  A Karma switch
      that is not Static is said to be Dynamic.

      Players may be permitted or required by the Rules to award or
      revoke Boons or Albatrosses.  If so, these awards are performed
      by public announcement by the specified Players.

      A Player may hold multiple instances of a given type of
      ephemeral Patent title; if so, The Herald need only note the
      number of instances of these Patent Titles that each player
      holds.

      cardinals and indicating that those cardinals are to convene a

      (a) the rules require that the conclave be convened;

      (b) no competing conclave is currently convened; and

      (c) the collection consists of qualified cardinals,

      then as of such an announcement, a conclave consisting of the
      qualified cardinals is convened.  A cardinal is qualified for a
      conclave unless the rules specify otherwise.

      The first seven days following the convening of a conclave
      constitute the posturing period.  During the posturing period, a
      qualified cardinal may announce eir intent to become a pope.
      Any other player may publicly support or revoke support for a
      cardinal's claim until the posturing period ends.

      As soon as possible after the posturing period ends, the ADoP
      shall perform the following actions in order:

      (a) E shall determine the cardinal club, which is the collection
          of qualified cardinals with positive support from the
          populace and at least as much unwithdrawn support as any
          other qualified cardinal.

      (b) If the cardinal club has no members, e shall announce this
          fact, and announce the conclave was inconclusive.

      (c) If the cardinal club has at least one member, e shall select
          one of its members to be pope, then publish the list of
          members of the cardinal club, indicating which member is to
          become a pope.  That member becomes a pope as of this
          announcement.

      The ADoP's announcement in (b) or (c) concludes the conclave.
      If the conclave was inconclusive, eir announcement of this fact
      shall constitute a valid call to conclave.  If the conclave has
      not concluded within a fortnight from the time it was convened,
      any player may announce that it is inconclusive; upon such an
      announcement, the conclave shall conclude with an inconclusive
      result, and a conclave must be convened.

Timing of Multiple Events in One Message

      Whenever a message contains more than one action -- such as a
      notification, report, or other communication -- on which the
      Rules place some legal significance, the actions in that message
      shall be taken to have been sent sequentially in the order which
      they appear in the message.

      If a message attempts to perform multiple actions simultaneously
      without explicitly stating a specific order for the actions,
      then the attempt shall be considered ambiguous and without
      effect if the gamestate would be substantively different for any
      two orderings of the actions. For the purposes of this test, the
      actual order the actions are performed in is not considered
      substantive, but other differences may, at the discretion of a
      judge, be considered substantive.

a558 32
      The Registrar may, without objection, flip the publicity of a
      forum.  In addition to any other requirements the rules place on
      this action, the Registrar's announcement of intent must be sent
      to that forum, and if the forum is being made Public, then the
      announcement by which the Registrar performs the modification
      must be sent to all existing Public fora.

      It is the responsibility of each active player to ensure that e
      can receive messages via each Public forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all Public or
      Discussion fora and sufficient data regarding each such forum to
      allow players to receive messages via that medium.  The
      Registrar need not keep track of fora with null state.

      A message is not public unless some rule states that it is
      public.  A message is public if it is sent via a Public forum,
      or if it is sent to all players via a combination of fora and
      contains a clear designation of intent to be public.

      A player publishes information by publicly sending a message
      containing that information, and announces something by
      publishing it.

      If the rules state that a player may perform an action by
      announcement, then that player may perform that action by
      announcing that e performs it.  If the rules state that a player
      may perform an action by private message to some player, then
      that player may perform that action by sending a message
      privately to the specified player indicating that e performs it.
      In either case, such a message must unambiguously describe the

      at the time date-stamped on that message, and any attempts by em

Ratification Without Objection
d1411 29
a1439 63
      Any Officer who holds an Office in Normal Fashion can Ratify an
      Official Report Without Objection, provided the following
      conditions hold;

        i) The Report to be Ratified is one that is legally
           permissible to Ratify.
       ii) The Report to be Ratified was produced by the Player
           holding the Office.
      iii) The Report to be Ratified is one that is required to be
           produced and maintained by the Officer.

      A Speaker who is not Tainted is permitted to Ratify any Official
      Report Without Objection provided that the Report is one legally
      permissible to Ratify.

      A COE on any Report undergoing this process shall be deemed by
      the Rules to constitute an Objection.

[CFJ 1207 (14 April 2000) found that this rule allows a report to be
 ratified by an Officer, even in the face of Rule 1550, which requires
 that the only instrument capable of ratifying a report be a
 Proposal.  In effect, Players are not instruments.]

Rule 1551/5 (Power=1)
Documents Subject to Ratification

      The ratification of an Official Document conforms the Game State
      to what it would be if the valid Official Document thus ratified
      was completely true and accurate at the time the Document was
      published.  In other words, the State of the Game, upon such
      ratification, becomes that specified within the Document, plus
      all subsequent legal changes between the time of its publication
      and its ratification.

      All Game State changes due to the ratification of an Official
      Document occur at the time of such ratification; no retroactive
      effect is expressed or implied.

      A Document, once ratified, is for all legal purposes a true and
      accurate report.  The Game State it references may not be
      retroactively modified prior to the time it was published, even
      to reflect a prior mistake, retracted or illegal move, or an
      Order.  This Rule takes precedence over any Rule that would
      allow such retroactive alterations or corrections to the Game
      State.

      In no way does the ratification of a Document invalidate,
      reverse, alter or cancel any prior moves or transfers, even
      unrecorded or overlooked ones.  Nor does the ratification of a
      Document change the legality or illegality of any prior move.
      Ratification only adjusts the actual Game State to conform to
      that perceived by the Players and Officers in Official
      Documentation.

      After a Document has been ratified, the Player in charge of
      maintaining that Document shall annotate all subsequent
      publications of that Document with the date of publication of
      the last such publication that was ratified.

Rule 1552/4 (Power=1)
Requirements for Ratification

      An Official Document is legally permissible to Ratify if and
      only if all of the following are true:

      a) The Rules required some specific Player to produce and/or
         maintain the document.

      b) The Rules required it to be published.  (A requirement that
         it be sent to all Players fulfills this criterion.)

      c) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error (COE).

      d) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for Judgement
         (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.

      e) The information within the Document has not been superseded
         by a subsequent Document that contradicts it.  (This does not
         apply if a COE alleging the contradiction is in error is
         admitted.)

      f) The Document is not the Ruleset.  The Ruleset is specifically
         excluded from Ratification.

      Ratification by Proposal is effective only if the Document is
      legally permissible to Ratify when the Proposal takes effect.

      The Deckmastor is an office whose responsibilities include
      shuffling, dealing, and other random actions concerning cards,
      and who acts as the recordkeepor for Cards.  The Deckmastor's
      Weekly Report shall contain a record of all Cards in existence,
      recent card actions, and what entity possesses each Card.

      The Deck and the Discard Pile are Gamblers.  The Deckmastor
      shall be the sole Executor of both entities, but may take no
      action on behalf of them except as explicitly permitted by the
      Rules.  The Deck and Discard Pile may not transfer cards to any
      other entity except as explicitly required by the Rules.

      Only the Deckmastor may create or destroy Cards, and e only may
      do so when the rules require it.  The Deckmastor creates or
      destroys a card by announcement, specifying as appropriate the
      entity who now possesses it or previously possessed it.

      If at any time fewer Copies of a defined Class of Cards exist
      than its Quota, then the Deckmastor shall create a Copy of that
      Card in the possession of The Deck, unless otherwise specified.
      If at any time more Copies of a Class of Cards exist than its
      Quota, then the Deckmastor shall destroy a Copy of that Card in
      the possession of The Deck, unless no such Copies exist, in
      which case the Deckmastor shall destroy a random Copy.

      A Cardbook is a document, maintained by the Deckmastor, that is
      specifically defined in the Rules as being a Cardbook.  The
      Deckmastor must publish each cardbook as soon as possible after
      its contents change, and at least once a month.  The contents of
      a cardbook may only be changed as explicitly permitted by the
      Rules.

      Cardbook, specifically layout, whitespace, and the order of
d5628 39
a5666 32
      A class of card is considered defined if and only if a valid
      definition for that card class exists in a cardbook.  A valid
      card definition defines a Class of Card by specifying a Caption,
      a Frequency, zero or more Elements, and zero or more Exploits.

      (a) The Caption shall be the name of a particular Class of
          Cards. No two Classes of Cards shall have the same Caption.

      (b) The Frequency, which may have one of the following values:
          Common, Rare, Unique.  If any other value is specified, the
          frequency shall be considered to be Unique.

      (c) A cardbook may define Elements for Cards. Each Element shall
          have a name and a description. Any Card possessing the
          Element of that name shall behave according to the
          description associated with that Element. An Element not
          defined in a cardbook has no effect.

      (d) An Exploit is an action that the Holder of that Card (and
          only the Holder of that Card) may take if and only if e
          clearly indicates the card whose Exploit e is performing and
          e meets the requirements and/or pays the costs outlined in
          that Exploit. Any reference to "you," "your" or a similar
          pronoun in the text of an Exploit refers to the Holder of
          that Card. Taking an action described in an Exploit is known
          as Playing the Card. Unless a Rule or card definition says
          otherwise, a Card is automatically transferred to the
          Discard Pile immediately after being Played.

      All Cards of the same Class shall be identical and fungible.
      Each individual instance of a Card shall be considered to be a
      Copy of that Class of Card.

      I. Possession
d5717 54
a5770 53
      Cards may be possessed by Gamblers. All Players are Gamblers.
      If at any time a Card is not possessed by a Gambler, it
      immediately and automatically returns to the possession of The
      Deck.

      The Gambler that possesses a Card is that Card's Holder and
      Holds that Card. All Cards possessed by a particular Gambler are
      collectively referred to as that Gambler's Hand. A Gambler's
      Hand Size is the number of Cards in eir Hand plus one for each
      Pending Draw for that Gambler.

      II. Actions

      No action involving Cards may be simultaneous with any other
      action. No such action may be performed more than once
      simultaneously. If any attempt is made to perform more than one
      such action in such a way that the order of said actions is
      unclear, all such actions fail.

      (a) Unless restricted from doing so by the rules, any Gambler
          possessing a Card may transfer that Card to any other
          Gambler by announcing which Card is to be transferred and
          the Gambler it shall be transferred to. All such transfers
          take place at the time they are announced.

          If a Gambler transfers a card to the Deck, it is instead
          transferred to the discard pile, unless the transfer is made
          as part of the Deckmastor's required duties.  Discarding a
          Card is synonymous with transferring said Card to the
          Discard Pile.

      (b) Drawing a Card and Drawing from The Deck are synonymous.

          When a Gambler Draws a Card, the Deckmastor shall be
          required to randomly select one Card from among those
          currently in The Deck's Hand and transfer it to that Gambler
          as soon as possible. Until this transfer takes place, that
          Gambler is said to have one Pending Draw for each such
          transfer the Deckmastor is required to make, but has not yet
          made.  Whenever a player makes a true announcement that the
          number of pending draws for all gamblers is greater than the
          number of cards in the Deck, or that there are no cards in
          the Deck, then the Deckmastor shall transfer all of the
          cards in the Discard Pile to the Deck before dealing any
          cards.  This transfer is known as a Reshuffle and is
          performed as a single action.

          A Gambler whose Hand Size is smaller than the maximum Hand
          Size, plus the number of Offices e holds, plus one if e is
          Speaker, may draw a card from The Deck.  The fee for this
          action is a number of Kudos equal to the number of times
          during the current month e has previously drawn a card in
          this manner.

            stated in the Rules,

        ii) The Proposal is Democratic.

      A Sane Proposal has its Distribution Cost increased by 1.

Legality of Bonus Clauses

      The following Element is defined for cards:

        initial quota set equal to one plus the number of Players who
        voted FOR the Proposal that first defined that class of card
        as Grafty.  When the Deckmastor initially creates cards to
        fulfil this quota, e shall, Rules to the contrary
        notwithstanding, first destroy all existing copies of the
        card, then create one copy in the possession of the Deck, and
        finally create one copy in the possession of each Player who
        voted FOR said proposal.

Deregistration Due to Silence

      Noisiness is a stuck player switch with values noisy, quiet, and
      silent.

      The noisiness of an active player may not be changed if e has
      posted to a public forum in the past 120 hours.

      A non-noisy player becomes noisy whenever e posts to a public
      forum.

      An active player may flip another active player's noisiness from
      noisy to quiet, unless e has done so for another player within
      the past 24 hours.

      If a player has been quiet continuously for one month, or
      inactive continuously for three months, e becomes silent.

      Any player may publish a Notice of Abandonment, identifying
      another player and alleging that that player has abandoned the
      game. A Notice of Abandonment is or becomes invalid if the
      player identified in it is not, or ceases to be, silent.

Rule 2036/2 (Power=1)
d1216 25
a1240 2
      (a) The publication of a Notice of Abandonment commences the
          Silent Treatment for the player identified in it.
d1242 2
a1243 34
      (b) The requirement to perform the actions described in this
          Rule is subject to the Notice of Abandonment remaining
          valid. If at any time during the Silent Treatment the of
          Abandonment is invalid, then the Treatment is terminated,
          and the Registrar is relieved of all powers and
          responsibilities regarding it.

      (c) As soon as possible after the commencement of the Silent
          Treatment, the Registrar shall:

          (1) publicly confirm whether the Notice of Abandonment was
              valid at the commencement of the Silent Treatment, and
              whether it remains valid;

          (2) publish in all designated Public Fora, and send to each
              listed e-mail address of the player, a Notice of Intent
              to Deregister, identifying the player to be deregistered
              (the same as in the Notice of Abandonment), and
              announcing the Registrar's intent to deregister that
              player after one month has passed.

      (d) If the Notice of Abandonment remains valid a month after the
          publication of the Notice of Intent to Deregister, then the
          Registrar shall, as soon as possible, publish in all
          designated Public Fora, and send to each listed e-mail
          address of the player, a Notice of Deregistration,
          identifying the player being deregistered (as in the Notice
          of Abandonment). The only player so far to have returned to
          the game after becoming a zombie is Oerjan. The Notice is
          valid if and only if it is published by the Registrar,
          following the procedures described in this Rule.

      (e) Upon publication of a valid Notice of Deregistration, the
          following events occur in order:
d1245 1
a1245 2
          (1) if the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration

          (2) the player identified in the Notice of Deregistration is

          (3) the Silent Treatment for that player concludes.

      Paperwork is a stuck switch for Offices with states Low and
      High.  The Associate Director of Personnel is the recordkeepor
      for paperwork.  For the purpose of this rule, the Speaker and
      the Distributor are considered offices.  The Associate Director
      of Personnel or the Speaker may switch the paperwork of an
      office with two supporters and without two objections.

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Associate Director of Personnel shall award 1 Public Service
      Boon for each office to the player (if any) who held that office
      for 16 or more days in the previous month; e shall award an
      additional Public Service boon to that player if the office is a
      high paperwork office.

      Each office may make one Proposal distributable per month
      without payment of a fee, by the electee of that office publicly
      invoking that office's Civil Service Exemption.

Rule 1965/4 (Power=2)
Complacent Corporation

      As soon as possible after an ordinary proposal fails quorum, the
      Assessor shall publish a Notice of Complacency to that effect.
      In addition, at any time during the voting period of an ordinary
      proposal for which the number of entities eligible to vote on
      the proposal is less than the quorum of the proposal, the
      Assessor may immediately publish a Notice of Complacency without
      waiting for the proposal's voting period to end.

      When the Assessor publishes a Notice of Complacency for a
      proposal, it becomes extraordinary.

      Publication by the Assessor of a Notice of Complacency not
      strictly authorized or required by this rule is the Class 2
      Crime of Sending It Back Where It Don't Belong.

      If the Rules associate a non-negative cost, price, charge, or
      fee with an action, that action is a fee-based action.  If the
      specified cost is not an integer, the actual fee is the next
      highest integer.

      To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
      is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
      that action.  Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee.

      Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
      Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
      action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
      attempted action.

      As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
      confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
      greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.  If the
      Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor of the
      Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
      shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
      shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.

      the Player in possession gains three instances of the ephemeral

Procedure to Impeach an Officer
d1863 15
a1877 15
      Any Active Player is permitted to call a Referendum to
      Impeach an Officer at any time, by publicly requesting such.
      The Officer is Impeached when such a Referendum is passed.

      The Referendum must list both the Office and the current
      Electee to that Office by name. If upon passage of the
      Referendum the named Player is the current Electee of
      that Office, then the Player is immediately removed
      from Office.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for referenda is
      modified as follows: Vote Collector is the Player who called for
      the Impeachment Referendum. Voters do not include the Officer
      under consideration for Impeachment. Adoption Ratio must be
      greater than or equal to 2 for the Referendum to pass.

      A Proposal is created when a Legislator who is not Mute
      publishes a body of text with the clear indication that it is
      intended to become a Proposal.  The collection of text becomes a
      Proposal and the entity delivering that text becomes the
      Proposer of that Proposal. This process is known as Proposing or
      submitting a Proposal.
d2377 1
a2377 5
      The publishing of the Proposal Pool never creates new

      Rule Changes that affect Rules needed to allow or apply Rule
      Changes are as permissible as other Rule Changes.  Even Rule
      Changes that amend or repeal their own authority are
      permissible.  No Rule Change or type of move is impermissible
      solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a
      Rule.

Rule 1339/6 (Power=3)
Precision in Rule Changes
d2478 8
a2485 23
      Exact precision is required in the specification of Rule
      Changes; any ambiguity or irregularity in the specification of a
      Rule Change causes it to be void and without effect.

      Variations in whitespace or capitalization in the quotation of
      text in an existing Rule to be removed or replaced does not
      create an irregularity or ambiguity, for the purpose of this
      Rule.  Any other variation, however, does.

Rule 594/8 (Power=3)
Power and Proposals
d2487 3
a2489 15
      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.  Except as
      described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power of any
      entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing the Power to be
      so set.  No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power
      greater than its own.

      When a Proposal takes effect, its Power shall be set equal to
      its Adoption Index, and the provisions contained in the text of
      the Proposal are implemented to the maximal extent permitted by
      the Rules.

      Provisions which are unclear, ambiguous, or inapplicable are
      ignored.  In a Proposal containing more than one provision, each
      provision is severable from the others, unless the Proposal
      states otherwise.

         an Adoption Index for that Proposal by announcement,
         specifying the requested value.
d2528 5
a2532 11
      3) When a Proposal is distributed, its Adoption Index is set to

         a) its Default Adoption Index; and

         b) any values requested by its Proposer as permitted in 2).

      4) This is the only mechanism for setting or changing the
         Adoption Index of a Proposal.  This Rule takes precedence
         over Rules that would allow other mechanisms for setting or
         changing the Adoption Index of a Proposal.

Rule 1724/9 (Power=1)
Urgent Proposals

      A Proposal is Urgent if the text of the message wherein it is
      submitted explicitly states that it is an Urgent Proposal.

      An Urgent Proposal has its Distribution Cost increased by 1.

      The Promotor may distribute an Urgent Proposal as soon as it
      becomes Distributable, and e is required to do so within five
      days. Failure to do so is the Class 1 Infraction of Lack of
      Urgency, which may be reported by any Player.

      The Voting Period of an Urgent Proposal is five days from the
      time the Proposal is distributed.

Sanitizing Proposals

      When a non-Sane Proposal in the Pool is Sanitized, it becomes
      Democratic and Sane.

      When a non-Sane Proposal whose Voting Period has begun but has
      not yet ended is Sanitized, it is Aborted as described
      elsewhere, and the copy resulting from the Abortion remains
      Distributable but becomes Democratic and Sane.

      A Proposal may only be Sanitized by the operation of an
      Instrument whose Power is at least 2.

      to distributable by paying a fee equal to its Distribution Cost
      minus one (minimum zero).

      (b) During each Week, the Promotor is required to distribute

          Distributable.

      (c) If there were no Distributable Proposals at the beginning of

          this fact at some time during the Week.

      (d) Failure by the Promotor to either distribute Proposals as

          Index, and an indication of the Proposal's Chamber. However,
          the failure of the Promotor to include any of these
          accompaniments with a Proposal does not deprive the
          distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      (f) A Proposal is legally distributed only if it is accompanied
          by an explicit indication that it is being distributed. When
          a Proposal is distributed, it is removed from the Proposal
          Pool.

      (g) The Promotor shall not distribute any Proposal which is not
          Distributable, and must abort any Proposal so distributed.
          If the Promotor aborts a Proposal which e knows was
          Distributable at the time it was distributed, e commits the
          Class 2 Crime of Illegal Abortion.

      (h) The Promotor aborts a Proposal by publishing an announcement
          to that effect, clearly identifying the Proposal which has
          been aborted.

      (i) The distribution of an Undistributable Proposal, when the
          Promotor knows that the Proposal is Undistributable, is the
          Class 2 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation.  The
          distribution of a text purporting to be a Proposal, when the
          Promotor knows that the text is not a Proposal, is the Class
          5 Crime of Promotor Fraud.

Takeover Proposals

      Initiative is a stuck player switch, tracked by the Assessor,
      with values Gote and Sente.

      A Takeover Proposal is a proposal meeting these requirements:

        (a) It is labelled as a Takeover Proposal.
        (b) No Takeover Proposal has been submitted earlier in the
            same month.
        (c) It specifies a set of players (hereafter the Corporate
            Raiders) that is no larger than P/2 or smaller than P/3,
            where P is the number of active noisy players at the time
            of submission.

      Rules to the Contrary nonwithstanding, a Takeover Proposal is
      both Democratic and Sane.

      Upon submission of a Takeover Proposal, all other Takeover
      Proposals become Undistributable and are removed from the Pool.

      At the beginning of a Takeover Proposal's voting period, the
      initiative of each player is set to Gote.  At the end of a
      Takeover Proposal's voting period, the initiative of each player
      is set as follows:

        (a) Adopted:  All Corporate Raiders gain Sente.
        (b) Rejected:  All other players gain Sente.
        (c) Failed quorum:  No one gains Sente.

          power of 2 or greater.  Rules to the contrary
          nonwithstanding, if the current value of the Political

      An Ordinary Proposal with Adoption Index of two (2) or greater

      is distributed that was Stalled at the time of distribution, the
      Promotor shall abort it as soon as possible.

      Every Proposal is initially Democratic, unless its Adoption
      Index is less than two (2), in which case it is initially
      Ordinary.  The Chamber of a Proposal may only be changed as
      specified by an instrument with Power greater than or equal to

            (2) the Deckmastor: the number of Share Cards in the Deck

                Holdings (if e is a Shareholder);
            (3) Any other entity: zero.

      (b) An entity's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as
          follows:
          (1) A Player:
                  (i)  that Player's Voting Potential if that Player
                       has Sente.
                  (ii) one otherwise.
          (2) Any other entity: as defined in the Rules, with a
              default of zero if the Rules don't specify the Voting
              power on a Democratic Proposal for that entity.

      (c) The value of an entity's Voting Power for any given Chamber
          at the beginning of each Week shall be in effect for all
          Proposals distributed during that Week. However, if a
          Proposal's Chamber is changed after it has been distributed,
          the Voting Power of each entity for that Proposal is
          redetermined at the time the Chamber is changed.

          in any combination, up to the limit determined by that
          entity's Voting Power on that Proposal, with the exceptions
          that:

      (a) There are three possible modes of voting on Issues: Public,
          Private and Unrestricted.  If not otherwise defined, the
          prevailing mode for each class of Issue is Public.

      (b)  (1) The Assessor may change the prevailing mode of voting
               for Proposals, with Support.

           (2) The Associate Director of Personnel may change the
               prevailing mode of voting for Elections, with Support.

           (3) The prevailing mode of Referenda is always Public.

      (c) When the Voting Period on an Issue begins, the mode of
          voting for that particular Issue is permanently set to the
          prevailing mode for that class of Issue.

      (d)  (1) If the mode of voting is Public, then any other Rule to
               the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any votes,
               or the declaration of Presence, by Voters on that
               Issue, may only be achieved by sending a message to the
               Public Forum.

           (2) If the mode of voting is Private, then any other Rule
               to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of any
               votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may only be achieved by sending a
               message privately to the Vote Collector.

           (3) If the mode of voting is Unrestricted, then any other
               Rule to the contrary notwithstanding, the casting of
               any votes, or the declaration of Presence, by Voters
               on that Issue, may be achieved by sending a message
               either publicly or privately.

      (e) If the mode of voting is Private or Unrestricted, then the
          status of any votes cast privately is secret until the end
          of the voting period.  Any player who knowingly reveals the
          status of any vote to any player besides the Assessor

          a Voting Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no
          votes against, and at least one vote for, the Voting Index
          shall be Unanimity; if there are no votes for, the Voting
          Index shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index

      upon other Proposals, all such Proposals shall take effect at
      the same time, but in the order in which they were distributed.

      A Rule's Amendment Number shall be displayed in Official copies
      of the Ruleset, appended to the Rule Number, and separated by a
      forward slash.  Responsibility is given to the Rulekeepor to

      When a Referendum Vote is required and the procedure is not
      defined elsewhere, the following Standard Referendum Voting
      Procedure shall be used.  Details specified herein are defaults
      which may be modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      This procedure shall under no circumstances be used for Voting
      on Proposals, unless specifically required by the Rules
      governing specific types of Proposals.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for
        collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing the results.
        The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the Referendum
        begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the results
        of the Referendum, then the Referendum fails.

      * Voters:  For the purpose of this Rule, a Voter is an entity
        permitted to Vote on a Referendum.  Only Active Players are
        Voters.  Activity is measured at the time a Vote is sent.

      * Voting: A Voter Votes by sending eir Vote to the Vote
        Collector during the Voting Period, indicating what Referendum
        e is Voting on, and what eir Vote is.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is FOR, AGAINST, or ABSTAIN.  Words which
        are effectively synonymous with these are also permissible.

      * Vote Strength: Every Vote has equal strength.  No Voter may
        Vote more than once on any single Referendum.

      * Retraction: During the Voting period a Voter may change or
        cancel any Vote e has sent to the Vote Collector by notifying
        the Vote Collector.

      * Start of Voting: The Voting Period begins at the time of the
        first correct and legal public announcement that a Referendum
        has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement
        must include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Voting: The Voting Period lasts for one Week.  All
        Votes received by the Vote Collector outside of the Voting
        Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy During Voting: At any time, the Vote Collector may
        publish a list of Voters who have Voted.  However, the Vote
        Collector shall not reveal the value of any Voter's Vote to
        anyone but that Voter, unless e has the Voter's permission to
        do so.

      * Announcement of Results: As soon as possible after the end of
        the Voting Period, the Vote Collector shall announce the
        number of Votes of each kind, as well as the name and Vote of
        each Entity that Voted. If e does not do this as soon as
        possible, then the Referendum fails.

      * Quorum: Quorum is one third of the eligible Voters at the
        beginning of the Voting Period.  If fewer Voters Vote, then
        the Referendum fails.

      * Adoption Index:  The Adoption Index of a Referendum is 1.

      * Adoption Ratio: The Adoption Ratio of a Referendum is the
        ratio of FOR Votes to AGAINST Votes.  If the Adoption Ratio is
        greater than the Adoption Index (or if both are Unanimity),
        and if the Referendum does not fail for some other reason,
        then it passes; otherwise, it fails.

      * Effectiveness: A Referendum takes effect when the Vote
        Collector correctly announces that it passes.  The effect of a
        Referendum is defined by other Rules.

      When an Election is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the following Standard Election Procedure shall be
      used.  Details specified herein are defaults which may be
      modified by other Rules for specific situations.

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector is responsible for taking
        nominations, collecting and tallying the Votes, and announcing
        the results.  The Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time
        the Election begins.

      * Disappearance of Vote Collector: If the Vote Collector
        deregisters or is deregistered before announcing the winner of
        the Election, then the Election has no winner.

      * Nominator: A Nominator is an entity permitted to Nominate a
        Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players are Nominators.
        Activity is measured at the time a Nomination is sent.

      * Prospective: A Prospective is an entity permitted to be
        Nominated as a Candidate in an Election.  Only Active Players
        are Prospectives.  Activity is measured at the time a
        Nomination is sent.

      * Nominating: A Nominator Nominates a Prospective by sending a
        message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Candidates: A Candidate for an Election is a Prospective who
        has been Nominated in that Election.

      * Retraction: A Nominator may retract eir Nomination by sending
        a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating Period,
        indicating the Election and the Prospective.  If the
        Prospective is not explicitly identified, then it is the same
        as the Nominator.

      * Declination: A Prospective may decline eir Nomination by
        sending a message to the Vote Collector during the Nominating
        Period, indicating the Election.  Upon doing so, e may not be
        re-Nominated in that Election by anyone but emself.

      * Mode of Nominations: There are three Modes of Nominations:
        Selfish, Selfless, or Open.  The Vote Collector may specify a
        Mode of Nominations when e announces the start of the
        Election; if e does not, then the Mode is Selfish.

        (a) In a Selfish Election, a Nominator may Nominate only
            emself.
        (b) In a Selfless Election, a Nominator may not Nominate
            emself.
        (c) In an Open Election, a Nominator may Nominate any
            Prospective.

      * Start of Nominations: The Nominating Period begins at the time
        of the first correct and legal announcement that an Election
        has begun, as defined in other Rules.  Such an announcement
        must include the identity of the Vote Collector.

      * Duration of Nominations: The Nominating Period lasts for one
        Week.  All Nominations received by the Vote Collector outside
        of the Nominating Period have no effect.

      * Secrecy:  Nominations need not be kept secret.

      * End of Nominations: As soon as possible after the end of the
        Nominating Period, the Vote Collector shall publish a list of
        all Candidates.  If e does not do this as soon as possible,
        then the Election has no winner.

      If there are no Candidates, then the Election has no winner.

      If there is exactly one Candidate, then e is the winner of that
      Election.

      If there are two or more Candidates, then a Referendum begins
      when the Vote Collector publishes the list of Candidates.  This
      is a standard Referendum, with the following exceptions:

      * Vote Collector: The Vote Collector for the Referendum is the
        same as the Vote Collector for the Election.

      * Vote Values: A Vote is the name of exactly one Candidate for
        the given Election.  Words which are effectively synonymous
        with these are also permissible.

      * Failure of Referendum: If the Referendum fails for any reason
        (e.g. Quorum is not achieved), then the Election has no
        winner.

      * Adoption: The winner of the Election is the Candidate for whom
        the most Votes were cast.  If two or more Candidates are tied
        for most Votes, then the Speaker shall choose one of those
        Candidates, who becomes the winner when the Speaker announces
        eir choice.  The Speaker shall announce eir choice as soon as
        possible after the Vote Collector announces the results of
        Voting.

      * Effectiveness: An Election takes effect when the Vote
        Collector correctly announces the identity of its winner.  The
        effect of an Election is defined by other Rules.
d3561 1
d3568 11
a3578 19
      When the Rules require that an Election be conducted to fill
      an Office, that Election shall be conducted in accordance with
      the usual Rules for Elections, with the following exceptions:

      * The Vote Collector is the Associate Director of Personnel at
        the time the Election begins, unless the Election seeks to
        fill the Office of Associate Director of Personnel, in which
        case the Vote Collector is the Speaker at the time the
        Election begins.

      * No Player may be Nominated who, at the time of attempted
        Nomination, would not be permitted to hold the Office which
        the Election is seeking to fill.

      * If the Vote Collector fails to meet an ASAP requirement to
        publish a list of Candidates, or the identity of the winning
        Candidate, then the Election/Referendum does not fail, but
        becomes Stale.  If a new Election for the same Office is
        initiated, then the stale Election/Referendum fails.

Rule 1835/4 (Power=1)
Standing Down

      During the Voting Period of an Election, any Candidate for that
      Election may stand down, by posting a public message to that
      effect. The player is then no longer to be considered a
      Candidate for that Election. Any further votes cast in eir
      favour are invalid, and e cannot win the Election.

      Any votes cast for a Player who stands down are cancelled, and
      any Player who cast such a vote is considered to have declared
      eir Presence in that Election.  Additionally, any Player who
      cast such a vote may vote again, unless e has already cast
      another vote which remains uncancelled, and this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which would prevent such a vote.

      If, at any time during the Voting Period of an Election, there
      remains only a single Candidate, the Voting Period ends
      immediately, with the sole remaining Candidate as the winner of
      that Election.

      There is a format of the Ruleset known as the Short Logical
      Ruleset (SLR).  In this format, each Rule is assigned to a Rule
      Category, and the Rules are grouped according to their Category.
      Within a Category, the ordering of Rules is decided by the
      Rulekeepor.  All existing Rule Categories must be listed, even
      if no Rules are currently assigned to the Category.

      The listing of each Rule in the SLR must include:
        * The Rule Number
        * The Rule's Amendment Number
        * The Rule's Power
        * The Rule's Title

I Was Only Obeying Orders

      A Player who performs as required by an Order which is later
      found to be invalid shall not be convicted of a Crime, nor
      penalized by being billed, being removed from or retired
      from Office, becoming Tainted, or being deregistered,
      solely as a result of performing as required by the Order.
      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule which would cause

d4264 5
a4268 9
      An Order which commands the performance of an action may specify
      when that action is to be performed; if no specification is
      given, or the specification given would require the
      performance of the action at a time when the Order is without
      effect, or if the specification given would allow less than
      72 hours from the time when the Order takes effect to perform
      the action, then the Order shall be taken to require the
      performance of the action as soon as possible after the Order
      takes effect.
d4273 9
a4281 16
      takes effect, but before the Order is satisfied, and the
      specification would require the performance of the action at a
      time before the current holder of the position came to hold
      that position, or would allow less than 72 hours from the time
      the current holder of the position came to hold that position,
      then the Order shall be taken to require the performance of the
      action as soon as possible after the current holder of the
      position came to hold that position.  However, this shall
      not be taken to absolve the previous holder of the position
      of any penalties e might otherwise incur.

      Other Rules may establish other times by which Orders must be
      performed.  The noncompliance of an Order with this Rule does
      not deprive that Order of all effect, but instead modifies the
      effect of that Order with respect to the time at which or by
      which the actions it requires must be performed.

Rule 1796/0 (Power=1)
Validity of Orders

      All Orders executed in the manner prescribed by the Rules for
      their class and type are presumed valid and enforceable until
      proven otherwise by CFJ.

      In order to be proven valid by CFJ, the Rules must permit the
      Player who executed the Order in question to execute such an
      Order, that the execution of the Order must have been required
      by or permitted in the circumstances which existed at the time
      it was executed, and that the Order has not been rendered
      invalid by the operation of any other Rule.

      Furthermore, no Order may act to prevent or hinder its own
      appeal in any way, and any portion of an Order which has this
      effect is void and without force.

Amendment, Stay, and Vacation of Orders

      Any Order may always be amended, stayed, or vacated by the
      Player (or, in the case of Appellate Orders, Board of Appeal)
      who executed it. Certain classes of Orders may be amended,
      stayed, or vacated in other circumstances as well, when the
      Rules so allow. In all cases, this is done by an Order to
      Amend, Stay, or Vacate, respectively, the original Order.

Rule 1800/0 (Power=1)
Amendment of Orders

      The effect of amending an Order is to cause it to be effective
      in its amended form.  The prior form of the Order ceases to have
      effect upon the amendment, and the new form has effect as if it
      had been originally executed in that form at the moment the
      amendment becomes effective.

      Vacating an Order to Amend has the same effect as would an Order
      to Amend reinstating the previous form of the Order.

      Amending a stayed or vacated Order does not grant the stayed or
      vacated Order effect it would otherwise not have.

Appeal of Administrative and Private Orders

      Both Administrative and Private Orders are subject to appeal by

      is improperly or invalidly executed.

      Upon a judicial finding that an Administrative or Private Order
      was improperly or invalidly executed, the Judge so finding shall
      vacate that Order.

      When the Clerk of the Courts receives a properly executed Call
      for Judgement, the statement of which alleges that an
      Administrative or Private Order was improperly or invalidly
      executed, the Clerk of the Courts shall stay the Order in
      dispute.  If the Judge affirms the validity of the original

      Any person who is not registered as a player may do so by
      sending a message to a public forum announcing that e registers
      as a player.  Unless other rules provide additional necessary
      conditions for registration that have not been fulfilled or the
      rules otherwise prohibit the person from registering, e
      immediately becomes a registered player.

      Readiness is a stuck player switch with values ready and
      unready.

      An unready player may flip eir readiness to ready.

      Whenever a player registers, and that player has not previously
      been registered as a player in Agora at any time within the 365
      previous days, e becomes unready and is subject to a Grace
      Period that begins at the time of eir registration and lasts
      sixty days, not including Holidays.  A player is only subject to
      the Grace Period resulting from eir own registration.

      Whenever a Player's Grace Period concludes, e becomes Ready.

      A collective of two or more persons (a Hive) none of whom is

      of its members would have been subject to a Grace Period had e
      registered as an individual at the time the Hive registered.

      This rule takes precedence over rule 869.

Truth in Advertising

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of evidence submitted in support of a Claim of Error, Call for
      Judgement, or Judgement, or in response to a Judicial or
      Appellate Order requiring that Player to disclose information
      known to that Player, commits the Class 10 Crime of Perjury.

      Any Player who willfully makes a false statement of fact as part
      of a public message, as any part of a response to a request for
      information where that Player was required to respond, or as
      part of a message to an Officer upon which that Officer is then
      required to act, commits the Class 4 Crime of Misrepresentation.

      For the purposes of this Rule, the Speaker shall be considered
      an Officer.

      For the purpose of this Rule, for a Player to "willfully make a
      false statement of fact", all of the following conditions must
      be true at the time the Player makes the statement.

        a) The Player must present the statement as if it were true.

        b) The Player must know that the statement is false.  In
           particular, the following things are not willful: excusable
           negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable reliance on the
           representations of another.

        c) The statement is not a conclusion as to the interpretation
           of the Rules, or as to their application to a particular
           situation.

[CFJ 827: If it is not clear that information is *not* presented
 as correct, it is.  Attempting an illegal move can, if the Player
 reports the move and knows it to be illegal, be a violation of this
 Rule.]

d2092 36
a2127 32
      A Rebellious player may Call for a Revolt at any time by
      publicly announcing e does so. A Call for Revolt is only
      effective if no other Call for Revolt has been made that week
      and no successful Revolt has occurred for a month or more.

      As soon as possible after an effective Call for Revolt has been
      posted, the Registrar must determine whether the Revolt
      succeeds, as outlined below, and publicly announce the result.

      The Registrar shall select a random integer from 1 to the number
      of players (plus 1 if Miscreant is Borne). If this number is
      less than or equal to the number of Rebellious players (plus
      1 if Miscreant is Borne by a Rebellious player), then the
      Revolt succeeds; otherwise it fails. All numbers used in this
      calculation are determined at the time of the Call for Revolt.

      If a Revolt succeeds, then the following events occur in order:

         - The Registrar shall expunge the Blots of each Rebellious
           player
         - The Registrar shall grant the ephemeral Patent Title Rebel
           Hero to each Rebellious player.
         - All Stock Cards in the possession of Abiding Players are
           returned to the Deck, and the initiative of each Abiding
           Player is set to Gote.

Rule 1747/7 (Power=1)
Pardoning Lawlessness

      The Clerk of the Courts has the power to Pardon Fugitives from
      Justice that have been deregistered for Lawlessness.  The Clerk
      may not exercise this power more than once per Agoran month, and
      may not Pardon the same person twice in a given term of Office
      (although, if re-elected later, e may again Pardon that person).
      The Clerk of the Courts Pardons a Fugitive from Justice by
      publicly announcing e is doing so. Then the following events
      shall occur:

         i) The Clerk of the Courts shall expunge as many of the
            Fugitive's Blots as required to reduce eir Stain to one
            less than the threshold for Lawlessness, and notify the
            Herald of this action.

        ii) After the above step has been completed, the Fugitive may
            reregister as a Player.

       iii) The Pardoned Player shall then publish a Formal Apology
            for eir Lawlessness. The CotC may include a list of up to
            ten Prescribed Words in eir Pardon.

        iv) For three months after being Pardoned, the Pardoned Player
            may not perform any Progressive Actions except expunging
            Blots from eir record, unless e is Immaculate.

      This Rule takes precedence over any Rule governing Lawlessness,
      or when a deregistered Player may reregister.

The Speaker-Elect

      The Speaker-Elect is an office; its holder is usually the
      Speaker's successor.

      Whenever the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker, e ceases to be
      Speaker-Elect.  The Speaker can never hold the Office of
      Speaker-Elect, nor be the Electee to the Office of
      Speaker-Elect.  If the Speaker somehow becomes the Electee to
      the Office of Speaker-Elect, e is immediately removed from that

      A Tainted Speaker remains Speaker only until there is an Electee
      to the Office of Speaker-Elect, at which point, a Speaker
      Transition occurs.

      such.

      This Referendum must name the offending Speaker, and if that
      Player is Speaker upon passage of this Referendum, that Speaker
      is Tainted.

      For this Referendum the default procedure for Referenda is

      If there is ever no Electee for the Office of Speaker-Elect, the
      Office shall be held by the Active Player highest in the order
      of succession who has not publicly declined since there was last

      Speaker Transition is a process which commences at the time the
      Rules call for a Speaker Transition to occur, and which proceeds
      as follows:

      (i)   when the Speaker Transition commences, the Speaker loses
            all special rights and privileges that accrue to em as a
            result of being Speaker;

      (ii)  as soon as possible after the Speaker Transition
            commences, the Associate Director of Personnel shall
            publish a Notice of Speaker Transition, identifying the
            reason for the Transition and the Player who held the
            Office of Speaker-Elect at the time the Transition
            commenced;

      (iii) provided that the Notice of Speaker Transition is
            correct in its particulars, the posting of the Notice
            causes the Player identified in it to cease being the
            Speaker-Elect and to become the Speaker. This concludes
            the process of Speaker Transition.

Rule 1726/1 (Power=1)
The Guillotine

      There is a type of Application known as a Guillotine
      Application.  Such an Application is submitted by submitting it
      to the Assessor.  A Guillotine Application may specify when it
      is to take effect; if it does not do so, or specifies a time
      prior to its submission, it takes effect when submitted.  For a
      Guillotine Application to take effect:

      * it must state that it is a Guillotine Application;

      * it must clearly identify exactly one Proposal to which it
        applies;

      * that Proposal's Voting Period must be in progress;

      * the ratio of the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        bears to the number of Active Senators whose signatures it
        does not bear must exceed the Adoption Index of the Proposal;
        and

      * it must bear the signatures of at least two Senators.

      When a Guillotine Application takes effect, the Voting Period
      of the Proposal to which it applies immediately ends.  This Rule
      takes precedence over all other Rules governing the Voting
      Period of Proposals.

      A Senator is any Player who has been registered continuously for

      At any time during the Voting Period of an Issue which is not an
      Ordinary Proposal, the Speaker may make it a Senate Vote, by
      publicly stating so. An Issue is not a Senate Vote otherwise.

      Only Senators can Vote on Senate Votes.  When an Issue becomes a
      Senate Vote, all Votes cast on that Issue by non-Senators are
      cancelled.

Disinterested Proposals

      Interest is a stuck proposal switch with values interested and
      disinterested.

      A player may flip an undistributed proposal's interest to
      disinterested, without objection.

      When a proposal becomes disinterested, it becomes distributable,
      and its depth may not be flipped to undistributable while it
      remains disinterested.

Rule 1588/0 (Power=1)
Subordinate Legal Codes

      A Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) is a body of law organized under
      the Rules.  A body of law is a SLC only if it is granted that
      status by the Rules and it meets all other requirements in the
      Rules for being a SLC.

Precedence of SLCs

      Unless otherwise specified by the Rules, older SLCs take
      precedence over younger ones.  This ordering is based on the
      time the SLC is first created.

      This Rule does not in any way establish an order of precedence
      for the components, if any, within a given SLC.

Rule 1591/0 (Power=1)
Jurisdiction of SLCs

      A SLC has the power to constrain the actions of Players in
      the same manner as the Rules.  However, a SLC has power over
      only those Players within its Jurisdiction, as defined in the
      Rules authorizing that SLC.

      The Jurisdiction of a SLC must be specified by the Rules,
      either directly or indirectly.  If the Jurisdiction of a SLC
      might vary over the course of the existence of the SLC, the
      Rules must specify a Player who is required to maintain a record
      of which Players are within the Jurisdiction of that SLC.

Rule 1590/2 (Power=1)
Maintainer of SLCs

      For a SLC to be legally authorized, the Rules must specify a
      Player who is required to maintain a record of the content of
      that SLC; this Player is known as the Maintainer of that SLC.

      The Maintainer of a given SLC must provide a copy of it to any
      other Player who requests it, as soon as possible after the
      request is made.  If the SLC has changed between the time of the
      request and the time the Maintainer fulfills the request, the
      Maintainer must provide the SLC as it existed at the time of the
      request and must additionally document every change made to the
      SLC between the time of the request and the time of its
      fulfillment.

      The Maintainer of an SLC must also provide an updated copy of
      the SLC to all Players within its Jurisdiction as soon as
      possible after the SLC changes for any reason.

[CFJ 860: It is sufficient for the Rules to name an Officer as
 Maintainer of an SLC.]

      A SLC is permitted to define its own mechanisms for changing its
      own content, and any change to a SLC adopted in accordance with
      its own mechanisms is legal.

Contested Proposals

      (a) A null Proposal is a Proposal containing no provisions,
          i.e., one that does not propose any Rule Changes, or any
          other changes to the game state.

      (b) Any Player may make a null Proposal Distributable without
          payment of the usual Fee, provided that no other null
          Proposal in the current Agoran Month has been made
          Distributable under this provision.

      (c) The first null Proposal to be distributed in each Agoran
          Month is a Contested Proposal.

      (d) A Contested Proposal is Democratic.

      (e) Notwithstanding the prevailing Mode of Voting on Proposals,
          voting on a Contested Proposal is always Unrestricted. This
          Rule takes precedence over Rules that determine the
          permissible methods for casting votes on Proposals.

      (f) If a Contested Proposal fails Quorum, no Points are Awarded.

      (g) If a Contested Proposal achieves Quorum, but fails, each
          Player who voted against the Proposal and did not vote for
          it may be Awarded 10 Points.

      (h) If a Contested Proposal is adopted, each Player who voted
          for the Proposal and did not vote against it may be Awarded
          10 Points.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 2013/1 (Power=1)
Champion's Contests

      If no Champion's Contest exists, the Scorekeepor or the Speaker
      may, with 2 Support, name an existing Contest to be a Champion's
      Contest.  The namers are encouraged to select Contests that they
      feel would give the maximum enjoyment to Agorans as a whole, and
      give preference to Contests run by Players who were members of
      the most recently winning team.

      The Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest ceases to be a member
      of any team, rules to the contrary nonwithstanding.  If e ceases
      to be Contestmaster of a Champion's Contest, e shall be assigned
      to a team as if e were a new Player.

      Each Champion's Contest begins with zero awardable points, as
      tracked by the Scorekeepor.  At the beginning of each month, the
      Contest's awardable points are increased by the Champion's Grant
      contained in the Scorekeepor's Budget.

      A Champion's Contest Contestmaster may publish a Notice of
      Award, listing a positive number of Points to be awarded to a
      team or teams.  The posting must obey all regulations for such
      posting contained in the Contest's SLC, and award no more than
      the Contest's awardable points, to be valid.

      The effect of a valid Notice of Award is to increase the named
      teams' points as indicated, and decrease the Contest's awardable
      points by the same amount.

      When a Team Win occurs, any Champion's Contest ceases to be a
      Champion's Contest and loses all awardable points.

Rule 1929/8 (Power=1)
Points

      A Player's Score is a measure of that Player's unloserliness,
      measured in Points. The Score of each Player is at all times an
      integer. A Player who has not been Awarded or Penalized since
      the last Score Reset has a Score of zero Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Player to be Awarded Points (causing eir Score to be increased)
      or Penalized Points (causing eir Score to be decreased). If said
      event occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the
      Award or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in
      the affected Player's Score.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
         -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
         -- It must unambiguously describe the event
         -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
         -- It must be the first valid notification for that specific
            event

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is invalid and points do not change.

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the player may be penalized/awarded a number of
      points equal to the original award/penalty.

Rule 2053/2 (Power=1)
Team Points, Team Scores

      A Team Score is at all times an integer.  The Team Score of a
      Team is the total sum of all Points of all Players grouped into
      that Team, plus the Team's Team Points.

      A Team who has not been Awarded or Penalized since the last
      Score Reset has zero Team Points.

      The Rules may specify that certain events may cause a certain
      Team to be Awarded or Penalised Team Points. If said event
      occurs, then any Player may notify the Scorekeepor of the Award
      or Penalty. The Scorekeepor shall then note the change in the
      affected Team Points.

      Such a notification must meet the following requirements, else
      it is ineffective:
      -- It must be sent within 7 days of the event
      -- It must unambiguously describe the event
      -- It must indicate the Rule allowing the Award or Penalty
      -- It must be the first valid notification for that specific
         event

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is invalid and points do not change.

      If the event did not actually occur, and the notification is not
      challenged within 7 days for this reason, then the notification
      is valid and points change.  If the notification is challenged
      later, then the team may be penalized/awarded a number of points
      equal to the original award/penalty.

Rule 1986/7 (Power=2)
Role-Based Powers

      An action is a Progressive action if the rules so state.

      If an action is progressive, a Player (the Actor) may perform
      the action either:

      (a) with the Support of a number Players equal to one plus the
          number of times that actor has performed that action in the
          current week;
      (b) by paying a fee equal to the amount of Support required in
          (a);
      (c) if the number calculated in (a) is zero, by public
          announcement.

      A progressive action may be associated with a role if the rules
      so state.  If an progressive action is associated with a role,
      only players who hold that role may perform, or support
      performance of, that action.

      Rubberstamping a Proposal is a progressive action for Scribes.
      A Rubberstamped Proposal becomes Distributable.

      Absolving an entity is a progressive action for Acolytes.
      Absolving an entity expunges 1 Blot from that entity.

      Debating an Undistributed Proposal is a progressive Action for
      Politicians.  The effect of Debating a Proposal is to change its
      Chamber to one named by the Politician, provided it is legal for
      that Proposal to be in the named Chamber and the Proposal is not
      Sane.

Rule 1941/2 (Power=1)
Fees

      If the Rules associate a non-negative cost, price, charge, or
      fee with an action, that action is a fee-based action.  If the
      specified cost is not an integer, the actual fee is the next
      highest integer.

      To perform a fee-based action, a Player (the Actor) who is
      otherwise permitted to perform the action must announce that e
      is performing the action and announce that there is a fee for
      that action.  Upon said announcement, the action is performed,
      the Actor's kudos are decreased by the fee, and Agora's kudos
      are increased by the fee.

      Any Player (hereafter the challenger) may announce that the
      Actor possessed insufficient Honor (kudos) to perform the
      action, provided e issues eir challenge within 7 days of the
      attempted action.

      As soon as possible after such a challenge, the Herald shall
      confirm or deny whether the Actor possessed kudos equal to or
      greater than the fee at the time e attempted the action.  If the
      Actor in fact possessed insufficient honor, or the honor of the
      Actor cannot be determined by reasonable effort, the action
      shall be deemed to have not occurred and the kudos of the Actor
      (and Agora) shall be deemed to have not been changed by the fee.

      If a Player issues a challenge as above, but more than 7 days
      have passed since the attempted action, then the action shall be
      permitted to stand.  As soon as possible after a late challenge
      is issued, the Herald shall confirm or deny its correctness.
      But in this case the Fee shall be recorded even if the Actor is
      left with negative kudos.

Rule 1661/10 (Power=1)
The Right of Patronage

      A Speaker who is not Tainted has the Right of Patronage. This
      Right is the authority to, once a week, award the Boon Gold Star
      to a single Player who has not received this award within the
      preceding four weeks.  The Speaker must provide a reason along
      with the Notice of Award.

      Such awards are only permitted to recognize acts the Speaker
      believes to be of benefit to the Agora community, acts that the
      Speaker believes to exceed the call of duty, or acts that the
      Speaker believes to be of extreme sacrifice for the good of the
      Game.

Rule 1990/5 (Power=1)
Points Contests

      A Contest may be a Points Contest if its ACO specifically states
      that it is a Points Contest.  A Player may not be the
      Contestmaster of more than one Points Contest in a single Agoran
      month.

      The Players Points Limit and Points Per Player are as set in the
      Scorekeepor's Budget.

      Once during each month that starts while the Contest exists, a
      Points Contest's Contestmaster may post a single valid Notice of
      Award to the Public Forum, listing any number of the Contest's
      Contestants, and a listing a positive number of Points to be
      awarded to each Contestant on the list.  Different Contestants
      may be awarded different numbers of points in the same
      listing. The posting must obey all regulations for such posting
      contained in the Contest's SLC to be valid.

      The total Points listed to be awarded to all Contestants in each
      such monthly Notice may not exceed Points Per Player times the
      number of Players who were Contestants of the Contest at any
      time in the 14 days prior to the Notice.  If more points than
      this are listed the Notice is invalid.

      The total number of Points that a single Player may receive from
      all Points Contests in a single month may not exceed the Players
      Points Limit.  If a Points Contest Notice would bring a Player's
      total to more points than this than the Notice is invalid for
      that Player only.

      The posting of such a Notice of Award, if valid, is an event
      Awarding the listed Points to the listed Players.

Parliamentary Votes

      (a) The First Estate consists of all Players who are Acolytes,
          the Second Estate of all Players who are Politicians, and
          the Third Estate of all Players who are Scribes.

      (b) To count the votes on a parliamentary proposal, the Assessor
          shall first count as preliminary votes all communications
          from Players and their Executors that would have been legal
          votes on the proposal if it had been sane.

      (c) For each Estate, the Assessor shall then use the preliminary
          votes of the Players in that Estate to determine a voting
          index for the Estate on the Proposal. If the voting index is
          greater than or equal to the adoption index of the proposal,
          then the Estate is deemed to have cast 1 vote FOR the
          proposal; otherwise, the Estate is deemed to have cast one
          vote AGAINST the proposal. The Estates are deemed to have
          cast their votes a moment before the end of the voting
          period.

      (d) Quorum for parliamentary proposals is determined using
          preliminary votes, and is calculated as it would be for a
          democratic proposal.

      (e) Votes cannot be cast on parliamentary proposals except as
          described in this Rule.

Property
  This Category includes Rules concerning Property in general.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rule 1942/4 (Power=1)
Property

      A property is an entity which the rules permit to be possessed
      by another entity.  The term "possess" refers to the legal
      status of possessing a property; the terms "possessor" and
      "owner" are synonyms, as are "possess" and "own".  Individual
      properties may not be created or destroyed, or their ownership
      changed, except in accordance with the rules.

      Each property shall have a recordkeepor, which is a player
      required to maintain a record of who owns that property.  The
      Notary is the recordkeepor for each property that would
      otherwise have no recordkeepor.

      If one of the official duties of an officer is to be the
      recordkeepor of a property, then eir Weekly Report shall include
      this record and any changes thereto since the last posting of
      eir Report.

      If a category of properties ceases to exist, all debts of that
      property shall cease to exist.  The former recordkeepor of that
      property category must, as soon as possible after the category
      ceases to exist, publish entities' holdings of that category as
      they existed immediately before this destruction.

      If a Player destroys a category of property for which e is a
      debtor, e commits the Class-4 Crime of Writing Bad Checks.

Rule 1467/7 (Power=1)
Definition of a Currency

      A Currency is a category of entities established by the Rules.
      Each instance of a Currency is a Property. Instances of a given
      Currency are fungible. The size of a single instance, or
      "unit", of a given Currency is its Minimum Unit Quantity (MUQ).
      Individual units of a Currency cannot be divided; therefore,
      the final result of all computations involving numbers of units
      of Currency shall be rounded off to the nearest integral
      multiple of its MUQ.

      Unless otherwise specified, the MUQ of a Currency is one (1).

      Since units of Currency are fungible, it is not necessary for
      the Recordkeepor of a Currency to track the individual
      ownership of each unit; rather, it is sufficient to maintain a
      record of the total number of units possessed by each entity
      which possesses any number of units of that Currency.

      has Mint Authority if and only if granted it by the Rules.

      If the Mintor of a Currency ceases to exist, or ceases to have
      the authority to be a Mintor, then all units of that Currency
      are destroyed, and that Currency ceases to exist.  The
      Recordkeepor of that Currency shall publicly announce when
      this happens.

Rule 1722/2 (Power=1)
Creation of New Currencies

      A new Currency is created when an entity which has Mint
      Authority publicly posts a message stating that e is doing so,
      provided that also e states in that message the values of all
      properties which the Rules require of Currencies.  The Mintor of
      a Currency created in this way is the entity which created it,
      any specification to the contrary notwithstanding.  If the
      Recordkeepor of the Currency to be created is not the Executor
      of the Mintor, the proposed Recordkeepor must first consent to
      being its Recordkeepor before the Currency is created.

      A Currency is destroyed when the Mintor of that Currency
      publicly states that e is doing so, unless this destruction
      would be prohibited by the Rules.

      The Mintor of a Currency may not destroy that Currency if that
      Currency exists by virtue of being required to exist by the
      Rules.

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency created by the procedure in this
      Rule is changed when the Mintor of that Currency announces the
      change; but if the new Recordkeepor is not the Executor of the
      Mintor, the new Recordkeepor must first consent to being made
      Recordkeepor.

Rule 1471/2 (Power=1)
Creation and Destruction of Units of Currency

      New units of a Currency are created when the Mintor of that
      Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that Currency a notice
      that e is creating new units of that Currency, specifying the
      number of units that e is creating.  The newly created units are
      added to the Mintor's possessions.

      Units of Currency are destroyed when any entity which possesses
      units of that Currency transmits to the Recordkeepor of that
      Currency a notice that e is destroying units of that Currency,
      specifying the number of units that e is destroying.  An entity
      cannot destroy more units of a Currency than e possesses,
      however.  The units destroyed are removed from the possession of
      the entity performing the destruction.

Rule 1598/12 (Power=1)
Property Transfers

      (a) A Notice of Transfer is a message which sets forth the
          intent to transfer one or more Properties from one entity
          (the "transferor") to some other entity (the "transferee").

      (b) A valid Notice of Transfer must additionally:
          (1) specify one or more Properties all of which are owned by
              the transferor; and
          (2) be sent by the Executor of the transferor, or by a
              Limited Executor of the transferor with the authority to
              execute transfers on behalf of that entity with respect
              to all of the Properties involved.

      (c) A transfer of a Property occurs only when its Recordkeepor
          receives a valid Notice of Transfer.

      (d) The effect of a transfer of Properties is to cause the
          transferor to cease to possess the Properties transferred,
          and simultaneously to cause the transferee to possess them.

      (e) The Recordkeepor of a Property shall maintain a record of
          all transfers of that Property. E shall retain a record of
          each Notice of Transfer which e receives (whether valid or
          not) involving that Property. E shall retain this record of
          each Notice of Transfer for at least four weeks after its
          receipt.

      (f) If the transferor transfers Property to the transferee with
          the purpose of satisfying a debt, or of paying the Fee
          associated with performing an action, but the debt does not
          exist, or the action is not successfully performed, then the
          transferor may publicly demand the return of the Property.
          The effect of such a demand is to cause the transferee to
          incur a debt to the transferor for the Property transferred.

[In CFJ 1302, judged TRUE on 26 June 2001, the Judge agreed with the
 caller's argument that "a 'conditionally expressed Notice of
 Transfer' (that is, a message which appears to be a Notice of
 Transfer but with a condition attached), where a reasonable person
 would conclude that the sender of the purported Notice of Transfer
 did not possess, at the time e sent the purported Notice of Transfer,
 immediate knowledge as to whether the condition was true, does not
 express an 'intent to transfer one or more Properties' and as such is
 not a Notice of Transfer.  Rather, such a message expresses an intent
 to achieve a certain state of affairs which may or may not include a
 transfer, and as such fails to set forth the requisite intent
 required by Rule 1598."]

[CFJ 1337, judged 8 January 2002, established that the use of a
 locution like 'I transfer all my Papyri (3.15) to the Bank' is
 acceptable and valid as a Notice of Transfer, because it clearly
 specifies the Properties being transferred.]

Rule 1596/9 (Power=1)
Debt

      (a) A "debt" is an obligation arising under the Rules for one
          entity (the "debtor") to make a transfer of one or more
          Properties to some other entity (the "creditor").

      (b) No debt shall be enforceable unless a notice sufficient to
          inform the debtor of the debt has been sent to the debtor.
          If a Rule requires that a public notice of a debt be posted,
          the debt is not enforceable until and unless that notice is
          posted.

      (c) A debt is satisfied when the debtor has transferred (or is
          deemed to have transferred) all the Properties named to the
          creditor (either as a single transfer or as the aggregate of
          multiple transfers).

      (d) A debt is forgiven when the creditor of a debt sends a
          notice to the debtor that e is forgiving the
          debt. Forgiveness may be for the entire debt or for any part
          thereof. The effect of forgiving a debt is to relieve the
          debtor of the obligation arising from that part of the debt
          which has been forgiven to transfer Property to the
          creditor.

      (e) If two entities are each others' debtor, and all or part of
          their debts to each other are for the same quantity (equal
          portions) of the same fungible Property, then a public
          announcement of this mutual debt by either entity will have
          the effect of satisfying the equal portions of the debts for
          both debtors as in (c) above.

Rule 1599/9 (Power=1)
Overdue Debts

      (a) Provided that e has not already done so, the Executor of the
          creditor of any unsatisfied debt may demand that the debtor
          satisfy that debt, by notifying the debtor of the demand.

      (b) The debtor shall have seven days from the time of the
          notification to satisfy the debt, except that if the debtor
          is not active at the time the demand is sent, the debtor
          shall instead have seven days from the time e becomes active
          to satisfy the debt. Time during which a debt is disputed is
          not counted for the purposes of this Rule.

      (c) A debt not satisfied within the time allowed by this Rule
          becomes delinquent when that time elapses. It ceases to be
          delinquent when it is satisfied.

      (d) Any Player who is the Prime Executor of an entity with
          respect to the satisfaction of a debt owed by that entity
          commits the Class 1 Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness
          when that debt first becomes delinquent, and commits it
          again every seven days thereafter for as long as the debt
          remains delinquent. This Infraction may be reported by the
          creditor of the delinquent debt.

Rule 1853/10 (Power=1)
Levying Taxes

      The Recordkeepor of a Currency ("the taxing authority") may levy
      a tax on that Currency only as follows:

      (A) First, the taxing authority publically issues an
          announcement of intent to levy a tax; second, at a later
          point, the taxing authority publically issues a tax notice
          (the levy).

      (B) To be valid, both the notice of intent to levy a tax, and
          the tax notice itself, must specify the elements of the tax,
          viz., the currency being taxed, the tax rate expressed as a
          percentage of holdings (which may not exceed 50%), and any
          exemptions.

      (C) The tax notice must be published between seven and fourteen
          days after the time of the announcement of the intent to
          issue the levy, and must be at least 30 days after the last
          valid tax notice published for that Currency.  The
          announcement of intent to issue the levy may not take place
          while another attempt to levy a tax on that Currency is
          pending under the authority of this Rule.

      (D) The tax may include exemptions on a fixed amount of the
          holdings of every taxable entity, provided that:
           (i) All Players are exempt identical amounts,
          (ii) All Non-players are exempt identical amounts,
         (iii) The Non-players' exemption is less than or equal to
               the Players' exemption.

      (E) The tax debt for each taxable entity is calculated on the
          basis of the entity's holdings at the time of the
          publication of the notice of intent. Any holdings exempt
          from the tax are exempted, and the tax is applied to the
          remainder at the specified tax rate.

      (F) A tax notice must also indicate the currency holdings of
          each taxable entity at the time of the publication of the
          notice of intent to levy a tax, and the tax debt incurred by
          each such entity.  Any error in the calculation of holdings
          or tax debts does not invalidate the tax notice with respect
          to the other taxable entities mentioned in it.

      (G) Upon the publication of a valid tax notice, each taxable
          entity incurs a debt to the Mintor of the Currency equal to
          eir tax debt.

      (H) All entities are taxable, except for:
          (i) rebellious players who were rebellious at the time the
              intent to levy was published, and
         (ii) entities explicitly specified by the rule authorizing
              the levy as non-taxable for that levy.

      Other Rules may specify conditions under which an entity other
      than the recordkeepor of a currency may be a taxing authority
      for the purposes of this Rule.

Rule 1887/19 (Power=1)
Auctions and the Default Auction Procedure

      When an Auction is to be held and the procedure is not
      specified, the Auctioneer may select a rules-defined Auction
      Procedure. If e does not specify which procedure is to be used,
      the Default Auction Procedure shall be used.

      The Default Auction Procedure is as follows:

      (a) Auctioneer: the Auctioneer is the Player who initiates the
          Auction, and is responsible for collecting bids and
          announcing the result of the Auction. If the Rules require
          (or permit) an Auction to be initiated, but do not specify
          which Player shall initiate it, then the Speaker shall (or
          may) initiate it.

      (b) Bidders: every active Player may bid in an Auction;
          non-active Players may not bid. Activity is measured at the
          time a Player sends eir bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. The Rule providing for a particular
          Auction must specify the currency to be used, or the Auction
          cannot take place.

      (d) Number of lots: each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
          identical lots of identical items, which must all be owned
          by the same entity. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of lots up for bid in the Auction.

      (e) Start of Auction: the Auction begins when the first
          announcement that an Auction has begun is made by a Player
          authorized to initiate the Auction. The announcement must
          contain:
          (1) the identity of the Auctioneer;
          (2) the Auction Currency;
          (3) the number of items being Auctioned; and
          (4) the value of the Starting Bid.

      (f) Errors in initiating Auctions: if one of the required
          elements is missing from the announcement initiating the
          Auction, or is incorrect, then the Auctioneer may let the
          Auction stand Without 2 Objections. If the Auction stands,
          then the announcement initiating the Auction is deemed to
          have been legal and correct for the purposes of the
          Rules. If the Auction does not stand, it is deemed not to
          have occurred.

      (g) Starting Bid: the Starting Bid is the minimum possible value
          of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting Bid is
          equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (h) Bidding: a bid is a public message from a bidder identifying
          the Auction e is bidding in, and specifying the amount of
          eir bid. Each bidder may make as many bids as e likes during
          the Auction.  A bid is only valid if it satisfies the
          following conditions:
          (1) it is made after the start of the Auction, and before
              its end;
          (2) the amount of the bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the
              Auction Currency; and
          (3) the amount of the bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (i) Cancelling bids: a bidder may cancel eir bid while the
          Auction is in progress by publically identifying the bid to
          be cancelled.

      (j) End of Auction: the Auction ends if any of the following
          occur:
          (1) one week has passed from the start of the Auction, and
              no bids have been made; or
          (2) a bid has been made in the Auction, and 72 hours have
              passed without there being a change in the N highest
              bids in the Auction; or
          (3) 14 days have passed since the Auction began.

      (k) Winning bids: when the Auction ends, the winning bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid bids in the Auction (or all
          valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled bids). Ties shall be broken in favor of earlier-
          submitted bids. If there were no bids in the Auction, then
          the Auction has no winner.

      (l) Final Auction Price: the Final Auction Price is either:
          (1) the amount of the Nth highest bid, if there were N or
              more valid uncancelled bids in the auction; or
          (2) the Starting Bid, if there were greater than zero but
              fewer than N valid uncancelled bids.

      (m) Billing for winning bids: as soon as possible after the end
          of the Auction, the Auctioneer shall announce the winning
          bids and issue to each winning bidder a separate bill for
          each of eir winning bids.

      (n) Defaulting: a winning bidder has a week from the time e is
          billed by the Auctioneer for a winning bid e made to satisfy
          the debt arising from that bid. If e does not do so, e
          commits the Class 2 Infraction of Defaulting (reportable by
          the Auctioneer), and thereafter loses eir right to purchase
          the Auctioned item by paying the debt arising from that
          bid. As soon as possible after a winning bidder defaults on
          a bid, the Auctioneer shall Order the owner of the items
          being Auctioned to forgive the unsatisfied debt arising from
          the bid.

      (o) Unless specified otherwise, the owner of the Auctioned items
          shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to the
          winning bidder when the bill for that lot is paid.

      Interest is a stuck proposal switch with values interested and
      disinterested.

      A player may flip an undistributed proposal's interest to
      disinterested, without objection.

      When a proposal becomes disinterested, it becomes distributable,
      and its depth may not be flipped to undistributable while it
      remains disinterested.

Rule 1552/3 (Power=1)
d1827 25
a1851 35
      In order for an Official Document to be valid for the purpose of
      a Ratification, it must satisfy all the following criteria at
      the time the Proposal which would Ratify it is Proposed:

           i) The Rules require some specific Player to produce and/or
              maintain the document.
          ii) The Rules required it to be published.  (A requirement
              that it be sent to all Players fulfills this criterion.)
         iii) It is not currently subject to a Claim of Error. (COE)
          iv) It is not currently subject to a pending Call for
              Judgement (CFJ), or a pending Appeal of a CFJ.
           v) The information within the Document has not been
              superseded by a subsequent Document.
          vi) The Document is not the Ruleset. The Ruleset is
              specifically excluded from Ratification.

      Further, a Document can become invalid during the Voting Period
      of a Proposal which would Ratify it if any of the following
      occurs:

           i) The Document is superseded by a subsequent Document
              which contradicts the information in the prior Document.
              This does not apply if there is a COE alleging the
              contradiction is an error, and the error is admitted
              before the end of the Proposal's Voting Period.
          ii) A COE is made on the Document, and the COE has not been
              denied before the end of the Proposal's Voting
              Period.
         iii) The Document becomes subject to a pending CFJ or a
              pending appeal of a CFJ.

       If, during the Voting Period of a Proposal to Ratify a
       Document, another Document is issued that does not contradict
       the prior Document, it does not alter the validity of the prior
       Document.

Spelling, Quoting, and Terminology
d189 2
a190 11
      Differences in spelling, grammar, or dialect, or the
      substitution of a word or phrase by a synonym or abbreviation,
      are inconsequential in all forms of Nomic communication, as long
      as there is no ambiguity in meaning.  A Player shall not be
      penalised for accurately quoting a Rule, Proposal, Statement,
      Judgement, the words of another Player, or other reference.

      Except when the Rules explicitly state otherwise, any
      mathematical term in the Rules shall be construed to have its
      standard mathematical meaning.  In particular, "number" shall
      mean "real number".

      Weeks, months, quarters and years are epochs.  The corresponding
      Agoran epochs, which constitute the four types of Agoran epochs,
      are Agoran weeks, Agoran months, Agoran quarters, and Agoran
      years, respectively.

      Agoran weeks begin at midnight GMT on Monday.  Agoran months
      begin at midnight GMT on the first day of each Gregorian month.
      Agoran quarters begin when the Agoran months of January, April,
      July, and October begin.  Agoran years begin when the Agoran
      month of January begins.  An Agoran epoch lasts until the next
      Agoran epoch of the same type begins.

      Except in this Rule, when the Rules refer to an epoch, they
      shall be interpreted to refer to the corresponding Agoran epoch.

      Automatic events that happen weekly, monthly, quarterly, or
      yearly happen at the beginning of the corresponding Agoran
      epoch.  Any activity that must be performed weekly, monthly,
      quarterly, or yearly must be performed at least once during each
      corresponding Agoran epoch.

Rule 112/4 (Power=3)
Ways to Win and Preclusions Thereof

      A Player is eligible to Win the Game while e meets at least one
      Win Condition, and does not meet any Win-Preventing Conditions.

      Any Player may publish a Notice of Victory that lists all
      Players eligible to Win the Game, and (for each listed Player)
      identifies at least one Win Condition met by that Player.  If
      this information is accurate, then the listed Players Win the
      Game.

      This is the only way to Win the Game.  If a Player would
      otherwise Win the Game due to other Rules, then e instead meets
      a Win Condition for one week (and may Win the Game as described
      above).

      conditions:

      1. E possesses less than four times the Basic Officer Salary of
         Stems.
      2. E does not possess any Voting Entitlement.s

      A player who has been Sanctimonious continuously for the most
      recent week becomes a Monk by notifying the Registrar that e
      becomes a Monk.  Whenever a Monk has not satisfied all
      conditions for Sanctimony for at least 48 hours, any player may
      report this to the Registrar.  On the Registrar's public
      confirmation of this report, the Monk ceases to be a Monk.

Looting Auctions

      As soon as possible after a player becomes a Dissolute, the

      the Corpse of the Dissolute.  Once a Looting Auction begins, the
      Notary may not transfer property on behalf of the Dissolute
      until either the Auction ends without any winning bids or the
      winning bidder defaults on eir bid or loses eir privilege to
      Loot the Corpse of that Dissolute.

      Looting Auctions shall follow the default procedure for Auctions
      with the following modifications:

      (1) The Auction Currency shall be Indulgences.
      (2) The Starting Price shall be the number of Blots the
          Dissolute had when e became a Dissolute, or one Indulgence
          if the Dissolute was Immaculate.
      (3) The Auction shall be for a temporary privilege, not for an
          item, and so no debt of items to the winning Bidder when eir
          bill is paid shall be incurred.

      If there are no winning bids for the privilege of Looting the
      Corpse of that Dissolute, the Notary must, as soon as possible
      after the end of the Looting Auction, transfer all the
      Dissolute's property to the Bank.

      When the winning bidder pays eir bill from the Looting Auction,
      e gains the privilege of Looting the Corpse of that Dissolute; e
      becomes a Limited Executor of the Dissolute, with the authority
      to transfer property from the Dissolute to emself.  One week
      after e gains this privilege, e loses it, and ceases to be a
      Limited Executor of the Dissolute.  If the Dissolute still has
      property after the winning bidder loses this privilege, the
      Notary must transfer the Dissolute's remaining property to the
      Bank as soon as possible afterward.

      (b) Start of Raffle: the Raffle begins when the first
          announcement that a Raffle has begun is made by a Player
          authorized to initiate the Raffle. The announcement must
          contain:
          (1) the identity of the Riff-Raff;
          (2) the Raffle Currency;
          (3) the number of items, N, being Raffled; and

          to the MUQ of the Raffle Currency.

      (d) Buying tickets: each active Player may buy tickets in the
          Raffle; non-active Players may not buy tickets. An entrant
          buys a ticket by paying a Fee equal to the Ticket Price to
          the Bank, provided that the purchase is not made before the

          as many tickets as e likes during the Raffle.

      (e) End of Raffle: the Raffle ends if any of the following
          occur:

              tickets have been purchased; or
          (2) a ticket has been purchased in the Raffle, and 72 hours
              have passed without another ticket being purchased in

          (3) 14 days have passed since the Raffle began.

      (f) Winning tickets: When the Raffle ends, the Riff-Raff shall
          randomly determine N valid Raffle tickets to be winning
          tickets. Each Raffle ticket has one chance to win, and
          multiple Raffle tickets bought by the same entrant may win.
          If there were less than N valid Raffle tickets, then all
          valid Raffle tickets are winning tickets.

      (g) Announcing winners: as soon as possible after the end of the
          Raffle, the Riff-Raff shall announce the winning tickets.
          Upon this announcement, the owner of the Auctioned items
          shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to each
          winning entrant for each of eir winning tickets.

      (h) Riff-Raff's Gratuity: within a week after the end of the
          Raffle, the Riff-Raff may pay out to emself the Ticket Price
          in the Raffle Currency if:
          (1) the Raffle had at least three separate winning entrants,

Rule 2012/2 (Power=1)
Single-Bid Auctions

      There is a type of auction called a single-bid auction. The
      procedure for conducting a single-bid auction is the same as
      that used in the default auction procedure, with the following
      additions and exceptions:

      (a) Bid inflation factor: As part of any correct and legal
          announcement that a single-bid auction is commencing, the
          Auctioneer must announce the value of the bid inflation
          factor for the auction, a real number between 0 and 1
          inclusive.

      (b) Making bids: each player eligible to bid in the auction is
          permitted to make only one bid, called the initial bid.  Any
          bids made by a player after eir initial bid in the auction
          are invalid.  A player who cancels eir bid is ineligible to
          make further bids in the auction.  All bids must be made
          publically.

      (c) Value of bids: at each midnight GMT during the auction, the
          value of each valid, uncancelled bid remaining in the
          auction is increased by an amount equal to the bid inflation
          factor multiplied by the initial bid.

      (d) End of auction: the auction ends if any of the following
          occur:

          (1) one week has passed from the start of the auction, and
              no bids have been made; or

          (2) a bid has been made in the auction, and there has been
              no change in the N highest initial bids for 72 hours; or

          (3) fourteen days have passed since the Auction began.

      (e) Final auction price: for the purposes of determining the
          winner(s) of the auction, the value of each bid as
          calculated in (c) above is used. However, the debt incurred
          by a winner of the auction is equal to the Nth highest
          winning initial bid, where N is the number of items being
          auctioned, or to the starting bid, if there were fewer than
          N bids.

          Authority.  The Bank is the Mintor of each Bank Currency.
          The Bank may transfer Property in its possession to other
          entities only to satisfy its debts.

      (b) The Treasuror is the Executor of the Bank.  Each
          Recordkeepor of each Bank Currency is a Limited Executor of
          the Bank, and is empowered to make transfers of that
          Currency from the Bank.

      (c) Each Recordkeepor of each Bank Currency is the Prime
          Executor of the Bank with respect to debts denominated in
          that Currency. The Treasuror is the Prime Executor of the
          Bank with respect to all other actions that the Bank is
          required to perform.

      (d) As soon as possible after the Bank incurs a debt to any
          other entity, the Bank shall either satisfy that debt by
          transferring appropriate Properties to the creditor, or
          dispute the debt by whatever means are appropriate in the
          situation.

      (e) The Bank is permitted to forgive debts owed to it, in whole
          or in part:

Rule 1479/6 (Power=1)
Definition of "Pay Out" and "Bill"

      (a) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to pay out one or more
          Properties to some entity, the Bank shall incur a debt to
          that entity for those Properties, and the named Player
          shall, as soon as possible, post a public notice of the
          debt. The Player is relieved of this obligation if the debt
          is satisfied before the public notice is posted.

      (b) If a Rule explicitly permits a Player to pay out one or more
          Properties to some entity, but does not require em to do so,
          then the Bank shall incur a debt to that entity for those
          Properties when the Player posts a public notice of the
          debt.

      (c) Whenever a Rule requires a Player to bill an entity for one
          or more Properties, that entity shall incur a debt to the
          Bank for those Properties, and the named Player shall, as
          soon as possible, post a public notice of the debt. The
          Player is relieved of this obligation if the bill is paid
          before the public notice is posted.

CFJ 1301 (Judged TRUE, 13 June 2001): "Rule 1479 should be interpreted
 such that an Order, which requires a Player to pay out one or more
 Properties to some entity, and which is valid and proper under the
 Rules, causes the Bank to incur one or more debts to the named
 entity."

Stems Weather

      As soon as possible after the beginning of each month, the
      Treasuror shall randomly Determine the Weather for the month.
      The Weather can be one of either Foul, Fair, or Plenty, and
      shall be determined as follows:

        - Let FOUL be the number of Stems owned by the Bank,
          multiplied by the Foul Weather Factor as set in the
          Treasuror's Budget, and then rounded up to the nearest
          integer.

          excluding the Bank.
        - Let SAME and FAIR both be the sum of FOUL and PLENTY,
          divided by 4, rounding up to the nearest integer.
        - Let TOTAL by the sum of FOUL, PLENTY, SAME, and FAIR.

               Destroyed. If this value is greater than the number of
               Stems in the Possession of the Bank, all the Stems in
               the Possession of the Bank shall be Destroyed instead.
           (b) A number of Stems shall be Created in the Bank's
               Possession, equal to the number Destroyed in (a) above
               multiplied by:
                    0.50 if the Weather is Foul;
                    1.00 if the Weather is Fair;

Rule 1946/9 (Power=1)
Distribution of Voting Entitlements

      (a) The Ideal Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (IVECL) is
          equal to the number of registered Players multiplied by the
          Voting Entitlements per Player as set in the Assessor's
          Budget.

      (b) The Actual Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (AVECL) is
          the total number of Voting Entitlements owned by entities
          other than the Bank, augmented by the total number of Voting
          Entitlements owned by the Bank which either:
          (1) are already being Auctioned by the Bank in prior Voting
              Entitlement Auctions that have not yet concluded; or
          (2) have been auctioned in prior Voting Entitlement Auctions
              that have concluded, but where the debts arising from
              Winning Bids have neither been paid nor defaulted upon;
              or
          (3) have been Auctioned in prior Voting Entitlement Auctions
              that have concluded, and the debts arising from the
              Winning Bids have been paid, but the Voting Entitlements
              have not been transferred to the Winning Bidders.

      (c) The Voting Entitlement Surplus is the difference between the
          IVECL and the AVECL; if the AVECL is greater than the IVECL,

Distribution of Indulgences

      (a) The Ideal Indulgence Circulation Level (IICL) is equal to
          the number of Players plus the total Stain of all Players.

      (b) The Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) is the total
          number of Indulgences owned by entities other than the Bank,
          augmented by the total number of Indulgences owned by the
          Bank which either:

          (1) are already being Auctioned by the Bank in prior
              Indulgence Auctions that have not yet concluded; or
          (2) have been auctioned in prior Indulgence Auctions that
              have concluded, but where the debts arising from Winning
              Bids have neither been paid nor defaulted upon; or
          (3) have been Auctioned in prior Indulgence Auctions that
              have concluded, and the debts arising from the Winning
              Bids have been paid, but the Indulgences have not been
              transferred to the Winning Bidders.

      (c) The Indulgence Surplus is the difference between the IICL
          and the AICL; if the AICL is greater than the IICL, the
          Indulgence Surplus is zero.

      (d) If the Indulgence Surplus is positive at the beginning of
          the month, the Herald shall as soon as possible auction off
          the surplus Indulgences. The items to be auctioned are
          individual Indulgences; the number of items is equal to the
          Indulgence Surplus, rounded down to the nearest integer.
          The Auctioneer shall be the Herald, and the Auction shall be
          conducted in Stems.

      (e) The Monthly Bank Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of
          Indulgences transferred from other entities to the Bank
          during a given Nomic Month, less the number of Indulgences
          transferred from the Bank to other entities during that same
          Nomic Month.

      (f) If the Indulgence Surplus is less than one at the beginning
          of the month, the Herald may still conduct an Indulgence
          auction, but only if e initiates it within one week after
          the beginning of the month. The items to be auctioned are
          individual Indulgences; the number of items is chosen by the
          Herald, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of half the MBIG,
          rounded down to the nearest integer. The Auctioneer shall be
          the Herald, and the Auction shall be conducted in Stems.

The Land of Arcadia

      Arcadia is a land entirely defined by the Arcadian Map (the
      Map).  The Map is a record kept by the Office of the Mapkeepor.

      The Map divides Arcadia into a finite, discrete number of Units
      of Land, or simply Land.  Each Unit of Land is a unique instance
      of nonfungible Property specified by a pair of integers known as
      its Latitude and Longitude.

      Every unique pair of integers within the limits defined in the
      Rules for Latitude and Longitude signifies an existent Unit of
      Land.  No other Units of Land may exist.  Units of Land may only
      be created or destroyed by changing the limits of Latitude and
      Longitude defined in the Rules.

      All values for Latitude must lie between -9 and +9, inclusive.
      All values for Longitude must lie between -9 and +9, inclusive.

      The Total Land Area of Arcadia is the number of existent Units
      of Land defined by permissible Latitude and Longitude pairs.

Rule 1994/0 (Power=2)
Ownership of Land

      Any existent Land for which ownership has not been explicitly
      changed belongs to an entity known as the Land Bureau (the
      Bureau).

      Land belonging to the Bureau is called Unclaimed Land.  Land
      belonging to the Bank is called Public Land.  Land belonging to
      any other entity is called Private Land.  A Unit of Land for
      which a debt exists is considered to be In Escrow.

      The Mapkeepor is the Executor of the Land Bureau.  The Mapkeepor
      is also a Limited Executor of the Bank, with the authority to
      satisfy debts of Land owed by the Bank to its creditors, and the
      authority to demand the payment of Land owed to the Bank by its
      debtors.

      The transfer of Unclaimed or Public Land to any entity must be
      specifically permitted by the Rules, or be performed by the
      explicit action of an instrument of Power 2 or greater, to be an
      authorized Transfer.

      Private Land may be transferred from its owner to any other
      entity by the owner's Executor.  Any other transfer of Private
      Land must be performed by the explicit Action of an instrument
      of Power 2 or greater to be an authorized transfer.

Land Types

      Each Unit of Land shall have a single Land Type.  Each Unit of
      Land that has a Land Type shall have either zero or one Land
      Subtypes.  The Land Type or Subtype of a Unit may only be
      changed as specifically permitted by the Rules, or by an
      instrument of Power 2 or greater.

      The phrase "Units of X", where X is a Land Type (or Subtype)
      defined by the Rules, shall be considered a synonym for "Units
      of Land that have Land Type (or Subtype) X".

      When existent Land has not had its Type changed as explicitly
      permitted by the Rules, or has a Type that is not currently
      defined by the Rules, it shall be considered to have the Land
      Type of Aether.  Rules to the contrary nonwithstanding, Units of
      Aether may not be transferred from the Bureau, or owned by any
      entity other than the Bureau.  If Private or Public Land becomes
      Aether it shall be transferred to the Bureau as soon as
      possible.

      When existent Land has not had its Subtype changed as explicitly
      permitted by the Rules, or has a Subtype that is not currently
      defined by the Rules as permissible for its Land Type, it shall
      be considered to have no Subtype.

Rule 2003/11 (Power=1)
Actions in Arcadia

      Every week, the number of Actions Units an entity may expend to
      perform actions in the Land of Arcadia is as follows,

      - If the entity is a Player, 10, minus 1 for every 5 Blots in
        the Player's Stain as recorded in the most recent Herald's
        report before the week started, plus 1 for every unit of Land
        with Gote owned by the Player at the start of the week.

      - All other entities zero.

      Action Units are not transferable, and do not persist from one
      week to the next.

      An entity may expend Action Units to carry out an action in
      Arcadia by notifying the Mapkeepor of the specifics of the act.
      So long as e does not spend more than eir allotted number of
      Action Units, e may make as many actions e wishes in a single
      week.

      When an act specifies an alternating Land Type, the Land Type
      chosen will be based upon the Land Type used as the previous
      alternating Land Type, so that consecutive alternating Land
      Types alternate between Black and White. As soon as possible
      after a Player notifies the Mapkeepor of an act that specifies
      an alternating Land Type, the Mapkeepor must announce which Land
      Type was used for that act.

      Players may expend:

      * 2 Action Units to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit
        if their Land Types are the same and the destination is not
        Aether.

      * 5 Action Units to move from one Land Unit to an adjacent Unit
        if their Land Types differ and the destination is not Aether;

      Any entity may expend:

      * 5 Action Units to set Land Type of a Land Unit which e owns to
        any Land Type other than Aether, whether or not e is located
        at that Land Unit.

      * 5 Action Units to set the Land Type of a random Land Unit that
        is adjacent to the Entity's current location, is of type
        Aether, and is owned by the Land Bureau, to an alternating
        Land Type.  The Mapkeepor will make the random determination.
        This action has no effect if there are no qualifying Land
        Units.  As soon as possible after a Player notifies the
        Mapkeepor of this move, the Mapkeepor must announce which Land
        Unit, if any, is changed by this action.  The change occurs at
        the time of the first legal announcement from the Mapkeepor
        declaring which Land Unit's Land Type has changed.

      * 10 Action Units to set the Land Type of the Entity's current
        location to any Land Type of eir choice other than Aether, if
        and only if the Unit is owned by the Land Bureau.

      * 10 Action Units to set the Land Type of any Land Unit that is
        of type Aether to an alternating Land Type.

      Unless explicitly permitted by other Rules, all other actions
      and moves in Arcadia are invalid.

      There shall be a separate Auction for each Unit of Land under
      consideration.  These Auctions shall be conducted concurrently.
      For each of these Auctions:
        * The item to be Auctioned is the piece of Land in question.
        * The Procedure to be used is the Vickrey Auction.
        * The Default Auction Currency shall be Indulgences; however,

Rule 2005/2 (Power=1)
Tolls

      An Entity who owns Land may impose a Toll on any (currently
      un-Tolled) piece of Land e owns.  To do so, e must pay a Fee of
      0.2 Indulgences and publicly announce that e is imposing a
      Toll, clearly and unambiguously identifying the Unit of Land in
      question, as well as the amount of the Toll for that Unit of
      Land.

      A Toll is a number of VEs, Indulgences, or Papyri.  No Unit of
      Land may have a Toll in other currencies, or in more than one of
      these currencies.  No Toll shall be greater than 200 times the
      MUQ of the currency in which it is denominated.  If an entity
      (the Tollee) Moves into a Unit of Land which is at the time
      owned by another Entity (the Toller), and for which there is at
      the time a Toll established, e (the Tollee) is said to be In
      Toll to the Unit of Land in question, for the amount of the Toll
      on that unit of land (at the time of the Move)

      The owner (Toller) of a Unit of Land may notify the Mapkeepor
      that e believes an entity has been In Toll to a Unit of Land
      owned by em; to do so, e submits a Notification of Toll, which
      must unambiguously describe the Unit of Land in question, the
      amount of the Toll, and the Entity (alleged Tollee) in question.
      The alleged Move must have occurred within the past week.  A
      Entity may submit only one such Notification for a given Unit of
      Land in a single week, and may not submit substantially the same
      Notification two weeks in a row.  Any Notification of Toll
      contrary to this Rule is invalid and shall be discarded.

      If, in the Mapkeepor's determination, the alleged Tollee was in
      fact, in the week before the Notification, In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, the Mapkeepor
      shall confirm the Toll by publicly informing the Tollee and the
      Toller.  The Tollee then incurs to the Toller a debt equal to
      the Toll specified in the Notification.  If, in the Mapkeepor's
      determination, the alleged Tollee was not In Toll to the
      specified Unit of Land for the specified amount, e shall deny
      the Notification by informing the Toller of eir determination.

      If the Mapkeepor fails to respond to a valid Notification of
      Toll, e commits the Class 2 Crime of Looking the Other Way.  If

Rule 2022/5 (Power=1)
Sente and Gote

      On the fifteenth of each Agoran Month, the following actions
      occur in sequence, and these changes must be reported by the
      Mapkeepor as soon as possible after they occur:

         (i) Every Land Unit, excluding (0, 0), that is not directly
             connected to a unit of Aether, and is not connected by
             its own type to a unit of Aether, shall be transformed to
             Aether.

        (ii) Any entities whose locations are on land units so
             transformed shall have their locations set to 0,0.

       (iii) If any land unit so transformed is not property of the
             Land Bureau, it becomes property of the Land Bureau.

        (iv) If there are more Land Units of a single defined Land
             Type, Aether excepted, then there are of all other Land
             Types combined (other than Aether), then all Land Units
             of that majority Type are said to have Sente.  Land Units
             of all other defined Types are said to have Gote.

         (v) the Mapkeepor shall Pay Out:
             (a) an amount of Stems equal to the Minimum Income times
                 the Basic Officer's Salary to all Players whose
                 location has Sente;
             (b) to the owner of any Land Unit that has Sente and is
                 not owned by the Bank or the Land Bureau:
                     * if the Weather is Plenty, 3 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Fair, 2 Stems for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;
                     * if the Weather is Foul, 1 Stem for each 5
                       Land Units with Sente that e owns;

      Sente and Gote shall only be changed as defined by this Rule, on
      the fifteenth of each Agoran Month.

Rule 2046/0 (Power=1)
Q*Bert (tm)

      Q*Bert (tm) is an entity in Arcadia.  Q*Bert moves one space per
      week, according to the following procedure:

      Q*Bert moves one space in a random direction, but not to the
      space it last moved from.  Q*Bert is permitted to move to an
      undefined destination or to Aether.  If Q*Bert moves to an
      undefined destination, its location becomes undefined, and the
      next week it will move to (0,0).

      Normally, Q*Bert moves in a diagonal direction.  If Q*Bert ends
      its diagonal movement at a location that another entity ends eir
      movement at for that week, then in the following week Q*Bert
      will say "@@!#?@@!" and move in a random orthogonal direction.

      Q*Bert has a color, which is a defined Land Type other than
      Aether and that does not have Sente.  When Q*Bert moves to a
      space, it changes the Land Type of that space.  If the current
      Type is not the same as Q*Bert's color, Q*Bert changes that
      space's type to its color.  Otherwise, Q*Bert changes that
      space's type to the Land Type that currently has Sente.

      The Mapkeepor is a Limited Executor of Q*Bert, and its Prime
      Executor for its movement in Arcadia.  The Mapkeepor is to make
      the random determination of Q*Bert's movement direction and
      publish Q*Bert's movement and its effect as soon as possible
      after the start of the Agoran week.

      Upon the Mapkeepor's report that Q*Bert's color has Sente,
      Q*Bert's color becomes a random Land Type other than Aether or
      the old color.  The Mapkeepor will make this random
      determination.

      If a Player Wins the Game by Bearing the Patent Title
      SemiGenius, The Winner's Stipend shall be set equal to
      proportion, rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1, of Active
      Players (out of total number of Active Players at the time of
      the Win) that were Contestants, at any time since the most
      recent previous Win, in the Champion's Contest that Awarded that
      Patent Title.

      In this case, the Scorekeepor shall pay out the Champion's
      Pension, equal to this new Winner's Stipend times the BOS, to
      the Contestmaster who awarded the Patent Title.

      If a Player Wins the Game by any other Win Condition, the
      Winner's Stipend shall be set to 0.5, and no Champion's Pension
      shall be awarded.

      If a Player bears the Patent Title Current Champion at the
      beginning of four consecutive Agoran months without a Win
      occuring, then at the beginning each month thereafter, until a
      Win occurs, the Scorekeepor shall Bill the Player an amount
      equal to twice the current Winner's Stipend times the BOS.

Groups

      A Group is an Organization with an associated SLC called its
      Ordinances. The Administrator for each Group is that Group's
      Ordinancekeepor, the Executor is its Vizier, and the set of
      Players within the Jurisdiction of its SLC is its Membership.

      A Group's Membership may contain any Player who is not a Member
      of any other Group. Initially, the Group's Membership must
      contain at least three Foundors. The Ordinancekeepor and the
      Vizier of a Group must, at all times, be Members of the Group;
      if either ceases to be a Member of the Group, it dissolves.

      Each Group has Mint Authority.

      A Group's Voting Power on a Democratic Proposal is as follows:

        (a) A Group containing fewer than three members: zero;
        (b) A Group containing at least three members: the number of
            Players divided by the number of Groups with at least
            three members, rounded down.

[CFJ 816: There may exist more than one Group.]

The Public Forum
d502 83
a584 44
      A Public Forum is a medium of communication so designated by
      the Registrar. Sending a message to a Public Forum shall be
      considered the equivalent of sending that message to all
      Players.

      A Discussion Forum is a medium of communication so designated
      by the Registrar. A Discussion Forum shall never be a Public
      Forum, and a message is not considered to have been sent to
      all Players solely because it was sent to a Discussion Forum.

      The Registrar may designate a given medium of communication to
      be (or cease to be) a Public Forum or a Discussion Forum Without
      Objection. An announcement of such a designation shall be made
      via the medium whose designation is being changed. Any
      designation of a medium as a Public Forum shall also be
      announced via all existing Public Fora in addition to any
      other requirements.

      It is the responsibility of every Active Player to ensure that
      e is able to receive messages via each and every Public Forum.
      Any inability of a Player to receive messages via a particular
      Public Forum does not deprive that medium of its legal status
      as a Public Forum. Players are in no way required to receive
      messages via any particular Discussion Forum.

      The Registrar shall include as part of eir Report all media
      which are currently Public or Discussion Fora and sufficient
      data regarding each medium to allow new Players to receive
      messages via that medium.

      Any communication which has been sent via a Public Forum shall
      be considered to have been made publicly. Any communication
      which has been sent to all Players via some other medium, or
      combination of mediums, shall be considered to have been made
      publicly, provided it contains some clear designation that it
      is intended to be public.

      If the Rules require a Player to publish certain information,
      then e is considered to have satisfied that requirement at the
      time e publicly sends a message containing the information e is
      required to publish.

      If the Rules require a Player to announce certain information,
      that announcement must be made publicly.

a8032 30
      (a) There is a type of Auction called a Single-Bid Auction. The
          procedure for conducting a Single-Bid Auction is the same as
          that used in the Default Auction Procedure, with the
          following additions and exceptions:

          (1) Bid Inflation Factor: As part of any correct and legal
              announcement that a Single-Bid Auction is commencing,
              the Auctioneer must announce the value of the Bid
              Inflation Factor for the Auction, a real number between
              0 and 1 inclusive.

          (2) Making Bids: Each Player eligible to bid in the Auction
              is permitted to make only one bid, called the initial
              Bid.  Any bids made by a Player after eir initial Bid in
              the Auction are invalid. A Player who cancels eir bid is
              ineligible to make further bids in the Auction. All Bids
              must be made publically.

          (3) Value of Bids: at each midnight GMT during the Auction,
              the value of each valid, uncancelled Bid remaining in
              the Auction is increased by an amount equal to the Bid
              Inflation Factor multiplied by the initial Bid.

          (4) Final Auction Price: for the purposes of determining the
              Winner(s) of the Auction, the value of each Bid as
              calculated in (3) above is used.  However, the debt
              incurred by a Winner of the Auction is equal to the Nth
              highest Winning Initial Bid, where N is the number of
              items being Auctioned, or to the Starting Bid, if there
              were fewer than N bids.

        c) If there is still no eligible Judge, then all non-frozen
           Players Barred by the Caller become eligible to Judge that
           CFJ.

        d) If there is still no eligible Judge, then all non-frozen
           Barred Players, other than the Caller emself, become
           eligible to Judge that CFJ.

        e) If there is still no eligible Judge, then the Caller has
           happened upon a generational ship whose members are in
           suspended animation.  The Rules suggest that the Caller try
           calling when we arrive at our destination and thaw out.

      This Rule can require Inactive Players to perform actions.

      registered Players, plus the total Stain of all Players.
d8578 42
a8619 31
      The Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) is the total
      number of Indulgences owned by entities other than the Bank,
      augmented by the total number of Indulgences owned by the Bank
      which have been auctioned off to Winning Bidders in prior
      Indulgence Auctions but not yet paid for.  The Monthly Bank
      Indulgence Gain (MBIG) is the number of Indulgences transferred
      from other entities to the Bank during a given Agoran Month,
      less the number of Indulgences transferred from the Bank to
      other entities during that same Agoran Month.

      As soon as possible after the start of each month, the Herald
      shall calculate the Indulgence Differential, which is equal to
      the IICL minus the AICL, rounded down to the nearest integer.
      To calculate the Indulgence Differential, the Herald shall
      determine the number of Blots and the number of Indulgences
      owned as published in the most recent Herald's Report; other
      values in the formula shall be determined as of the time of the
      calculation.

      If the Indulgence Differential is greater than zero, then the
      Herald shall, as soon as possible after the start of that month,
      auction a number of Indulgences equal to the Indulgence
      Differential; if the Indulgence Differential is not greater than
      zero, the Herald shall auction a whole number of Indulgences
      equal to or less than one half the MBIG for the preceeding
      month, with a minimum of 0 Indulgences.

      In an Indulgence Auction held in accordance with this rule, the
      items to be auctioned are individual Indulgences, and thus the
      number of items is equal to the number of Indulgences to be
      Auctioned.  The Auction shall be conducted in Stems.

      (a) Each active player is eligible to judge a given CFJ, unless

          are ineligible to judge CFJs.

      (b) If the Clerk of the Courts is required to select a Judge,

          account, no player is eligible to judge that CFJ, then:

          (1) All active non-barred players become eligible to judge
              that CFJ.

          (2) If there is still no player eligible to judge, then all
              active barred players, other than the caller emself,
              become eligible to judge that CFJ.

          (3) If there is still no eligible Judge, then the game is in

          Bank which either:

          (1) are already being Auctioned by the Bank in prior
              Indulgence Auctions that have not yet concluded; or

          (2) have been auctioned in prior Indulgence Auctions that
              have concluded, but where the debts arising from Winning
              Bids have neither been paid nor defaulted upon; or

          and the AICL; if the AICL is greater than the IICL, the
          Indulgence Surplus is zero.

      (d) If the Indulgence Surplus is positive at the beginning of
          the month, the Herald shall as soon as possible auction off
          the surplus Indulgences. The items to be auctioned are
          individual Indulgences; the number of items is equal to the

          Indulgences transferred from other entities to the Bank
          during a given Nomic Month, less the number of Indulgences
          transferred from the Bank to other entities during that same
          Nomic Month.

      (f) If the Indulgence Surplus is zero or negative at the
          beginning of the month, the Herald may still conduct an
          Indulgence auction, but only if e initiates it within one
          week after the beginning of the month. The items to be
          auctioned are individual Indulgences; the number of items is
          chosen by the Herald, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of
          half the MBIG, rounded down to the nearest integer. The

      For a Parliamentary Proposal, the Assessor will count as
      "Preliminary Votes" after the voting period has ended:
        1.  For the First Estate, communications from Acolyte Players
            or their executors that would have been legal votes if the
            Proposal had been Sane.
        2.  For the Second Estate, communications from Politician
            Players or their executors that would have been legal
            votes if the Proposal had been Sane.
        3.  For the Third Estate, communications from Scribe Players
            or their executors that would have been legal votes if the
            Proposal had been Sane.

      For each Estate, if the preliminary votes of Players in that
      Estate (both voting index and quorum) would have passed the
      Proposal were they deemed to be Democratic votes on a Sane
      Proposal, then that Estate shall be deemed to have cast 1 vote
      FOR the Proposal; otherwise, that Estate shall be deemed to have
      cast 1 vote AGAINST the Proposal. The timing of all votes cast
      on Parliamentary Proposals shall be deemed to be an instant
      before the end of the Voting Period. There are no other specific
      mechanisms for casting votes on Parliamentary Proposals.

      (2) at least one fifth of all non-frozen players cast votes on
          it.

      Quorum for a democratic proposal shall be determined from the
      number of non-frozen players and number of active noisy players
      at the time that the proposal was distributed, or at the time it
      was made a democratic proposal, whichever is later.

      A Parliamentary Proposal acheives quorum if at least two of the

      Whenever a Player is required to perform an action "as soon
      as possible", then e is required to perform the action within
      a week.

      A Player who fails to observe this requirement commits the
      Class 1 Infraction of Tardiness.  All Players are authorized to
      detect and report the commission of the Infraction of Tardiness.

      This Rule does not deprive actions which do not conform to its
      requirements of whatever effects they would otherwise have.
      Rather, this Rule defines the latest time at which actions to be
      performed "as soon as possible" may be performed without
      incurring a penalty.

d1061 1
a1061 1
Rule 1016/14 (Power=2)
d1064 19
a1082 41
      Each player has an activity level, which is always exactly one
      of active, inactive, and frozen.  A player's activity level may
      not be modified except by methods described explicitly in the
      rules.

      This rule takes precedence over each rule that regulates
      activity levels and the powers or duties that a player may have
      because of eir activity level.

      An activity level of active is higher than any other activity
      level.  An activity level of inactive is higher than an activity
      level of frozen.

      Whenever a player registers or reregisters, e becomes active.

      A player may lower eir activity level by announcing that e does
      so and indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do
      not permit that player to change to that activity level.  If the
      player becomes inactive in this way, e may not become active
      until at least 96 hours after e last become inactive.

      An inactive player may become active by announcing that e does
      so, unless the rules do not permit that player to become active.

      A frozen player who has been frozen for at least 90 days may
      increase eir activity level by announcing that e does so and
      indicating eir new activity level, unless the rules do not
      permit that player to change to that activity level.

      "Off hold" and "on hold" are unambiguous synonyms for "active"
      and "inactive", respectively.  "put in cold storage" is an
      unambiguous synonym for "frozen".

      Only an active player may vote, make proposals, hold office, or
      be a Judge of a CFJ.  An inactive player may not be required by
      the rules to perform any duty or action unless the rules
      explicitly state that they can require inactive players to
      perform that duty or action.  A frozen player may not be
      required by the rules to perform any duty or action.

      Not being Active is a Win-Preventing Condition.

Rule 1042/17 (Power=1)
d1144 15
a1158 30
      Each player is always Noisy, Quiet, or Silent, but never more
      than one of these.  Whenever a player registers or posts to a
      public forum, that player is Noisy.

      A player who has not within the most recent 24 hours caused
      another player to become Quiet may cause another Active Noisy
      player to become Quiet by sending a message to a public forum in
      which e identifies the player and states that e causes that
      player to become Quiet.  Whenever a player has been Quiet
      continuously for two weeks, Inactive continuously for two
      months, or Frozen continuously for two years, e becomes Silent.

      Any player may publicly allege that some other player has
      abandoned the game.  A player has abandoned the game if and only
      if e is Silent.  As soon as possible after a public allegation
      that a player has abandoned the game, the Registrar shall
      publicly confirm or deny the allegation.

      If the allegation is confirmed, then the following events shall
      occur in order:

       (i) if the Silent player is the Speaker, e commits the Class 15
           Crime of Speaker Abandonment and ceases to be Speaker, and
           the Speaker-Elect becomes Speaker;

      (ii) the Silent player is deregistered.

      The Silent player shall be deemed to have been deregistered as
      of the timestamp of the message from the Registrar confirming
      the allegation.

      that a Player (herein called the Ninny) has acted or has failed
      to act in such a way as to be in violation of one or more Rules
      is judged TRUE, then the Judge so finding may Order that Player
      to submit, within 72 hours, a Formal Apology.  If the Ninny is
      Ready and the act or failure to act is not subject to penalties
      by virtue of being defined to be a Crime or an Infraction, then
      the Judge must issue such an Order as soon as possible after the
      Clerk of the Courts publishes the judgement.

      A Formal Apology shall consist of a letter of at least 200
      words, to be published by the Ninny, explaining the Ninny's
      error, shame, remorse, and ardent desire for self-improvement.

      The Judge issuing such an Order may, at eir discretion, include
      in eir Order a list of up to ten Prescribed Words (to be chosen
      by the Judge) which must be included in the Formal Apology.  If
      the Judge elects to include Prescribed Words, all of the Words
      required must appear within the Formal Apology.

      The failure to abide by an Order to Submit a Formal Apology is
      the Class 3 Infraction of Failure to Apologize, to be reported
      by the Judge who issued the original Order.

      If a Call For Judgement (CFJ) clearly alleging that a Player has

      down to the nearest whole integer, or four Blots if its
      Power exceeds four, unless the violated Rule explicitly defines
      or forbids a Blot penalty in the case of a CFJ.  The penalty
      shall be as defined in the Rule, if the Rule defines it; no Blot
      penalty shall be imposed if the Rule forbids it.

      The Player who initially called for the CFJ shall notify the
      Herald of the Blot assessment.

      If such a Judgement is overturned upon appeal, then the Player
      who received Blots shall expunge the Blots that were given due
      to the initial Judgement of the CFJ and notify the Herald of
      this action.

      A Player who is within the Jurisdiction of a SLC is required to
      abide by it while e remains within its Jurisdiction, unless
      doing so would violate either the Rules or another SLC with
      higher precedence.

      A Player who fails to abide by a SLC is in violation of that
      SLC.  A Player who is found by a CFJ to have violated a SLC
      shall suffer whatever penalties specified in the Rules
      authorizing the violated SLC, or, if there is no such penalty
      specified, a default penalty of one Blot, to be reported by
      the Judge of the CFJ.

      There shall be no additional penalty imposed upon a Player who
      violates this Rule by violating a SLC; this Rule takes
      precedence over any Rule which specifies penalties for violating
      Rules.

Rule 1457/11 (Power=1)
d9077 5
a9081 27
      When any Player believes that a Subordinate Legal Code (SLC) has
      been violated by a Player within the SLC's Jurisdiction e shall
      inform the Maintainer of that SLC of that belief, along with the
      nature of the violation, the violated text of the SLC, and the
      identity of the violating Player. The Maintainer shall then, as
      soon as possible, distribute this information to all Players
      within the Jurisdiction of the violated SLC.

      If, within 72 hours of this distribution, no Player within the
      SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim, the Maintainer shall
      declare the SLC violated.  The Maintainer is then allowed to
      initiate any corrections and penalties allowed by the Rules and
      the violated SLC.

      If any Player under the SLC's Jurisdiction disputes the claim
      of violation within 72 hours, then any Player may submit a Call
      for Judgement, alleging that a specific Player has violated the
      SLC. Such a CFJ cannot be made in any other circumstance.

      All Players within the SLC's Jurisdiction are automatically
      ineligible to Judge such a CFJ.

      Whenever such a CFJ is found TRUE, the SLC has been violated and
      the SLC's Maintainer shall perform the same duties as when no
      Player contests the claim. If such a TRUE Judgement is
      overturned on Appeal, those actions shall be reversed to the
      extent possible immediately upon the resolution of the appeal.

Rule 1431/15 (Power=1)

a1591 27
      A Claim of Error is a public message to the effect that a
      specific public communication misrepresents the actual Game
      State, and documenting the nature of the error.

      A Response to a Claim of Error posting publicly either a denial
      of the Claim or an admission of the Claim. If the Claim is
      admitted, then the Player making the admission is required to
      post a corrected version of the relevant portion of the message
      which was in error, before one week passes from the time the
      Claim of Error was made. A Player who admits a Claim but does
      not publish a correction is deemed not to have Responded to that
      Claim.

      A Response must be provided by the Player who is required by the
      Rules to publish the information subject to a Claim within one
      week of the Claim being made, unless any of the following holds:
       * a previous Claim was made concerning the same error
       * the relevant message has been posted more than 21 days before
       * another message by the same Player has corrected the error
       * the Claim is in dispute

      A Player who fails to post a Response within the allotted time
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Delayed COE Response, to be
      reported by the Player who posted the Claim. A Player who
      incorrectly issues a denial of a Claim commits the Crime of
      Wrongful COE Denial, a Class 1 Crime, unless e then admits the
      Claim within 72 hours after the incorrect denial.

Rule 1991/1 (Power=1)
Opposite Proposals

      Each time the Promotor distributes Proposals, e shall first
      select at random a single distributable Proposal, to be known as
      the Target. E may then distribute with these Proposals an
      Opposite Proposal for the Target. If e does so, e may, Without 2
      Objections, pay out 0.1 Papyri to emself.

      An Opposite Proposal should be clearly marked as such.  It
      should be substantially the opposite, in spirit or effect, of
      its Target. An Opposite Proposal shall have the same status as
      its Target, including AI, Sanity, Urgentness, Disinterestedness,
      and Democraticity; except that, if the Target does not have an
      AI of at least 2, the Opposite Proposal shall be neither
      Democratic nor Sane.

      The Promotor shall be considered to be the proposer of the
      Opposite Proposal, but shall incur no penalties as a result of
      being its proposer. This Rule takes precedence over all Rules
      which would impose such penalties.

      When a rule requires a random choice, that choice shall be made
      among all the possible choices with equal probability.
a714 16
      Because of the impossibility of finding a truly random test,
      "equal", for the purposes of the above statement, shall mean
      "reasonably close to equal".  It is up to common sense to
      determine what is reasonably close to equal; however, the burden
      of proof of a method's randomness lies with the Player who used
      the method.

      The probability of a Platonic solid or coin, which is not
      specially weighted, falling on any given face is, for the
      purposes of this Rule, close enough to equal to satisfy the
      above requirement.

      The Speaker shall make all random determinations required by the
      Rules except when the Rules specify another party to make the
      determination.

      During each Week, the Promotor must either distribute every
      Proposal that was Distributable at the beginning of that Week,
      or announce that there were no such Proposals. Failure to do so
      is the Class 1 Infraction of Promotor Tardiness, which any
      Player may detect and report.

      The distribution of each Proposal shall be accompanied by the
      identity of its Proposing Entity, and an indication of the
      Proposal's Chamber.  However, the failure of the Promotor to
      distribute any of these accompaniments with a Proposal does not
      deprive the distribution of the Proposal of any legal effect.

      A Proposal is legally distributed only if it is explicitly
      marked as such. When a Proposal is distributed, it is removed
      from the Proposal Pool.

      The Promotor shall not distribute any Proposal which is not
      Distributable, and must abort any Proposal so distributed. If
      the Promotor aborts a Proposal which e knows was Distributable
      at the time it was distributed, e commits the Class 2 Crime of
      Illegal Abortion.

      The Promotor aborts a Proposal by publishing an announcement to
      that effect, clearly identifying the Proposal which has been
      aborted.  When a Proposal is aborted:

      (a)  the Voting Period for that Proposal immediately ends, if it
           has not ended already;
      (b)  all Votes cast on that Proposal are cancelled, and the
           Proposal fails;
      (c)  the Assessor is relieved of any duty to report on Votes
           cast on that Proposal; and
      (d)  the Proposal is added to the Proposal Pool.

      The distribution of an Undistributable Proposal, when the
      Promotor knows that the Proposal is Undistributable, is the
      Class 2 Crime of Promotor Misrepresentation. The distribution of
      a text purporting to be a Proposal, when the Promotor knows that
      the text is not a Proposal, is the Class 5 Crime of Promotor
      Fraud.

        2.  Communications from non-Oligarch Players or their
            executors which would have been legal votes if the
            Proposal had been Democratic.
        3.  Public communications from an untainted Speaker,
            indicating a Veto of the Proposal.

      If the preliminary votes of the Oligarch Players (both voting
      index and quorum, with the exception that the Speaker's Veto
      does not affect this determination of quorum) would have passed
      the Proposal were they deemed to be Ordinary Votes on an
      Ordinary Proposal, the Oligarchy shall be deemed to have cast 1
      vote FOR the Proposal, otherwise the Oligarchy will be deemed to
      have cast 1 vote AGAINST.

      If the preliminary votes of the non-Oligarch Players (both
      voting index and quorum) would have passed the Proposal were
      they deemed to be Democratic Votes on a Democratic Proposal, the
      Democracy shall be deemed to have cast 1 vote FOR the Proposal,
      otherwise the Democracy will be deemed to have cast 1 vote
      AGAINST.

      If the untainted Speaker Vetoed the Proposal, the Speakership
      shall be deemed to have cast 1 vote AGAINST the Proposal,
      otherwise the Speakership shall be deemed to have cast 1 vote
      FOR the Proposal.

      The timing of all votes cast on Parliamentary Proposals shall be
      deemed to be an instant before the end of the Voting Period.
      There are no other specific mechanisms for casting votes on
      Parliamentary Proposals.

      The Chamber Fee for a Proposal is initially 0.1 Voting
      Entitlements.  Any Politician may change the Chamber of a
      Proposal that is not Sane to another Chamber of eir choice, by
      publicly paying this fee, provided that it is legal for the
      Proposal to be in the new Chamber.  When a Proposal's Chamber is
      changed via this Rule:

        (i)  The Chamber Fee for the Proposal is doubled;
        (ii) If the Proposal is in its Voting Period, it is Aborted as
             described elsewhere, and returned to the Proposal Pool
             with its Distributability and other characteristics
             intact.

      An Untainted Speaker, with 2 Supporters, may Sanitise a
      Distributed Proposal that is not already Sane and for which the
      Voting Period has not ended. If this happens, the Proposal is
      Aborted as described elsewhere, but remains Distributable and
      becomes Democratic and Sane.

          except that no transfer of property takes place thereby.

Rule 1887/16 (Power=1)
Default Procedure for Auctions
d7512 21
a7532 23
      When an Auction is required and the procedure is not defined
      elsewhere, the Auctioneer shall select a rules-defined Auction
      Procedure and publicly announce eir selection. If e does not
      specify which procedure is used, the Default Auction Procedure
      shall be used.

      The details specified herein are for the Default Auction
      Procedure.

      (a) Auctioneer: The Auctioneer is responsible for collecting
          bids and announcing the result of the Auction.  The
          Auctioneer is the Player who initiates the Auction.  If the
          Rules require or allow an Auction to be initiated, but do
          not specify which Player shall initiate it, then the Speaker
          shall initiate it.

      (b) Bidders: Every Player not on Hold may Bid in an Auction.
          Activity is measured at the time a Player sends eir Bid.

      (c) Auction Currency: Each Auction is conducted in one
          particular currency. The Rule requiring a particular
          Auction must specify the currency to be used, or the
          Auction cannot take place.
d7534 1
a7534 1
      (d) Number of Lots: Each Auction is conducted for 1 or more
d7539 78
a7616 52
      (e) Start of Auction: The Auction begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that an Auction is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is published, together with the
          identity of the Auctioneer, the Auction Currency, the number
          of items, and the value of the Starting Bid.

      (f) Starting Bid: The Starting Bid is the minimum possible
          value of a bid. If not otherwise specified, the Starting
          Bid is equal to the MUQ of the Auction Currency.

      (g) Making Bids: Each Bidder may make as many Bids as e desires
          during the Auction.  A Bid is a public message, announcing
          that the sender is bidding in that particular Auction, and
          the amount of eir Bid.  A Bid is only valid if it satisfies
          the following conditions:
          (1) The Bid is not made before the start of the Auction, or
              after its end.
          (2) The amount Bid is a multiple of the MUQ of the Auction
              Currency.
          (3) The amount Bid is no less than the Starting Bid.

      (h) Canceling Bids: A Bid may be cancelled by its Bidder by
          publicly posting such, clearly identifying the Bid to be
          cancelled, while the Auction is in progress.

      (i) End of Auction: If, one week after the Auction started,
          there have been no Bids made, the Auction ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Auction ends when 72 hours have
          passed without a valid Bid higher than the Nth-highest Bid
          (at the time the Bid is made) having been made. The Auction
          shall end 14 days after the Auction has started, if it has
          not ended earlier.

      (j) Winning Bids: When the Auction ends, the winning Bids are
          the N largest uncancelled valid Bids in that auction (or
          all valid uncancelled Bids, if there were less than N valid
          uncancelled Bids). Ties shall be broken in favor of earlier-
          submitted bids.

          The Final Auction Price is:
          (1) The amount of the Nth highest Bid, if there were N or
              more valid uncancelled Bids in the auction;
          (2) The Starting Bid, if there were fewer than N valid
              uncancelled Bids.

          As soon as possible after the end of the Auction, the
          Auctioneer shall announce the winning Bids and issue to each
          winning Bidder a separate bill for each of eir winning Bids.

      Unless specified otherwise, the owner of the Auctioned items
      shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to the
      winning Bidder when the bill for that lot is paid.

          Activity is measured at the time a Player sends eir Bid. Any
          Player with the same Executor as the Auctioneer may bid only
          in the first 72 hours of the Auction.

      (b) Making Bids: If the Bidder has the same Executor as the
          Auctioneer, then the Bids must be made in a message to a
          Public Forum. Otherwise, the Bidder may either Bid in a
          Public Forum or privately to the Auctioneer.

      (b) Entrants: Every Player not on Hold may enter the Raffle.
          Activity is measured at the time a Player enters the
          Raffle. However, if a rule prohibits a player from bidding
          in this Auction, then e is also prohibited from buying
          tickets.

      (c) Raffle Currency: Each Raffle is conducted in one particular
          currency. The Rule requiring a particular Raffle must
          specify the currency to be used, or the Raffle cannot take
          place.

      (d) Number of Lots: Each Raffle is conducted for 1 or more
          identical lots of identical items, which must all be owned
          by the same entity. Throughout this Rule, N indicates the
          number of lots up for bid in the Raffle.

      (e) Start of Auction: The Raffle begins at the time the first
          correct and legal announcement that a Raffle is begun, as
          defined in other Rules, is published, together with the
          identity of the Riff-Raff, the Raffle Currency, the number
          of items, and the Ticket Price.

      (f) Ticket Price: All tickets shall have the same Ticket Price.

      (g) Buying Tickets: An Entrant buys a ticket by paying a Fee of
          the Ticket Price in the Raffle Currency to the Bank,
          provided that the purchase is not made before the start of
          the Auction, or after its end. Each Entrant may buy as many
          tickets as e desires during the Auction.

      (h) End of Raffle: If, one week after the Raffle started, no
          Raffle tickets have been bought, the Raffle ends, and has no
          winner. Otherwise the Raffle ends when 72 hours have passed
          without a valid ticket purchase having been made. The Raffle
          shall end 14 days after the Raffle has started, if it has
          not ended earlier.

      (i) Winning Tickets: When the Raffle ends, the Riff-Raff shall
          randomly determine N valid Raffle tickets as having won the
          Raffle. Each Raffle ticket has one chance to win, and
          multiple Raffle tickets bought by the same Entrant may win.

          shall incur a debt of one Auctioned lot of items to each

      The Executor of the creditor of any unsatisfied debt may, at any
      time, demand the debtor to satisfy that debt, provided e has not
      already done so.  E does so by sending a message to the debtor
      setting forth the demand.  The debtor shall have seven days to
      satisfy the debt from the time the demand is sent, except that
      if the debtor's Executor is not active at the time the demand is
      sent, the debtor shall instead have seven days from the time eir
      Executor becomes active to satisfy the debt.  Time during which
      a debt is disputed is not counted for any purpose of this Rule.

      A debt not satisfied within the time allowed by this Rule
      becomes delinquent when that time elapses.  It ceases to be
      delinquent when it is satisfied.

      Any Player who is either:
        (a) the Executor of an entity which owes a delinquent debt, or
        (b) a Limited Executor of an entity which has no Executor and
            which owes a delinquent debt, where:
          (1) that Player has the authority to execute a transfer for
              that entity which would satisfy the delinquent debt, and
          (2) that entity possesses sufficient Property such that the
              delinquent debt can be satisfied;
      commits the Class 1 Infraction of Persistent Indebtedness when
      that debt first becomes delinquent, and commits it again every
      seven days thereafter for as long as the debt remains
      delinquent.  This Infraction may be reported by the creditor of
      the delinquent debt.

Restrictions on Setting Power

      Except as described in this Rule, no entity can set the Power
      of another entity to exceed the Power of the entity causing
      the Power to be so set.  A Rule may set the Power of an adopted
      Proposal, even exceeding the Power of the Rule, so long as the
      Power of the adopted Proposal does not exceed the Voting Index
      of that Proposal.

      No entity may destroy or repeal an entity with Power greater
      than its own.

      No Rule may have Power less than 1 or greater than 4.

Insanity

      An Interested Proposal is Insane, if it contains no minuscule
         letter.
      (That is the opposite of CAPITAL, for those who know not
         better.)

      For such a Proposal, until the Voting Period has ended:
      there shall be no discussing Votes, or this Rule has been
         bended.
      Nor shall a Player Vote in public, only to Assessor.
      The Votes shall be unknown to others, even employer and
         professor.

      And should a Player split eir votes 'tween FOR and
          AGAINST like crazy,
      E will annoy Assessors (who are known for being lazy)
      So should eir votes cast differ from each other, this Rule's
          broke,
      With the breaker being the voting Player, as sure as if e'd
          spoke.

      And should such a Proposal's Voting Period begin,
      but no one Votes FOR it, the Proposer shall Win.

CFJ 1178, Judged TRUE Nov. 18 1999: "Rule 1729 permits voting on
Insane Proposals by private message to the Assessor, even when the
prevailing mode of voting on Proposals is Public."

[CFJ 1078, Judged TRUE 8 January 1998: "Morendil violated Rule 1729 by
 voting on Proposal 3640 in the Public Forum."]

[In CFJ 1354 (6 May 2002), Judge root found that Winning wasn't
 sufficient reward to make an Insane Proposal coercive in the sense of
 Rule 1003.  This judgement depended on root's assessment of the
 current rewards for Winning, not on Winning's intrinsic appeal.
 Thus, "I do not find that the possibility of awarding one Player a
 Patent Title and 100 Stems is a sufficient 'punishment' alone to
 coerce anyone into voting FOR the Proposal."]

The Usuror's Budget

      The Usuror shall have a Budget.  The Usuror's Budget shall

        (i) The Basic Fee for issuing Bonds.  This Fee shall be
            expressed as a multiple of the Basic Officer Salary and
            shall be an integral multiple of 0.1, not less than 0, and
            not greater than 4.

       (ii) The purchase rates at which the Bank will buy Bonds in
            each Bank Currency. These rates are expressed as
            percentages, in the range 0% to 100% inclusive. Each
            purchase rate applies only to a single combination of face
            value and time to maturity. Different rates may apply to
            different such combinations. Any combination for which no
            rate is specified has a purchase rate of 0%.

      (iii) The Player Credit Limit for Stems, which is a multiple of
            the Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10 inclusive.

       (iv) The Non-Player Entity Credit Limit for Stems, which is a
            multiple of the Basic Officer Salary, between 0 and 10
            inclusive.

        (v) The Player Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other than
            Stems, which is a multiple of the MUQ of that Currency
            between 0 and 2000 inclusive.

       (vi) The Non-Player Credit Limit for each Bank currency, other
            than Stems, which is a multiple of the MUQ of that
            Currency between 0 and 2000 inclusive.

Rule 1966/0 (Power=1)
Bonds

      Bonds are Property.  Each Bond, in addition to being a Property,
      has the following characteristics:
      (a) an issuer (which must be a Player or an entity with an
          Executor);
      (b) a face value, expressed as the positive multiple of the MUQ
          of some Currency; and
      (c) a maturity date.

      A species of Bond consists of all Bonds with the same issuer,
      face value and maturity date.  All Bonds of a given species are
      fungible.  In any transaction involving Bonds, it is sufficient
      to identify the Bonds involved by species.

      The Recordkeeper of Bonds shall be the Usuror.

      A Bond is mature on and after its maturity date, and is immature
      prior to that date.  If the maturity date of a Bond is specified
      only as a date, it shall be presumed to mature at midnight UTC
      of that day (the beginning of that day).

Rule 1967/0 (Power=1)
Creation of Bonds

      New Bonds are created when an entity with Bond Issuance
      Authority sends a message to the Usuror stating that e is
      creating one or more new Bonds, provided that that message sets
      forth the face value and maturity date of each Bond to be
      created, and by paying the applicable Fee (if any) for creating
      those Bonds.  The newly created Bonds are possessed by the
      entity sending the message.  The issuer of the newly created
      Bonds is the entity sending the message.

      The Fee for creating Bonds shall be equal to the Basic Fee for
      issuing Bonds.  However, the Fee shall only be required for the
      first Bond of a given species created in the same message; there
      is no additional fee for additional Bonds of the same species
      created in the same message.  Furthermore, the Bank need never
      pay a Fee to create Bonds.

      This Rule defers to any Rule which imposes further restrictions
      on the ability of an entity to create new Bonds.

      The Bank, each Player, each Contest, and each Group all have
      Bond Issuance Authority.

Rule 1969/0 (Power=1)
Redemption of Bonds

      Any entity which possesses an unredeemed, mature Bond may redeem
      it by transferring the Bond to its Issuer, expressing in eir
      Notice of Transfer the purpose of redeeming the Bond.

      When the issuer of a Bond receives an unredeemed, mature Bond
      from another entity where the transfer was executed for the
      purpose of redemption, the Bond in question is thereby redeemed,
      and the issuer incurs a debt to the transferor of that Bond for
      the face value of the bond.

      If the issuer of a Bond receives an unredeemed, immature Bond
      from another entity where the transfer was executed for the
      purpose of redemption, the issuer incurs a debt to the
      transferor for that Bond; but if the Bond in question matures
      while still in the possession of the issuer, this debt is
      cancelled and the issuer incurs a debt to the transferor of that
      Bond for the face value of the Bond, as if the transfer had been
      made at the time the Bond matured.

      Once redeemed, a Bond may not be further transferred.

Rule 1971/1 (Power=1)
Bank Issuance of Bonds

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may issue Bonds with two Supporters.
      The number and species of Bonds to be issued must be set forth
      at the time the Treasuror seeks Support for the action.  The
      Bank may not otherwise issue Bonds except through the mechanism
      set forth in this paragraph.

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may Auction Bonds Without Three
      Objections.  Each Auction of Bank Bonds shall consist of some
      number of a single species of Bond.  The species of Bond, the
      number of Bonds of that species, the Auction Currency, and the
      Minimum Bid of each Auction shall be determined by the Treasuror
      as part of the message indicating eir intent to hold a Bank Bond
      Auction.

      The Bank is not required to actually possess the Bonds it
      intends to Auction at the time the intent to conduct an Auction
      is announced or at the time the Auction begins.  However, if the
      Bank, by virtue of not having sufficient quantity of some
      species of Bond, is unable to satisfy a debt arising from a Bond
      Auction within seven days of when the Auction ends, the Player
      who was Treasuror at the time the Auction began commits the
      offense of Selling the Blue Sky, a Class 6 Crime.

Rule 1972/0 (Power=1)
Acceleration of Bonds

      Whenever an entity which is the issuer of one or more
      nonredeemed Bonds ceases to have an Executor, all unredeemed
      Bonds issued by that entity are accelerated as described by this
      Rule.

      When a Bond is accelerated, the Bond immediately becomes mature
      and is deemed to have been redeemed.  The issuer becomes liable
      for a debt to the current owner of the Bond for the face value
      of the Bond.

      as described elsewhere.

Selling Bonds to the Bank

      A Player may sell a Bond by paying a Fee equal to that Bond,
      and informing the Usuror that e is selling the Bond.

      If the rules permit this sale, then Usuror shall then pay out to
      that player an amount equal to the face value of the Bond
      multiplied by the applicable purchase rate set in the Usuror's
      Budget. The value of the purchase rate shall be determined as at
      the time the Bond was transferred.

      If the rules do not permit the sale, then the Bank incurs a debt
      to the transferor for that Bond.

      The Bank, by the Treasuror, may redeem any mature Bonds it owns.

Rule 1978/2 (Power=1)
Credit and Credit Limits

      The credit in a given currency of an entity with Bond Issuance
      Authority is equal to the sum of the values of all Bonds owned
      by the Bank issued by that entity with a face value in that
      currency. The Usuror's Weekly Report shall list the credit in
      each currency of each non-Bank entity with Bond Issuance
      Authority, if that credit is greater than zero.

      The sale of a Bond is permitted only if one of the following is
      the case:
         * it is issued by the Bank.
         * it is issued by a player and would not cause the issuer's
           credit to exceed the Player Credit Limit in the currency in
           question as set forth in the Usuror's Budget.
         * it is issued by a non-Player entity other than the Bank and
           would not cause the issuer's credit to exceed the
           Non-Player Credit Limit in the currency in question as set
           forth in the Usuror's Budget.

      The Credit Limit for non-Bank currencies is 0.

      The Treasuror may, with Support, place or remove a moratorium on
      bond purchases in any specific Bank currency.  Once a moratorium
      has been placed, the Bank may not purchase any Bonds with a face
      value in that currency, until that moratorium is removed.

Bond Fraud

      A Player who sells to the Bank a Bond issued by an entity:
       * of which e is an Executor, which e is in collusion with, or
         an Executor of which e is in collusion with, and
       * that e believes will not, at the date of maturity, or does
         not, if the Bond is already mature, have funds to cover
         redemption of said Bond,
      commits the Class 5 Crime of Bond Fraud.  If it is judged that a
      player has committed Bond Fraud, the Judge shall order that all
      unlawful gains from said instance of Bond Fraud be disgorged.

      If the Executor of the issuer of a Bond used to commit Bond
      Fraud is not the Player who was charged with Bond Fraud, and
      said Executor knew that the Bond in question would be used for
      such a purpose, e commits the Class 4 Crime of Conspiracy to
      Commit Bond Fraud.

      may be filed with the Justiciar, Players are encouraged to file
      with the CotC unless there is a good reason not to.)

      For the purpose of this and other Rules, the submission of a CFJ
      shall constitute proof of the existence of a dispute.

      The Clerk shall distribute the text of a CFJ along with any
      additional material submitted by the Caller (including, but not

      presumption of perfect knowledge, to be either TRUE or FALSE.
      Statements which are inherently contradictory or which are
      vacuous are not acceptable, and a CFJ containing such a
      Statement shall not be Judged.

      If a CFJ fails to meet the requirements of this or of other
      rules it lacks standing and is to be dismissed.

      It is permitted for a Call for Judgement to contain Arguments,
      Evidence, or other material placed there at the Caller's
      discretion.  However, the Judge is not required to take notice
      of any part of the CFJ other than the Statement in formulating

      Whenever there is an open Call for Judgement to which no Player
      has been assigned as its Judge, the Clerk of the Court shall, as
      soon as possible after being made aware of this condition,
      select a Player to be assigned as its Judge and announce eir
      selection.  This selection shall be made from amongst all
      those Players eligible to serve as the Judge of that CFJ.

      Once selected as the Judge of a CFJ, that Player remains the
      Judge of that CFJ until e is Recused from that CFJ or becomes
      ineligible to Judge that particular CFJ.

      A CFJ is "open" if it has neither been dismissed nor judged, or
      if there is an outstanding judicial motion pertaining to that
      CFJ which has been neither granted nor denied.  A CFJ which is

      Caller, shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any players
      eligible to judge, and the Caller is a player, then the Caller
      shall be eligible.

      If this still does not result in there being any players

      that is a generational ship whose members are in suspended
      animation.  The Rules suggest that the Caller try calling when
      we arrive at our destination and begin to thaw out.

      This Rule can require On Hold Players to perform actions.

      The Deliberation Period for a CFJ begins when the Clerk of the

      later.

      In the week following the end of the Deliberation Period, if the
      Judge has not yet returned Judgement or Dismissed the CFJ, then
      the Clerk of the Courts may recuse the Judge from the CFJ and
      assign it to a new Judge, by posting an announcement to that
      effect.

      A Judge who Judges or Dismisses a CFJ after the end of the
      Deliberation Period, but before being recused as a Judge,
      commits the Class 0.5 Infraction of Judging a Bit Late, to be
      detected and reported by the Clerk of the Courts.

      A Judge who has neither Judged nor Dismissed a CFJ seven days
      after the end of its Deliberation Period is automatically
      recused from that CFJ.

      A Judge who is recused from a CFJ in accordance with this Rule
      commits the Class 3 Infraction of Failure to Judge (to be

      A Judge judges a CFJ by sending eir Judgement to the Clerk of

      FALSE.  Only the Judge assigned to a CFJ may Judge that CFJ.

      As soon as possible after the receipt of a legal Judgement, the
      Clerk shall publish the Judgement.

      If a Judge delivers Judgement on a CFJ before the end of
      the assigned deliberation period, then the Clerk of the
      Courts shall pay out to the Judge the Judicial Salary as

      In all other CFJs, the Judgement shall be consistent with the
      preponderance of the evidence at hand.

      Furthermore, it is a defense to any accusation of a Crime that
      the Player reasonably believed that eir actions were not a
      Crime at the time e performed them, or that e reasonably did not
      know that e was required to perform an action, when such
      nonperformance is defined as a Crime.  A Player shall not be

d5346 8
a5353 4
        i) It contains no clearly-identifiable Statement.
       ii) Its Statement can not logically admit to either being TRUE
           or FALSE.
      iii) Its Statement does not relate to a matter relevant to the
d5355 2
a5356 27
       iv) Its Statement fails to comply with the Rules.
        v) It lacks standing, as defined elsewhere.
       vi) After a reasonable effort by the Judge to obtain all
           relevant information, no determination can be made of the
           truth or falsity of its Statement.

      The Judge does this by notifying the CotC of the CFJ's
      dismissal, and the reasons e is doing so.  Dismissals are only
      legal when made for the reasons listed in this Rule.  Dismissal
      occurs when the CotC is notified of a legal dismissal.

      As soon as possible after being notified of a legal dismissal,
      the CotC must publicly post a notice of the dismissal and the
      Judge's reasons for doing so.

      If the dismissal, upon appeal, is subsequently set aside, then
      that CFJ is no longer dismissed. It shall be considered again
      and can not again be legally dismissed for the same reasons.

      A Judge who dismisses a CFJ before the end of the assigned
      deliberation period shall receive a Judicial Salary.

[CFJ 909, Mar. 17 1997: The phrase 'considered again' in Rule 1565
 should be interpreted such that when a dismissal of a CFJ has been
 set aside, the Clerk of the Courts should assign the CFJ to a new

      When an appeal is initiated, a Board of Appeals shall be
      selected in order to reach a decision about the consideration
      mandated by the appeal.

      A Board of Appeals consists of three distinct Players, called
      Justices.  The Clerk of the Courts selects the Justices for each
      Board, as follows, until three eligible Justices have been
      selected;  The Speaker is selected, if eligible; The Justiciar
      is selected, if eligible; The CotC is selected, if eligible; Any
      remaining positions are then filled by random selection, by the
      CotC, from all remaining eligible Players.
d5748 17
a5764 16
        i) E has already been selected to serve on that Board.
       ii) E has been dismissed as Justice from that Board.
      iii) E has been Judge in the matter the Board is to consider.
       iv) E is not eligible to Judge the CFJ that resulted in the
           matter under consideration, and this restriction does not
           prevent three eligible Players from being selected by the
           CotC for the Board.
        v) E is on Hold, and this restriction does not prevent three
           eligible Players from being selected by the CotC for the
           Board.
       vi) E is frozen.

      A Justice is permitted to appoint another eligible Player to
      replace em as Justice on a given Board, provided the Player
      consents. A Justice does this by notifying the Clerk of the
      Courts of the appointment.

      The Clerk of the Courts shall make an announcement in the Public

      including in eir announcement the matter of consideration of the
      Appeal and the identity of the Justices selected to serve on the
      Board of Appeals and which (if any) of these Players are
      ineligible to fill the positions to which they have been
      assigned.

      The Clerk shall also make an announcement to the Public Forum as
      soon as possible after any change in the identity of the
      Justices that takes place after the Board has been constituted.

      The Judgement entered in any CFJ by its Judge, the grant or
      denial of any Motion, and the execution of any Judicial Order
      are all subject to review on appeal to a Board of Appeal.  In
      addition, a Board of Appeal shall review any claim that a Judge
      has failed to perform any duty of a Judicial nature which e was
      required to perform.

      In all cases, the public insistence of any three Players is
      sufficient to initiate the appeal of a particular matter.  In
      the case of the appeal of a Judicial Order, the insistence of
      any Player bound by the Order is sufficient.  In the case of a
      Judgement which convicts a Player of a Crime, the insistence of
      the convicted Player is sufficient.

      In each cases before a Board of Appeal, it shall collectively
      decide whether to affirm or to reverse the matter under appeal,
      and shall execute whatever Appellate Orders are necessary to
      enforce its determination.

      Once a Board of Appeals has been selected to decide a particular
      appeal, the Justices shall, collectively, consider the question.
a5869 27
      Each Justice has seven days, from the point e becomes Justice on
      a particular Board, in which to reach a determination that
      either sustains or overturns the matter being considered by that
      Board and submit it to the CotC.

      Failure to do so is the Class 3 Infraction of Failing to Judge
      an Appeal, detected and reported by the Cotc. A Justice who does
      not submit eir determination to the CotC within seven days is
      immediately recused as a Justice from that Board. In this case
      the CotC must randomly select an eligible Player to replace em.

      After all three Justices have submitted their determinations to
      the CotC, the CotC shall publish these determinations along with
      any arguments, evidence, or other material included with those
      determinations.

      If a majority of the Justices agree to sustain the matter being
      considered, it is sustained; otherwise, it is overturned.  The
      specific results of overturning a matter upon appeal are
      determined by the Rules permitting such appeals.

      If a Justice submits eir determination to the Clerk of the
      Courts before the end of the assigned deliberation period,
      then the Clerk of the Courts shall pay out to that Justice
      the Judicial Salary as soon as possible after the publication
      of eir determination.

Appeal of a Judgement

      If the Judgement of a CFJ is Appealed, the Board of Appeals
      shall consider the correctness of that Judgement. The Board may
      rule that the original Judgement was either correct or
      incorrect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was correct, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was correct. In that case, the original Judge of the
      CFJ shall retain eir Judicial Salary and the original Judgement
      has legal effect.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, then the Board's ruling is that the original
      Judgement was incorrect. In that case, the original Judge
      of the CFJ shall forfeit eir Judicial Salary. The Board may
      then act in one of three ways, provided that a majority of
      the Justices agree:

        i) Reversal of the Judgement. In this case, the CFJ shall
           be treated as if it were Judged normally, with the
           Judgement being that which a majority of the Justices
           agree on.
       ii) Dismissal of the CFJ. The CFJ shall be considered
           dismissed.
      iii) Re-assignment of the CFJ. In this case, the original
           Judgement shall be ignored, and the CotC shall reassign
           the CFJ to a new Judge in the same fashion as it was
           originally assigned; the original Judge will be
           considered Ineligible. The new Judge cannot make the
           same Judgement as the original Judge for the same
           reason.

      If a majority of the Justices find that the original Judgement
      was incorrect, but no majority of the Justices agree on what
      action to take, then the CFJ shall be re-assigned as above.

      shall only consider whether the dismissal was properly
      made. An illegal dismissal shall not be considered
      "properly made."

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been properly
      made, the original Judge of the CFJ shall retain eir
      Judicial Salary, and the CFJ shall remain dismissed.

      If the Board finds the dismissal to have been made
      improperly, the original Judge of the CFJ shall have eir
      Judicial Salary revoked. The CotC shall reassign the CFJ
      to a new Judge in the same fashion as originally
      assigned; the new Judge cannot dismiss it for the same
      reasons as given by the original Judge.

Appeals of Judicial Orders

      appropriate for the situation.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made legally, and was
      appropriate for the situation, it shall affirm the Order.  If an
      Order staying the execution of the appealed Order was entered,
      it shall vacate this stay.

      If the Board finds that the Order was made illegally, or that it
      was inappropriate for the situation, it shall vacate the
      original Order.  Should the Board further find that the Order
      was made without reasonable justification or for a clearly
      improper purpose, it shall (at its discretion) impose a penalty
      of 2 Blots upon the Judge who made the original Order.

Rule 2000/0 (Power=1)
Rule Location

      The Rule Mapping is a Rules-defined calculation that maps
      a single integer (a Rule Number as defined elsewhere in the
      Rules) onto a single Latitude, Longitude pair within the limits
      of Latitude and Longitude on the Map of Arcadia.

      The Rule Mapping must be such that no two possible Rule Numbers
      between 101 and the Total Land Area of Arcadia are mapped to the
      same Latitude, Longitude pair.

      For any existent Rule, the Latitude and Longitude pair resulting
      from a Rule Mapping of the Rule's Number is the Rule's Location.
      A Rule's Location only changes if its Rule Number changes or if
      the Rule Mapping contained in this Rule changes.

      The Rule Mapping is defined by the following procedure:
        1.  The number 100 is subtracted from the Rule Number to
            calculate the number of Vulture Steps in the Rule Number's
            Vulture Journey.
        2.  The Latitude and Longitude of the Mapping shall be that of
            the Land Unit Visited when the final Vulture Step of the
            Rule Number's Vulture Journey is taken, where each Vulture
            Step in the Journey is taken as follows:

              (a) If no Vulture Steps have yet been taken in the
                  Journey, by visiting the Land Unit with Latitude 0,
                  Longitude 0; otherwise,
              (b) From the Land Unit most recently visited in the
                  specific Vulture Journey:
                  (i) If neither its Northern, nor Western, nor
                      Southern, nor Eastern Neighbor has been visited
                      in the Journey, by visiting its Eastern
                      Neighbor; otherwise,
                 (ii) If its Nothern, Western, and Southern Neighbors
                      have all been visited, by visiting
                      its Eastern Neighbor; otherwise,
                (iii) If its Western Neighbor has been visited but
                      its Northern Neighbor has not, by visiting its
                      Northern Neighbor, otherwise;
                 (iv) If the Southern Neighbor has been visited but
                      the Western Neightbor has not, by visiting the
                      Western Neighbor, otherwise;
                  (v) If the Eastern Neighbor has been visited but the
                      Southern Neighbor has not, by visiting the
                      Southern Neighbor, otherwise;
                 (vi) If the Northern Neigbor has been visited but

                      Eastern Neighbor.

This Landscape, This Ruleset

      Upon the adoption of this Rule, if a number which maps onto
      the Latitude, Longitude pair of an existent Unit of Land using
      the Rule Mapping, is not an existent Rule Number, the Unit's
      Land Type shall be changed to Aether.

      Otherwise, the Land Type of the Unit of Land at the Latitude,
      Longitude representing each Rule Number's Location:

        (i) shall be changed to Land Type Wilderness if the Rule has a
            Power greater than or equal to 1, but less than 2.

       (ii) shall be changed to Land Type Farmland if the Rule has
            a Power greater than or equal to 2, but less than 3.

      (iii) shall be changed to Land Type Urbana if the Rule has
            a Power of 3 or more.

      If a Rule Change enacts a new Rule, repeals an existing Rule, or
      changes the Power of a Rule, the Land Type at the Rule's
      Location shall be changed as above.  Land Types may still be
      changed by other Rules.

Rule 2003/3 (Power=1)
Moving in Arcadia
d10115 2
a10116 49
      Every week, each Player may expend up to 10 Movement Units to
      move about in the Land of Arcadia, and each Organization may
      expend up to 5 Movement Units.  Movement Units are not
      transferable, and do not persist from one week to the next.

      A player makes a Move by notifying the Mapkeepor of the location
      (the Destination) into which e is attempting to move.  If the
      Player has enough Movement Units left this week, and the Move is
      valid, the Player's Location is changed to the Destination.  So
      long as e does not spend more than eir allotted number of
      Movement Units, a Player may move as many times as e wishes in a
      single week.

      Players may expend:
        * 10 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Mountains.
        *  5 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Hills.
        *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness, Subtype Forest or Desert.
        *  3 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Wilderness with no Subtype.
        *  2 Movement Units to move into an adjacent unit of Type
          Farmland.
        *  1 Movement Unit to move into an adjacent unit of Type
           Urbana.

      A player may also expend 10 Movement Units to Explore, by
      notifying the Mapkeepor that e does so.  If a Player Explores,
      all units of Aether within a Penguin Distance of 2 from the
      Player's current location are assigned a new Land Type and
      possibly Subtype.  For each unit of Aether affected, there is a:
       * 0.15 probability it becomes the same type and subtype
              as the land at the location of the exploring Player;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Mountains;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Hills;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Wilderness/Forest;
       * 0.10 probability it becomes Wilderness/Desert;
       * 0.05 probability it becomes Farmland, no subtype;
       * 0.20 probability it becomes Water, no subtype.

      The random choice of new Land Type and Subtype is to be made by
      the Mapkeepor.  Affected units take on the new Land Type at the
      beginning of the next week, and all such changes shall be
      indicated in the Mapkeepor's Report for that week.

      Moves explicitly allowed by this Rule, including Exploring, are
      valid, unless made invalid by other Rules.  Unless explicity
      permitted by other Rules, all other Moves are invalid.

Developing Land

      A Player who owns a Unit of Land and is Located at that Unit of
      Land may change the Land Type and/or Subtype in the following
      manner:

      a) If the Unit of Land is of Type Wilderness, e may change that
         Unit of Land to Type Farmland by expending 5 Movement Points
         and paying a Fee of:

           i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Forest;

           ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Desert; or

           iii) 1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, if the Unit is of
                Subtype Mountain.

      b) If the Unit of Land is of Type Farmland, e may change that
         Unit of Land to Type Urbana by expending 5 Movement Points
         and paying a Fee of:

           i)   0.1 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit
                will have Subtype Road;

           ii)  0.25 BOS in Stems, rounded up, in which case the Unit
                will have Subtype Aqueduct; or

           iii) if there are no Units of subtype City within a Penguin
                Distance of 3 from the Unit, The Unit is Connected to
                a Unit of Water by Aqueduct, and there are at least 8
                Units of Farmland within a Penguin Distance of 2 from
                the Unit, 1 BOS in Stems, in which case the Unit will
                have Subtype City. In this case the Player is required
                to give a unique name to the City.

      Units affected by this Rule take on the new Land Type at the
      beginning of the next week, and all such changes shall be
      indicated in the Mapkeepor's Report for that week.

      When a Player registers (or reregisters), e is Off Hold.

      An Off Hold Player becomes On Hold when e announces in the
      Public Forum that e goes On Hold.

      An On Hold Player becomes Off Hold when e announces in the

      An action is Dependent (or may be performed Dependently) if
      and only if it is an Action With N Objections or an Action
      With N Supporters, where N is a positive integer not greater
      than five.  The phrase `Without Objection' is synonymous with
      `Without 1 Objection', and the phrase `With Support' is
      synonymous with `With 1 Supporter'.  The Rules may name
      specific actions as Dependent Actions.

      A Player may, in a Public Forum, unambiguously describe a
      particular Dependent Action which e is authorised by the
      Rules to perform Dependently, and announce eir intent to
      perform it.  That Player may perform that action if and only if:

      (a)  e announced eir intent at most fourteen days before
            attempting to perform it, and, in the case of Actions
            Without N Objections, at least four days before attempting
            to perform it;

      (b)  the authorising Rule explicitly indicates who may perform
           the action Dependently;

      (c)  during the time between the announcement made under
           (a) of this Rule and the attempt to perform the action,

           (1)  fewer than N Players have publicly posted Objections
                to the performance of the action, if the action is to
                be performed Without N Objections; or

           (2)  at least N Players other than the Player attempting to
                make the action have publicly posted Support for
                the performance of the action, if the action is to be
                performed With N Supporters; and

      (d)  e publicly announces that e performs the described action.

      Properties which would be changed by a Dependent Action
      do not occur until announced as in (d).

      The specification in the Rules that an action may be
      performed Dependently in no way prohibits performing that
      same action if doing so would otherwise be permissible.

      For the purposes of this Rule, a false statement of fact is made
      "willfully" when the Player making it, at the time the statement
      was made, has the intention to make a false statement of fact
      and knowledge that the statement actually made was false.
      Particularly, a Player who makes a false statement of fact
      through excusable negligence, reasonable error, or reasonable
      reliance on the representations of another, shall not be
      considered to have willfully made a false statement of fact.

      A conclusion as to the interpretation of the Rules or their
      application to a particular situation is not a "statement of
      fact".

a1909 44
      The Electee to an Office or the Speaker, if e holds that Office,
      is permitted to appoint another Player to perform the duties of
      that Office. This is called Delegation. The Player doing the
      appointing is herein referred to as the Delegating Player and
      the Player so appointed is herein referred to as the Delegated
      Player.

      An Office is legally Delegated if and only if the following
      conditions are met:

      (a) the Delegating Player has published a Notice of Delegation,
          naming the Office being Delegated and the Delegated Player;

      (b) the Delegated Player is permitted by the Rules to hold the
          Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;

      (c) the Delegated Player has published a Notice of Consent to
          Delegation for that Office during the seven days immediately
          preceding or immediately following the publishing of the
          Notice of Delegation.

      (d) the Delegating Player is still permitted to Delegate the
          Office at the commencement of the Period of Delegation;

      (e) the Period of Delegation has commenced and not yet
          concluded.

      The Period of Delegation commences at the time the Notice of
      Delegation is posted, or at the time the Notice of Consent to
      Delegation is posted, or at the time (if any) specified by the
      Delegating Player, whichever is latest. The Period of Delegation
      concludes when any of the following occur:

      (a) a Player other than the Delegating Player becomes the
          Electee to the Office;
      (b) the time (if any) specified by the Delegating Player as the
          end of the Period of Delegation is reached; or
      (c) the Delegated Office has been continuously Delegated for
          three weeks.

      During the Period of Delegation, the Delegating Player ceases to
      hold the Delegated Office; the Delegated Player holds the
      Office, and earns the Salary for that Office as described in
      other Rules.
d1911 3
a1913 5
      At the end of the Period of Delegation, the Delegated Player
      ceases to hold the Delegated Office, and the Electee to the
      Office commences holding the Office, if the Office has an
      Electee. If the Office has no Electee, then the Delegated Player
      continues to hold the Office.

	      Inflation Factor for the Auction, a real number between
	      0 and 1 inclusive.

	  (2) Making Bids: Each Player eligible to bid in the Auction
	      is permitted to make only one bid, called the initial
	      Bid.  Any bids made by a Player after eir initial Bid in
	      the Auction are invalid. A Player who cancels eir bid is
	      ineligible to make further bids in the Auction. All Bids
	      must be made publically.

	  (3) Value of Bids: at each midnight GMT during the Auction,
	      the value of each valid, uncancelled Bid remaining in
	      the Auction is increased by an amount equal to the Bid
	      Inflation Factor multiplied by the initial Bid.

	  (4) Final Auction Price: for the purposes of determining the
	      Winner(s) of the Auction, the value of each Bid as
	      calculated in (3) above is used. However, the debt
	      incurred by a Winner of the Auction is equal to eir
	      initial Bid.

Rule 1435/15 (Power=1)
Definition of Indulgences, Blots and Immaculate
a8496 29
      A Blot is a stain on a Player's record, recorded by the Herald.

      Whenever the Rules state that a Player gains or is assessed some
      number of Blots, and specify a method of reporting that gain or
      assessment to the Herald, then, as soon as possible after
      receiving such a notification, the Herald shall record an
      increase of that amount (or, if the affected Player is Unready,
      of one half (rounded to the nearest integer) of that amount) in
      the number of Blots staining the affected Player.

      Blots are expunged from a Player's record when:
      (1) an entity transfers to the Bank some number of Indulgences,
          specifying in the Notice of Transfer that the transfer is
          for the purpose of expunging the Blots of some Player; a
          number of Blots equal to the number of Indulgences
          transferred are expunged from the Player specified, or all
          of that Player's Blots if more Indulgences are transferred
          than that Player has (and the excess indulgences returned
          to the transferor); or
      (2) the Rules otherwise establish some method by which Blots
          are to be expunged, provided that such method must include
          a requirement of notice to the Herald of the expungement
          and such notice is actually sent to the Herald.

      A player with zero Blots staining eir record is said to be
      Immaculate.

      Not being Immaculate is a Win-Preventing Condition.

            number of Blots to one less than the threshold for

      When a Player is deregistered from the game while not
      Immaculate, e becomes a Fugitive from Justice.  The Herald
      shall continue to keep a record of the number Blots staining
      each Fugitive from Justice.

      At the beginning of each month, the Herald shall halve the
      number of Blots staining each Fugitive of Justice, rounding
      down; but no Fugitive from Justice shall have eir number of
      Blots reduced to less than one by this method.

      When a Fugitive from Justice reregisters, e ceases to be a
      Fugitive from Justice.  The act of reregistration causes
      no change in eir number of Blots.

a3595 19
      When the Voting Period for a Proposal has ended, the
      uncancelled votes which have been legally cast shall be counted
      by the Assessor. The Proposal shall then be assigned a Voting
      Index, as follows: if the Proposal received no votes opposed,
      and at least one vote in favor, the Voting Index shall be
      Unanimity; if there are no votes in favor, the Voting Index
      shall be zero; in all other cases, the Voting Index shall be
      the number of votes in favor divided by the number of votes
      opposed.

      If the Voting Index is greater than the Adoption Index for the
      Proposal, or if both equal Unanimity, and there were at
      least three votes in favor of the Proposal, then that Proposal
      is adopted.  Otherwise, it fails.

      A Proposal may not have its Voting Index set except
      as described in this Rule.  A Proposal may not be adopted
      (synonymous with the Proposal passing) except as described
      in this Rule.

            (b) A number of Stems shall be Created in the Bank's
                Possession, equal to the number Destroyed in (a) above

d3149 2

Rule 1934/4 (Power=2)
The Speaker, Sanity, and Buying Democracy

      An Untainted Speaker may, with 3 Supporters, Sanitise an Interested
      Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary Proposal, for
      which the Voting Period has not yet concluded, and which has
      never been the subject of an Attempt to Democratise.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised before its Voting Period commences,
      said Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, becomes a Sane Proposal,
      and has its Distribution Cost modified as required by other Rules.

      If a Proposal is Sanitised during its Voting Period, said
      Proposal is not modified until at least one Papyrus is publicly
      transferred to the Bank solely for this stated purpose by any
      Player during the Proposal's Voting Period.  If this happens,
      the Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal, the Proposal becomes
      a Sane Proposal, and all votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Assessor shall announce that the Proposal has
      been successfully Sanitised; the Voting Period of the Proposal
      is extended to end seven days after this announcement.

      Any Player may, With Support, make an Attempt to Democratise an
      Interested Proposal which would otherwise be an Ordinary
      Proposal, and for which the Voting Period has not yet concluded.
      There is a Fee of 0.1 VEs for a Player other than an Untainted
      Speaker to make an Attempt to Democratise.  This Fee must be
      paid publicly.

      Once an Attempt to Democratise a Proposal has been made, until
      the end of the Proposal's Voting Period, any Player may publicly
      transfer any number of VEs to the Bank with a clear, unambiguous
      statement that this transfer is made solely for the purpose of
      Democratising the Proposal, or solely for the purpose of keeping
      the Proposal Ordinary.

      At the end of the Voting Period, Democratisation succeeds if at
      least as many VEs have been publicly transferred to the Bank for
      Democratisating the Proposal as for keeping the Proposal
      Ordinary.  The Assessor shall announce as soon as possible after
      the end of the Voting Period whether or not Democratisation of
      that Proposal has succeeded.

      If Democratisation does not succeed, the Voting Period is
      considered to have ended as usual.  The Attempt does not in any
      way modify the Proposal in question.

      If Democratisation succeeds, the Proposal becomes a Democratic
      Proposal, and all Votes thus far cast on the Proposal are
      cancelled.  The Voting Period for that Proposal is considered
      not to have ended (except for the purposes of this Attempt to
      Democratise), and is extended to end seven days after the
      Assessor's announcement that Democratisation has succeeded.

      The Actual Voting Entitlement Circulation Level (AVECL) is the

      Entitlements owned by the Bank which have been auctioned off to
      Winning Bidders in prior Voting Entitlement Auctions but not
      yet paid for.

      The Voting Entitlement Surplus is the difference between the
      IVECL and the AVECL; if the AVECL is greater than the IVECL,
      the Voting Entitlement Surplus is zero.

      Whenever it occurs that the Voting Entitlement Surplus is
      positive and no Auction of Voting Entitlements is already in
      progress, the Assessor shall auction off the surplus Voting
      Entitlements. The items to be auctioned are lots of 0.1 VEs; the
      number of items is equal to the Voting Entitlement Surplus
      multiplied by 10, rounded down to the nearest integer.  The
      Auctioneer shall be the Assessor, and the Auction shall be

      The Oligarchy is a set of six positions which are filled by
      Players, who are called Oligarchs. No Player may ever occupy
      more than one position in the Oligarchy at any one time. A
      position is vacant if and only if it is not occupied; hence
      there is a vacancy in the Oligarchy only when there are fewer
      than six Oligarchs.

      There are three ranks within the Oligarchy, termed High, Middle,
      and Low. There are at most one High Oligarch and at most two
      Middle Oligarchs. There may be as many as six Low Oligarchs, but
      the normal number is three.

      An Oligarch may resign eir position in the Oligarchy by
      publicly announcing e does so. Upon such an announcement, e
      ceases to be an Oligarch and eir position becomes vacant.

      from the Oligarchy as soon as possible.

      Whenever an Auction is conducted to fill a position or positions
      in the Oligarchy, the standard Auction procedure is used, with
      the following additions and exceptions:

      (a) Auction Currency: the Auction Currency is Stems.

      (b) Bidders: Only Politicians may bid. The Speaker, the
          Speaker-Elect, all Zombies, and all Oligarchs may not bid.

      (c) If a bidder ceases to be a Player, goes On Hold, or becomes
          a Zombie, an Oligarch, the Speaker or the Speaker-Elect
          during the Auction, then all eir bids in the Auction are
          cancelled.

      (d) Winning bids: when the Auctions ends, the winning bids are
          the N largest uncancelled bids made by different Players
          who are not Oligarchs, where N is the number of positions
          being Auctioned.

      (e) Defaulting: a winning bidder has one week from the time e
          is billed by the Auctioneer for eir winning bid in which to
          pay the bill. If the bill remains unpaid for more than one
          week, then the winning bidder is considered to have
          defaulted. In that case, the Auctioneer shall forgive the
          debt and penalise the defaulting bidder 2 Blots.

      A position in the Oligarchy is pending if the position is
      vacant, an Auction has been held for that position and a winning
      bidder determined, and the winning bidder has not defaulted.

      When a winning bidder pays the bill for eir winning bid in the
      Auction, e becomes a Low Oligarch, provided the position is
      pending.

Rule 1937/6 (Power=2)
Distributing Positions in the Oligarchy

      When there are six Oligarchs and a number of Low Oligarchs other
      than three, the Oligarchy is "abnormally distributed", and an
      Oligarchy selection takes place as set out below.

      After a Player has become an Oligarch, or an Oligarch has
      changed rank, then if the Oligarchy is abnormally distributed,
      the Grand Warden of the Oligarchy shall, within three days,
      publish a list of the Oligarchs and their ranks, identifying
      those Players who are required to make the selection, and the
      set of Players from whom the selection is to be made. Failure to
      do so is the Class 1 Infraction of Oligardiness, which may be
      reported by any Player. However, if the Oligarchy selection
      occurs before the GWoTO publishes the list, the GWoTO is
      relieved of eir obligation to publish it.

      Whenever there are six Oligarchs, and no High Oligarch, the Low
      Oligarchs are permitted to select a Middle Oligarch to become
      the new High Oligarch. If there are no Middle Oligarchs, the Low
      Oligarchs shall instead select one of their own number to become
      the new High Oligarch. The immediately prior High Oligarch may
      not be selected as the new High Oligarch, if e is presently a
      Low Oligarch.

      Whenever there are six Oligarchs, a High Oligarch, and fewer
      than two Middle Oligarchs, the High Oligarch is permitted to
      select a Low Oligarch to become Middle Oligarch.

      When a selection from a set of one candidate is to be made, that
      candidate is selected immediately without any action by any
      Player.

      When a selection from a set of two or more candidates is to be
      made, and that selection is not to be made by the Speaker, the
      individual or individuals who are to make the selection shall
      announce their recommendations in the Public Forum. They are
      permitted to make their recommendations from the time the
      Oligarchy becomes abnormally distributed. They are required to
      make their recommendations within three days of the GWoTO's
      announcement. Recommendations, once made, cannot be changed.

      The selection occurs when one candidate has received the
      recommendation of a majority of those persons required to make a
      recommendation. If three days pass from the GWoTO's announcement
      without one candidate receiving the recommendation of a
      majority, then if there is a candidate which has received more
      recommendations than any other candidate, that candidate is
      selected; otherwise, the decision passes to the Speaker, and the
      Speaker shall make the selection.

      When a selection from a set of two or more candidates is to be
      made, and that selection is required to be made by the Speaker,
      the Speaker shall make eir selection within seven days by
      announcing it in the Public Forum. A Speaker who fails to make
      such a selection becomes Tainted. If, at the time a Player
      becomes Speaker, the previous Speaker was required to make a
      selection by this Rule and had not yet done so, the new Speaker
      shall be instead required to make the selection, and shall do so
      within seven days of becoming Speaker, or become Tainted.

      If a vacancy in the Oligarchy arises when the Oligarchy is
      abnormally distributed, then the Oligarchy selection and all
      requirements on Players arising from it are cancelled.

      Any Player required to make a recommendation by this Rule who
      fails to do so within the allotted time commits the Class 1
      Infraction of Oligardiness; this Infraction may be reported by
      any Player.

      At the beginning of a week, the Assessor shall determine each

      that Proposal, with the exception that no Player may vote on an
      Ordinary Proposal unless e is an Oligarch at the time e casts
      eir vote. An entity may cast its votes in any combination e

      Each Player is always Noisy, Quiet, or Silent, but never more
      than one of these.  Whenever a Player posts to a Public Forum,
      or a new Player registers, that Player is Noisy.

      Any Player who has not caused another Player to become Quiet
      within the last 24 hours can cause another Active Noisy Player
      to become Quiet by stating that e is doing so, and clearly
      identifying that Player, in a Public Forum.  If a Player has
      been Quiet continuously for two weeks, e becomes Silent.  If a
      Player has been Inactive continuously for two months, e becomes
      Silent.

      Any Player can make a Silent Player a Zombie by publicly
      alleging that the Silent Player has abandoned the game.  A
      Player has abandoned the game if and only if e is Silent.  As
      soon as possible after a public allegation that a Player has
      abandoned the game, the Registrar shall publicly confirm or deny
      that the Player is a Zombie.

      If a Speaker has abandoned the game, e commits the Class 15
      Crime of Speaker Abandonment, to be detected and reported by any
      Player.  E ceases to be Speaker, and the Speaker-Elect becomes
      Speaker.  The previous Speaker then becomes a Zombie.

      Attorney for that Zombie, unless the Rules withdraw it from
      em.

      The Registrar is the Recordkeepor of each Zombie.

      Whenever the Bank possesses a Zombie which is neither currently

      the debt arising therefore not yet paid, the Registrar shall
      initiate an Auction for the sale of that Zombie.

      All Auctions of Bank-owned Zombies shall be conducted as
      follows:
      (1) The Auctioneer shall be the Registrar.
      (2) The Auction Currency shall be Indulgences.
      (3) The Starting Price shall be number of Blots of the Zombie
          being Auctioned; or, if the Zombie has no Blots, one
          Indulgence.

      As soon as possible after the end of a Zombie Auction, the
      Registrar shall expunge any Blots the Zombie has, notifying the
      Herald of this action.

      If there are no winning bids for a Zombie during a Zombie
      Auction, that Zombie is deregistered.

      The Registrar is a Limited Executor of the Bank, with the
      authority to satisfy debts of Zombies owed by the Bank to its
      creditors.

Living Twice Shall Have Its Price

      O Agorans! Please hear my claim:
      A dark injustice mars our game.
      Though politics should not be easy
      For Zombie Masters life is breezy.
      The ordinary Player's stressed,
      The Zombie Master's triply bless'd
      With extra votes, and extra Roles
      And Stems enough to buy mink stoles.
      With all these perks, it seems they oughtta
      Pay more than one Indulgence per Quarter.

      And so, henceforth, for justices' sake,
      Let them this payment monthly make.
      The Registrar, who keeps our lists,
      For every Zombie that exists,
      Shall, at the end of each month passed, a
      Lone Indulgence bill the Master.
      And should this Upkeep be not paid
      Asap, the Master's disobeyed
      This Rule, and makes a wretched journey,
      Loses the Power of Attorney
      O'er that Zombie. More disaster!
      The Registrar shall bill the Master
      For the Zombie - but forgive
      The Upkeep debt, and thusly shrive
      The Master. That's the heavy price
      That must be paid for living twice.

      The Executor of an entity is a Player who is empowered by the
      Rules to act on behalf of that entity, as if e were that entity.

      Except when the Rules stipulate otherwise, a Player is eir own
      Executor.  Any other entity has an Executor only when the Rules
      specify either a Player or a means to designate a Player to be
      the Executor of that entity.

      Whenever a Player is acting on behalf of some entity of which e
      is the Executor other than emself, e must make it clear that e
      is doing so.  If such a Player fails to clearly indicate that e
      is acting as the Executor of some other entity, it shall be
      presumed that e is acting on eir own behalf.

      shall be known, for this Rule, as the Grantor.  The receiving
      Player shall be known, for this Rule, as the Holder.

      Power of Attorney is given by the Grantor publicly announcing
      such, naming the Holder e is giving the Power of Attorney to and
      the time period for which the Power of Attorney is given.  To be
      effective, this post must name a time that begins within the

      An Untainted Speaker may declare an Interested Proposal, which
      would otherwise be an Ordinary Proposal, for which the Voting
      Period has not yet concluded, and which has never been
      Contested, a Sane Proposal, With 3 Supporters.  This declaration
      may occur before the Voting Period commences; if it does, then
      this supported declaration turns the Proposal into a Democratic
      Proposal, and makes it Sane, requiring its Distribution Cost to
      be modified as required by other Rules.  If this supported
      declaration occurs during the Voting Period for the Proposal,
      then the Proposal is not modified unless at least one Papyrus is
      transferred to the Bank for this stated purpose by any Player.
      If this transfer occurs, then the Proposal becomes Democratic
      and Sane, all Votes already cast on the Proposal prior to the
      change are cancelled and its Voting Period is extended to end
      seven days after it became a Sane Proposal.

      Any Player may Contest an Interested Proposal, which would
      otherwise be an Ordinary Proposal and for which the Voting
      Period has not yet concluded, by sending a message to the Public
      Forum stating e is doing so.  If this Player is an Untainted
      Speaker, then the Proposal becomes Contested when e receives
      three Supporters.  If this Player is not an Untainted Speaker,
      then the Proposal becomes Contested if and only if e receives
      three Supporters and e publicly transfers 0.1VE to the Bank for
      the Contest.

      If a Proposal is Contested, any Player may publicly transfer any
      number of VEs to the Bank with a clear. unambiguous statement
      that this transfer is made either for or against the Contest.
      At the end of the Voting Period, the Contest is Succesful if
      strictly more VEs have been publicly transferred to the Bank for
      the Contest than have been publicly transferred to the Bank
      against the Contest.  If equal numbers of VEs have been publicly
      transferred to the Bank both for and against the Contest, then
      the Contest is Succesful only if the Proposal was Contested by
      an Untainted Speaker.

      If the Contest is not Succesful, the Voting Period is considered
      to have ended, and the Proposal is considered an ordinary
      Ordinary Proposal for any further actions.

      If the Contest is Succesful, then all Votes cast on the Proposal
      are cancelled.  The Proposal becomes a Democratic Proposal.  The
      Voting Period is considered not to have ended, and is extended a
      further seven days.

      The Assessor shall be required to determine whether or not the
      Contest is Succesful, and shall report any results of this
      determination as soon as possible.

      There are entities known as Organizations.  An entity is only an
      Organization when specifically designated as such by the Rules.
      Each Organizations consists of the following elements:

        i) An associated SLC.
       ii) A set of Players under the Jurisdiction of the associated
           SLC.
      iii) A Name that is unique to that Organization.

      No Organization exists that is not of a class of Organization
      that is defined in the Rules. The class of an Organization is
      specified when it is formed, and can not change thereafter.  If
      a class of Organization ever becomes undefined in the Rules,
      then all Organizations of that class are immediately dissolved.

      The Name of an Organization shall only be changed as specified
      by its SLC, or as specified in the Rules. If no other procedure
      is specified, the Name of any Organization shall change with the
      unanimous consent of all Players within the Jurisdiction of that
      Organization's SLC.

a9119 25
      There is a type of Application called an Application to Create
      an Organization (ACO).  A valid ACO, in order to have effect
      upon submission, must include the following:

        i) A defined class for the prospective Organization.
       ii) A unique Name for the prospective Organization.
      iii) An SLC for the prospective Organization.
       iv) All additional information required by the Rules governing
           the class of the prospective Organization.
        v) The signatures of at least as many distinct Players as
           required by the Rules governing the class of the
           prospective Organization, (minimum one) all of whom must be
           eligible to be members of the prospective Organization.

      A valid ACO is submitted by submitting it to the Notary or by
      publishing it.

      The effect of submitting a valid ACO is to create the
      prospective Organization, with the signatories as its Foundors.
      The Foundors then come under the Jurisdiction of that
      Organization's SLC.

      An ACO shall only be valid if its contents are not in conflict
      with this or other Rules.  An ACO that is not valid shall never
      be submitted.

      An Organization shall be dissolved only when the Rules or the
      Organization's SLC requires it.  An Organization shall be
      required to be dissolved whenever any of the following
      conditions is true:

        (i)  the Jurisdiction of its SLC becomes empty, and there is
             no provision for this to change;

       (ii)  the continued existence of the Organization would require
             that the Organization not have all of a legal
             Administrator, a legal Executor, and a legal Maintainer
             for its SLC; or

      (iii)  the SLC of the Organization requires the Organization to
             dissolve.

      Requirement to dissolve by condition (iii) is Voluntary.  Any
      other requirement to dissolve is Administrative.

      The Notary shall detect when an Administrative Dissolution takes
      place.

      Each Organization ceases to exist upon its dissolution.  Other
      Rules may require an Organization to dissolve under other
      circumstances.

Rule 1617/1 (Power=1)
Changing the Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC

      The Jurisdiction of an Organization's SLC shall only be changed
      in accordance with that SLC and with the Rules.  If there are no
      provisions for changing such an SLC, then the SLC can not be
      changed.

      No Player shall ever be made part of the Jurisdiction of the SLC
      of any Organization without eir consent.  This takes precedence
      over any Rule that would permit a Player to be involuntarily
      made part of the Jurisdiction of such a SLC.

      the debt from the time the Order is executed.

      Any entity Ordered to satisfy a debt who fails to do so within
      the time allowed by this Rule commits the Infraction of
      Persistent Indebtedness when that time first elapses, and
      further does so again every seven days after the time allowed
      has expired. Time during which the debt is disputed or the
      Order is stayed is not counted for the purpose of this Rule. If
      the Executor of the entity so Ordered is on Hold at the time
      the Order is issued, the time shall not begin to run until the
      Executor comes off Hold. These Infractions shall be reported by
      the creditor of the debt and carry a penalty of one Blot.

      No Order to satisfy a debt shall be enforced in any way after
      such time as the debt is satisfied, and the executor of any
      such Order shall vacate it as soon as the underlying debt is
      satisfied. If a debt becomes disputed, any Order to satisfy the
      disputed debt shall be stayed by its executor for the duration
      of the dispute. The Clerk of the Courts may stay, and a Judge
      stay or vacate, any Order which should properly be stayed or
      vacated (respectively) under this Rule in the event the
      executor of the Order neglects to do so.
