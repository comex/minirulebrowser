Create a new Mutable rule entitled "Rishonomic prostrates itself at the
feet of Agora" with text as follows:

      Rishonomic recognises that Agora is the one true master of all
      nomics.  Agora is the Overlord and Protector of Rishonomic by
      Platonic right.

      If the almighty Agora, in its infinite wisdom, should ever pass one
      of its Proposals that expresses a desire to modify this nomic's
      ruleset, then the modifications it wishes occur as soon as any
      player receives a copy of the Proposal from an Agora Player.
      When this happens, the Speaker shall humbly acknowledge the edict,
      thanking Agora for paying any attention to its most unworthy
      subject.

      If this rule is ever Mutable, it immediately transmutes itself
      to Immutable.  This rule cannot be repealed, amended, transmuted,
      retitled, pushed, shoved, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed,
      debriefed or numbered (or renumbered) by any means other than
      those required by this rule.  This rule takes precedence over all
      other rules.

This is a proto for a proposal to get adopted in Rishonomic.  It follows
the simplest and most general ideas expressed so far: establish a
very-difficult-to-modify rule, which contains language describing how
Risho is entirely subservient to Agora, and with a clause allowing Agora
to change Risho's ruleset at will.  No legislation is required within
Agora to match this.

This should be submitted as a Speedy proposal, which will limit the voting
period to 3 days.  It will require a 3/5 majority to pass; if there are
seven real Risho players, plus their Gnome vote, we will need at least
13 YES votes.  We should, however, consider the possibility that they
might realise the extent of the conspiracy, and get friends to register
and vote against the proposal.  If their Proposal 336 passes, we should
take advantage of it.
