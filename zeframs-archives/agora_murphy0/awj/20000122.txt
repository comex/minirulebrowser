-----------------

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Important Proposals" by t - Proposal 3960 rejected 1/11

  The Payroll Clerk may change the Exchange Convertor or Exchange
    Divisor (both Indices) to any positive Integer, Without 3 Objections.
  Initially, EC=80 and ED=35.

"Quorum Value" by harvel
  The term "Quorum Value" is defined as a Proposal's number of Votes
    required to meet Quorum.  The Promotor's distribution must include it.

"The Oligarchy" by Steve
  There is one High Oligarch, two Middle, and three Low.
  Oligarchs are disqualified for Speakerhood, non-Playerhood,
    Zombiehood, or Inactivity.
  Only Oligarchs vote on Ordinary Proposals.  Everyone may vote on
    Democratic Proposals.
  Normally, Proposals with AI<2 are Ordinary, and Proposals with AI>=2
    are Democratic.
  Prior to the end of an Ordinary Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker
    may make it a Democratic Proposal with three Supporters.  All votes
    on it are cancelled.
  Quorum for an Ordinary Proposal is three Oligarchs.
  The High Oligarch casts 3 votes, the Middle cast 2, and the Low cast
    1.  An Oligarch's votes are either all FOR, or all AGAINST; no
    ABSTAIN or Presence.  A Player who becomes an Oligarch during the
    Voting Period does not vote; a Player who changes rank casts votes
    according to the lower rank.
  Positions in the Oligarchy are auctioned with VTs.  The Speaker,
    Speaker-Elect, and current Oligarchs may not bid.  A Player's bids
    are cancelled if e goes On Hold.  A Player assumes a position when
    e pays eir winning bid for that position.
  Vacancies in the High or Middle Oligarchy are generally filled from
    the next lower rank, selected by the third rank.  Vacancies in the
    Low Oligarchy are Auctioned off by the High Oligarch.
  The High Oligarch becomes vacant at the beginning of each month.  The
    Speaker shall conduct an Auction four to ten days in advance.
  Upon a successful Rebellion, all positions in the Oligarchy become
    vacant.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1190 "The Private Payment Order executed in this message is
[TRUE]    executed for the purpose of paying for votes, within the
          meaning given to that phrase by the Judgement (sustained on
          Appeal) in CFJ 1183."
         12/25      Called by Steve
         12/26-1/9  Assigned to Michael, who defaults
         1/9-12     Assigned to elJefe, who Judges TRUE
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve intends to continue
           executing such Private Payment Orders until Wes pays for eir
           vote on Proposal 3857.  This can be interpreted (in at least
           a couple of ways) as having the indirect purpose of making
           Wes pay for that Vote, and CFJ 1183 sets precedent that Rule
           1824 recognizes indirect purposes.

CFJ 1191 "Wes is under no obligation to pay the above quoted PO and
[TRUE]    Steve's Private Order is therefore improperly executed."
         12/25      Called by Wes, who Moves to 1) vacate the PO, 2)
                      vacate any similar POs and Order Steve not to
                      issue any more
         12/26-1/9  Assigned to Murphy, who defaults
         1/9-12     Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE and grants
                      both Motions
         Caller's argument (summary):  Precedent of CFJ 1181.
         Judge's commentary (summary):  Precedent of CFJ 1172.

CFJ 1192 "Clerk of the Courts Wes violated Rule 1769 when he
[TRUE]    distributed the Official Judgement of CFJ 1183 on December
          26, 1999, during the Christmas Holiday designated by Rule
          1870."
         12/26     Called by Kelly, who Moves for a Formal Apology
         12/27-30  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
         1/2       Judgement Appealed by Wes, t, and lee
         1/2       Judicial Order appealed by Wes
         1/2       Appeal of Judicial Order assigned to Blob, Elysion,
                     and Wes
         1/6       Wes appoints harvel to replace em in Appeal of
                     Judgement; harvel consents
         1/13      Motion sustained
         1/14      Judgement sustained
         Judge's commentary (summary):  ASAP means "within 7 days", and
           a Holiday is never longer than 7 days, so it is always
           possible to do something according to the usual definition
           of ASAP without doing it during a Holiday.
         Reporter's commentary:  Wes had approximately a 29.5-hour
           window - between the submission of the Judgement of CFJ 1183
           and the beginning of the Christmas holiday - during which e
           could legally have published the Judgement.  What would
           Lindrum say about this?  Murphy has protoed a fix.
