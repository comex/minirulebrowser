ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"CFJ Streamlining" by Wes - Proposal 3962 adopted 1/19
   A CFJ's Deliberation Period explicitly begins with the CotC's
     announcement of a Judge.
   A Player fined for Judging Late becomes ineligible to Judge further
     CFJs, till e requests otherwise in the PF.
   A Player is fined for Judging a Bit Late even if e Judges or dismisses
     the CFJ before the CotC can apply the fine.
   A Judge ceases to be assigned to a CFJ if e becomes ineligible for
     any reason.
   Failing to grant or deny a Motion within a week is grounds for the CotC
     to Recuse and assign a new Judge.
   A Motion for a closed case whose Judge is no longer an Active Player
     is assigned to a new Judge.

"Cleanup with Quantifier Changes" by harvel - Proposal 3968 adopted 2/3

"Stare Decisis" by Blob - Proposal 3978 adopted 2/21
   The Clerk of the Courts shall publish the Stare Decisis monthly.  This is a
     list of the statement, date, and outcome (original and Appealed, if
     applicable) for all future CFJs, and optionally any past CFJs, except 
those
     e deems no longer relevant.

"Wins, Wins, Wins" by Wes - Proposal 3977 adopted 2/21
   Possessing at least 200 Points is a Win Condition, upon which all Points and
     Point POs are destroyed.

     Impeachment, Revolts, Proposals, Appealed Judgements, Patent Titles, and
     Degrees.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

     intersection.

   Amend Rule 1925 (Legislative Status) to assign a Status of Barred to
     Players with at least 15 Blots.

"Stem Conversion Rates" by t - Proposal 3971 rejected 2/7
   Each Basic Currency has an Exchange Rate (adjustable weekly by the
     Payroll Clerk, by up to 10% of the original value) that determines
     how much of that Currency one receives in exchange for a given
     amount of Stems.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Abandoned Proposals Drop Faster" by Wes
   Priority of Proposals still in the Queue drops by a minimum of 5 after each
     distribution.
   [This was mistakenly distributed as Proposal 3981.  It is not currently up
    for vote.]

"Agora Improvement: Fix Auctions NOW" by Elysion
   Require 72 (not 24) hours to elapse with no Bids before an Auction
     ends.

"Better Education Means Better Pay" by Atom and/or Sherlock - Proposal 3982

     each Office's Salary if the Officer possesses that Degree.

"Complete the Return" by Steve - Proposal 3976

"Dependent Actions" by harvel - Proposal 3965 presumably rejected
                                 Proposal 3973
   Combine Rules 1728 (Actions Without N Objections) and 1874 (Actions
     With N Supporters).

"Succession Reform" by Elysion - Proposal 3974
   "Arbiter of Succession" is no longer mentioned.
   The Order of Succession remains in effect until there is an Electee
     to the Office of Speaker-Elect.

"The MUQ of IATs Should Be 1, Dammit!" by t - Proposal 3975
   IATs have MUQ = 1 (not 0.01).

"The Oligarchy" by Steve - Proposal 3980
   There is one High Oligarch, two Middle, and three Low.
   Oligarchs are disqualified for Speakerhood, non-Playerhood,
     Zombiehood, or Inactivity.
   Only Oligarchs vote on Ordinary Proposals.  Everyone may vote on
     Democratic Proposals.
   Normally, Proposals with AI<2 are Ordinary, and Proposals with AI>=2
     are Democratic.
   Prior to the end of an Ordinary Proposal's Voting Period, the Speaker
     may make it a Democratic Proposal with three Supporters.  All votes
     on it are cancelled.
   Quorum for an Ordinary Proposal is three Oligarchs.
   The High Oligarch casts 3 votes, the Middle cast 2, and the Low cast
     1.  An Oligarch's votes are either all FOR, or all AGAINST; no
     ABSTAIN or Presence.  A Player who becomes an Oligarch during the
     Voting Period does not vote; a Player who changes rank casts votes
     according to the lower rank.
   Positions in the Oligarchy are auctioned with VTs.  The Speaker,
     Speaker-Elect, and current Oligarchs may not bid.  A Player's bids
     are cancelled if e goes On Hold.  A Player assumes a position when
     e pays eir winning bid for that position.
   Vacancies in the High or Middle Oligarchy are generally filled from
     the next lower rank, selected by the third rank.  Vacancies in the
     Low Oligarchy are Auctioned off by the High Oligarch.
   The High Oligarch becomes vacant at the beginning of each month.  The
     Speaker shall conduct an Auction four to ten days in advance.
   Upon a successful Rebellion, all positions in the Oligarchy become
     vacant.
   [Previous version was Proposal 3966 rejected 2/3]

"Voters and Legislators" by Peekee - Proposal 3972
   Legislative Status is abandoned.
   Players with >15 Blots are Denied.
   Players with >10 Blots are Mute.
   "Voting Entity" becomes "Voter".

PROTO-PROPOSALS

     defined in a single Rule.

"Clarify Destruction of Bank's Currency" by harvel
   The Executor of a Bank Currency may destroy units of that Currency

     Currency Bank to destroy its own holdings.)

"Currencies" by Kelly and/or Peekee
   Statements of transfer replace Transfer Orders.
   Debts replace Payment Orders.
   Creditors may Order partial or full payment of debts.

   The Mtunza (a new Officer) is Mintor and Recordkeepor of all types of Kitu.
   Kitu are created only when the Rules grant them to a Player, and may be used
     only as the Rules specifically require or allow.

"Nomic Entity Reform" by harvel
   "Nomic Entity" is eliminated from the Rules.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1193 "The Payment Orders, designated avt582 through avt593, and issued by t
[FALSE]   in a message dated Thu, 20 Jan 2000 15:51:29 +0200 (EET), are
           invalid."
          2/2      Called by Chuck
          2/6-13   Assigned to Harlequin, who defaults
          2/14-15  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          2/15-16  Appealed by lee, t, and Steve
          2/16     Appeal assigned to Murphy, Blob, and harvel
          2/20     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
          2/22     harvel moves to overturn and reassign
          2/23     Murphy is replaced by Steve on the Board
          2/23     Steve moves to overturn and reassign
          2/24-26  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The Payment Orders in question 
attempted
            to bill, in unsigned VTs, for Votes cast on the batch of Proposals
            that changed VTs to be unsigned again.  The Statement questions
            whether Rule 1442/22's requirement of Vote billing can be triggered
            by the end of Voting Periods that preceded its existence.  Game
            Custom is strongly in favor of allowing amendments to Vote billing
            to affect billing for Votes on the Proposals responsible for those
            amendments.
          Justiciar Blob's argument (summary):  The initial attempt to bill
            signed VTs for Voting on the Proposals in question was made in the
            same message announcing their adoption, but later in that message.
            Per Rule 1527, they were thus issued after the Proposals were
            adopted, and they were indeed invalid.  Judge Peekee's is 
incomplete
            and starts off wrong, but this does not necessarily indicate the
            truth of the Statement, hence the motion to reassign.
          Judge Palnatoke's argument (summary):  The requirement to bill for
            Voting is part of Rule 1442 (an entity), and remains continuous to
            the maximum extent possible.

CFJ 1194 "A breach of the Rules in Agora is considered (By Agora) to be
[TRUE]    illegal."
          2/13  t Judges TRUE

CFJ 1195 "Doing what is explicitly prohibited (and possibly penalized) by the
[DISMISS] Rules is a breach of the Rules, however if something is not
           prohibited but just penalized by the Rules then doing it is not a
           breach of the Rules but merely part of the Agora."
          2/13     Called by Peekee
          2/13-17  Assigned to Wes, who DISMISSes the CFJ
          Judge's argument (summary):  Penalizing an action implicitly 
prohibits
            it.  Furthermore, defining the difference between an action with a
            penalty (such as an Infraction) and an action with a non-penalty
            cost (such as Proposal Voting, which generally costs VTs) is beyond
            the scope of this CFJ.

CFJ 1196 "On Fri, 11 Feb 2000 23:39:06 +0800, [Anthony] made a legitimate
[TRUE]    proposal for a rule change."
          2/14  Sherlock Judges TRUE

CFJ 1197 "Wes violated Rule 1809 when he failed to stay the Payment Order
[FALSE]   denominated as avt583 when Chuck called the CFJ assigned the number
Appealed  1193."
          2/23     Called by Kelly
          2/24-26  Assigned to Anthony, who Judges FALSE
          2/26     Appealed by harvel, lee, and Steve
          Judge's argument (summary):  Wes was not Clerk of the Courts on
            February 2, when CFJ 1193 was called.  Clerk of the Courts harvel
            may have made two errors:  assigning CFJ 1193 to Harlequin (on
            February 6) without staying avt583, and reassigning CFJ to Peekee
            (on February 14) without confirming a stay on avt583.
          Editor's note:  Wes *was* Clerk of the Courts (but not its 
Electee) on
            February 2, hence the call for Appeal.

CFJ 1198 "Peekee violated Rule 1809 when he failed to vacate the Payment
           Order denominate as avt583 when he determined, in the course of
           Judging CFJ 1193, that the Order in question was improperly
           issued."
          2/23  Called by Kelly
          2/25  Assigned to Steve
          Editor's commentary:  Rule 1830 (No Compulsion of Judges) attempts to
            require the dismissal of this CFJ.  See CFJ 1199.
