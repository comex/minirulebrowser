PROPOSALS
---------

5/20-31  Swann, Macross, and others issue and amend dozens of Orders
           prohibiting various other players from performing various
           sorts of Order-related acts.  Swann also protoes several
           versions of "Order Repair" and stated that, when e Proposes
           it, e plans to Order all Players to vote FOR it and refrain
           from voting AGAINST it.  ("Order Repair" will, of course,
           give Swann and Macross each a Win and Patent Title, then
           close the loophole.)

5/20  Crito admits a COE regarding the title of Proposal 3749, but
        claims that it is "The Levers of Monetary Policy"; it is
        actually "More Fun with Priority".

        Cygneus).

        adopted:
          3747 [Steve] The Levers of Monetary Policy

      Michael Proposes "Repeal the Archivist".

5/23  Swann protoes "Make Strategic Criminal Actions Truly Illegal".

5/26  Crito admits a COE and gives the correct title of Proposal 3749
        ("More Fun with Priority").

        3752 [Crito]  Discard Disinterest
        3753 [Murphy] Plot Repair
        3754 [Steve]  Reinstate unemployment benefits

      The Repeal-O-Matic Proposes the repeal of Rule 1730 (Delayed

          sense of Rule 1513 and as such is subject to the limitations
          set forth in that Rule, and in particular that Orders derive
          coercive power from some Rules and that the Rules take
