ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Discarding the Chaff" by Wes - Proposal 3957 adopted 12/27
  Repeal Rule 1643 (Statements of Policy).

"Fix Debt Voting" by Steve - Proposal 3959 adopted 12/27
  Reword Rules 1823 and 1824 to state that Voting POs are to bill for
    Votes, not pay for Votes.

"Fix Rule 1886" by Murphy - Proposal 3958 adopted 12/27
  Replace "pay" with "pay out to" in Rule 1886 (Returning to Life).

"Issues" by harvel - Proposal 3956 adopted 12/27
  An Issue is a Proposal, Election, or Referendum.  This new term is
    used to simplify some Rules.
  Rule 879 (Quorum) explicitly allows other Rules to define ways for
    Players to count towards Proposal Quorum without Voting.

[There is an outstanding claim that the Voting Periods of these
 Proposals is extended till 1/1 due to the Christmas Holiday.  This
 will probably not prevent their eventual adoption, though.]

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Clean Up Probate.  Again." by Murphy
  Conditions for entering Probate are bulleted.
  Payment Orders don't trigger Probate unless outstanding.
  Rule 1757 (Implementation of Probate Plans), long obsolete, is repealed.

"Oligarchs" by Michael
  There are six Oligarchs:  one at level 3, two at level 2, and three
    at level 1.
  Each Oligarch has Proposal Votes equal to eir level.  No one else may
    Vote on Proposals.
  Each month:
    The level 3 Oligarch is removed.
    A level 2 Oligarch is promoted by level 1 vote.
    A level 1 Oligarch is promoted by the new level 3 Oligarch.
    An Auction or Election fills the now-vacant level 1 Oligarch spot.
  The Speaker may declare a Proposal Open (everyone may vote on it),
    but may never be an Oligarch.

"CFJ Streamlining" by Wes
  A CFJ's Deliberation Period explicitly begins with the CotC's
    announcement of a Judge.
  A Player fined for Judging Late becomes ineligible to Judge further
    CFJs, till e requests otherwise in the PF.
  A Player is fined for Judging a Bit Late even if e Judges or dismisses
    the CFJ before the CotC can apply the fine.
  A Judge ceases to be assigned to a CFJ if e becomes ineligible for
    any reason.
  Failing to grant or deny a Motion within a week is grounds for the CotC
    to Recuse and assign a new Judge.
  A Motion for a closed case whose Judge is no longer an Active Player
    is assigned to a new Judge.

"Wins, Wins, Wins" by Wes
  Points are a Currency, transferred only when the Rules explicitly allow
    or require that Points be Awarded or Penalized.
  Points are transferred only if someone points out the relevant event
    and Rule within 7 days.
  Having at least 200 Points is a Win Condition, upon which all Points
    are destroyed and all Point POs are vacated.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1190 "The Private Payment Order executed in this message is
          executed for the purpose of paying for votes, within the
          meaning given to that phrase by the Judgement (sustained on
          Appeal) in CFJ 1183."
         12/25  Called by Steve
         12/26  Assigned to Michael
         Caller's argument (summary):  Steve intends to continue
           executing such Private Payment Orders until Wes pays for eir
           vote on Proposal 3857.  This can be interpreted (in at least
           a couple of ways) as having the indirect purpose of making
           Wes pay for that Vote, and CFJ 1183 sets precedent that Rule
           1824 recognizes indirect purposes.

CFJ 1192 "Clerk of the Courts Wes violated Rule 1769 when he
[TRUE]    distributed the Official Judgement of CFJ 1183 on December
          26, 1999, during the Christmas Holiday designated by Rule
          1870."
         12/26     Called by Kelly
         12/27-30  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE
         Judge's commentary (summary):  ASAP means "within 7 days", and
           a Holiday is never longer than 7 days, so it is always
           possible to do something according to the usual definition
           of ASAP without doing it during a Holiday.
         Reporter's commentary:  That doesn't mean it's easy.  If
           something occurs one hour before a 7-day Holiday, and you
           must react to it ASAP but not during a Holiday, then you can
           only react to it during that one-hour time period between
           the event and the start of the Holiday.  I wonder what
           Lindrum would have to say about this.
