      "If two more of the 4 currently Rebellious Players (Harlequin,
       Sherlock, Morendil and Time Agent) will agree to become Abiding,
       so pushing the prospect of another Revolt further into the
       distance, then I will use my Speaker's Right to Call Elections
       to free up some of the Offices held by the Threat, namely,
       Scorekeepor, Commander-in-Chief and Archivist.  Bearing in mind
       that Crito will soon be Elected Accountor (General Chaos is not
       really contesting the Election), this will reduce the number of
       Offices held by the Threat from 10 to 6, basically restoring
       the political balance."

      Sherlock becomes Abiding.

      Chuck becomes Rebellious.

3/22  Sherlock becomes Rebellious.

3/24  Blob becomes Rebellious.


OTHER
-----

3/27  elJefe analyzes the latest results of Proposal 3710's adoption,
        if it was adopted:  "Threat Trombones" was raised to Power=4,
        so Threat Trombone #5 raised the Monument Rule to Power=7
        (regardless of Rules 1692 and 1322 attempting to prevent it
        from doing so).  Rule 1322 then prevents Rule 1692 from
        reducing the Monument Rule to Power=4, and prevents Chuck's
        Counter-Scam (involving instruments of at most Power=5) from
        repealing it.
