   Change "Payment Order" to "debt" in Rule 1936 (Auctioning Positions in the
     Oligarchy).

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Fix Rule 1614" by harvel - Proposal 4064 failed quorum 9/4
                           - Proposal 4068 failed quorum 9/11

   Repeal Rules 1943 (Continuity of the Bank) and 1949 (Continuity of Debt),
     left over from the conversion from Payment Orders to Debts.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee - Proposal 4055 failed quorum 8/20
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.

"Rule cleanup" by Taral - Proposal 4063 failed quorum 9/4
                         - Proposal 4070 failed quorum 9/11
   Repeal Rule 1927 (Bank Currency Creation).

"The Court of Equity" by Taral - Proposal 4067 failed quorum 9/10
   Debts found invalid by CFJ are cancelled.
   Reporting a known-invalid debt is the Class 10 Crime of Extortion.
   Rule 1742 (Agreements Between Players) is updated from Payment Order
     style language to Debt style language.
   Fees are changed from up-front costs to debts.
   Private Orders are explicitly made valid unless specified otherwise,
     but are prohibited from requiring or restricting Property transfer
     except to satisfy debts of the entity being Ordered.

"What is Public?" by Wes - Proposal 4066 rejected 9/4
   Any communication sent to a PF is deemed to have been sent to all Players.
   Any communication sent to a DF (Discussion Forum) is deemed not to have
     been sent to all Players.
   Any communication sent to all Players is deemed to have been made Publicly.
   This collects all PF timing requirements into a single place.
   Throughout the rest of the Ruleset, requirements to send something to the
     PF are replaced with requirements to do them Publicly.
   Oh, and "ProSiRuP is Marvy" is hidden in the middle of the dreary part of
     the Proposal.  (Agora's first known instance of scam by obscurity occurred
     in early 1997:  "Murphy Wins" was embedded in a Proposal assigning names
     to then-nameless Crimes/Infractions, to avoid ambiguity of Double
     Jeopardy.)

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Clean Up R408" by Steve
   Infraction of Judging Late occurs only if no Judgement was delivered
     within fourteen days.

"Electees become Office-holders" by Murphy

"Remove some anomalous references" by Steve
   Amend Rule 1664 (Rebellion) as intended by "Improved Officer Rules" (which

   The High Oligarch is not rotated out if there were any vacancies in
     the Oligarchy during the past week.

"Votes over Points" by Taral

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Budgeted Stipends" by Elysion
   The Winners' Stipend is part of the Treasuror's Budget, rather than being
     fixed at half the Basic Officer Salary.

"Entitlement Factors" by Peekee
   For a Currency with an Entitlement Factor:
     Entitlement Factor is a positive amount of Currency per Player.
     Ideal Circulation Level = number of Players * Entitlement Factor, rounded
       up to nearest MUQ.
     Actual Circulation Level = non-Bank holdings, plus Bank holdings won in
       Auction but not yet paid for.
     Circulation Level Surplus = max(0, ICL - ACL).  This amount shall be
       Auctioned at the beginning of each month, in the Bidding Currency for
       that Currency.
   For Indulgences:
     ICL = number of Players + number of Player Blots.
     Bidding Currency = IATs.
   For Papyri:
     Entitlement Factor = 0.25 to 4, contained in Promotor's Budget.
     Bidding Currency = P-Notes.
     Promotor's Budget also contains Quorum Repayment (0 to 1 Papyri, paid out
       to the author of a Proposal that fails Quorum).
   For VEs:
     Entitlement Factor = 1.
     Bidding Currency = VTs.

"Fix Kudos and Remove a Rule" by Elysion
   Kudos are no longer Property.
   Definition of Shogun is moved to Rule 1923 (Defined Unique Patent Titles).

"Forced-Ordinary/Democratic Proposals" by Peekee
   A Forced-Ordinary Proposal must be Ordinary and have AI=1.  It has
     Distribution Cost +1.  It can never be made Democratic.
   A Forced-Democratic Proposal has Priority Cost +1.  It is Democratic,
     regardless of AI.

"Groups as Legislators" by Peekee
   Each Group with at least three Members is a Legislator.

"Judicial Cleanup" by Peekee
   A matter (not a "dispute") may be resolved by CFJ.
   CotC may withdraw a CFJ without a single clearly identifiable statement.
   Caller's ability to Bar Players merged into Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement).
   Definitions of Open/Closed moved to Rule 991 (Invoking Judgement).
   CotC may withdraw a trivial Open CFJ at the caller's request.
   CFJs may be submitted to (not "filed with") the Justiciar.
   CotC may withdraw (not "dismiss") an Excess CFJ.
   Entities with the same Executor as a CFJ's Caller are barred with the same
     severity as the Caller emself.
   Rule 698 (Always an Eligible Judge) works by restoring eligiblity, rather
     than changing the entire general definition of who is eligible.
   Players Barred by the Caller are restored eligibility at the same time as
     Inactive Players, rather than afterward.
   CotC may recuse a Judge who goes On Hold.
   Rule 1756 ("Delinquent Judges", requiring the CotC to recuse a delinquent
     Judge upon the request of two Players) is repealed, on the assumption that
     Rule 408 ("Requirement to Judge or Dismiss", requiring the CotC to recuse
     a Judge who is a week late) is sufficient.
   Judges who Judge a Bit Late still get paid.
   Judges may only dismiss CFJs to which they are assigned.
   The general category "lacks standing" is repealed.
   When a Judgement or Dismissal is overturned, the Judge is billed the current
     Judicial Salary (which may have changed since e was paid).
   CotC may withdraw a CFJ alleging that a Judge has failed to perform a
     judicial duty.
   A Justice may not appoint a replacement after submitting a determination.
   Dismissal and withdrawal may be Appealed.
   The Board of Appeal's decision is final as soon as two Justices make the 
same
     determination.
   The Board are explicitly allowed to overturn an incompletely considered
     Judgement, even if unsure that the final result is incorrect.
   On reassignment, the new Judge is not prohibited from making the same
     Judgement for the same reasons.

"Quarterly Auction of Voting Entitlements" by Steve
   At the beginning of each quarter, all VEs are destroyed, and the Assessor
     shall mint and Auction as many VEs as there are Players.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.  However, before transferring a
     type of Property according to an entity's Will, all the entity's
     debts for that type of Property at the time of Abandoning must first
     be satisfied.

"Say Something" by Taral
   When the Voting Period of a Proposal ends, any Active Player eligible
     to Vote on it commits the Infraction of Failure to Vote if e did not
     Vote or declare Presence on any Proposal for the past four weeks.
   For Oligarchs, the Infraction is Oligarch Lethargy, the required action
     is to Vote FOR or AGAINST an Ordinary Proposal, and the limit is two
     weeks.

"Secret, Unknown and Hidden Proposals" by Peekee
   A Secret Proposal has Distribution Cost +0.5.  It may be made Distributable
     by private request to the Promotor.  When it leaves the Pool, Distribution
     Cost is billed to the first Player to request it become Distributable.  If
     it re-enters the Pool, that debt is forgiven.
   An Unknown Proposal has Distribution Cost +0.5.  It may be submitted by
     private message to the Promotor, and its text is Secret while in the Pool.
   A Hidden Proposal has Distribution Cost +1.  All information about a Hidden
     Proposal is Secret while it is in the Pool, but the Promotor may reveal
     how many Hidden Proposals are in the Pool.
   Each of these things must be explicitly stated in the message in which the
     Proposal is submitted.

"Urgent Distribution" by Taral
   A Proposal may be declared Urgent for free.
   Urgent Proposals may be distributed immediately.
   With Support, one may order the Promotor to distribute an Urgent
     Proposal within five days.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1237  "The Order issued by Chuck on Sun, 23 Jul 2000 17:17:02 -0500
[TRUE]     was valid."
           7/25       Called by Taral
           7/26-27    Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
           7/30       Taral moves that Chuck be Ordered to pay the Bank 24
                        P-Notes, the amount that Chuck received as a result
                        of the Order in question.
           7/30       Oerjan grants the motion
           7/30-8/19  Appealed by Murphy, Chuck, Steve, and Oerjan
           8/20       Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Wes
           8/20       Taral (ineligible because e is the Caller) replaced
                        by Steve
           8/20       Wes moves to overturn and reassign
           8/21       Chuck (allegedly ineligible because e made emself
                        ineligible to Judge this CFJ on 8/1; see CFJ xxxx)
                        allegedly replaced by Murphy
           8/24       Steve moves to overturn and reverse
           8/24       Improperly reassigned to Elysion (Wes's and Steve's
                        motions were noted, but Taral's attempted motion
                        on 8/20 should have been ignored)
           8/30       Murphy recused and replaced by Kelly
           9/2        Kelly moves to overturn and reassign
           9/2-9/9    Reassigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE
           Caller's argument for FALSE (summary):  Chuck transferred some
             P-Notes for the purpose of paying a Fee.  The P-Note payment
             succeeded, but the Fee payment failed.  The Rules do not
             require that Players be reimbursed for failed Fee payments.
             Rule 1796 permits the validity of Chuck's Order to be proven
             by CFJ only if its execution is required by the Rules.
           Counterargument:  Rule 1796 also permits the validity of the
             Order to be proven by CFJ if its execution is "permitted in"
             the circumstances existing when it was executed; and the Rules
             do not prohibit or regulate the creation of a Private Order,
             thus such creation is permitted by Rule 101.
           Justice Steve's argument (summary):  Rule 101's permission is
             not turned off by the regulation of Orders generally.  It *is*
             turned off by the regulation of Private Orders specifically, by
             Rule 1808.  But the execution of Private Orders is permitted by
             Rules 1794 and 1808 directly, without involving Rule 101.
           Concurring opinion (summary):  Rule 1808 does not regulate any
             aspect of Private Orders, except to state that an attempt to
             execute one is ineffectual unless sent to the Player at whom
             the Order is directed.

CFJ 1240  "Kelly is not the Judge of CFJ 1234."
[TRUE]    8/8      Called by Kelly
           8/9-14   Assigned to t, who Judges FALSE
           8/14-17  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, Kelly, Taral, Wes, and Peekee
           8/15     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Wes
           8/18     Chuck makes emself ineligible
           8/20     Taral moves to overturn and reassign
           8/20     Wes moves to overturn and reassign
           8/30     Chuck recused and replaced by Blob
           8/30     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
           9/7      Andre Judges TRUE
           9/10     Appealed by Steve
           9/14     Steve seeks co-Sponsor for Dissenting Opinion
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 408 says that Judge become
             ineligible seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period,
             and does not explicitly restrict that clause to cases in which
             the Judge fails to deliver Judgement by that time.
           Counterargument (summary):  But it may implicitly restrict that
             clause to such cases.

CFJ 1243  "Chuck is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
[TRUE]     1237."
Appealed  8/21     Called by Steve
           8/22-24  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
           8/25-26  Appealed by Andre, Crito, harvel, Oerjan, and Kelly
           8/25     Andre creates and signs an Application to Submit an
                      Opinion, to force the official recording of eir
                      Dissenting Opinion
           8/25     Crito signs Andre's Application
           8/27     harvel and Steve sign Andre's Application
           8/28     Andre submits and executes eir Application
           8/30     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Andre
           9/22     Chuck, Taral, and Andre dismissed from Board; t, Kelly, and
                      Blob assigned to Board
           Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck made emself ineligible to Judge
             CFJ 1237 on August 1.  When CFJ was called, Chuck was ineligible
             only due to Rule 1871, which does not affect the Board.  However,
             there may be some Rules that use "Judge" to include Justices too.
           Counterargument (summary):  No, there aren't.  The Rules restrict
             the correctness of Judges and Judgements; they restrict Justices
             only to decide whether the Judge did what e should have.
           Judge's concurring opinion (summary):  The object of "it" in Rule
             911's "when it was called" is "the Appeal".
           Counterargument (summary):  No, the object is "the CFJ".  The time
             that an Appeal is called is undefined anyway, though it would
             presumably be the earliest time at which there exist sufficient
             insistences on Appeal.  Rule 541 iii) and iv) use "the matter
             the Board is to consider" - a phrase similar to one in Rule 911
             - in apparently inconsistent ways, but this is resolved if the
             phrase is interpreted as "the Judicial process regarding a given
             CFJ".  Transferring that interpretation to the context of Rule
             911, the only sensible interpretation of "when a Judicial process
             was called" is "when the original CFJ was called".

CFJ 1245  "The Speaker has failed to initiate an Election for the Office of
[FALSE]    Grand Warden of the Oligarchy as required by the Rules."
           8/24      Called by Taral
           8/24-9/1  Assigned to Chuck, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  GWotO has no Electee, so the Rule "The
             Order of Temporary Succession" applies.
           Judge's counterargument (summary):  This requirement has no implicit
             time limit.  If it has an implicit time limit, then that limit
             ought to be no stricter than ASAP's one week, whereas the CFJ was
             called less than four days after the requirement began to exist.

CFJ 1246  "Peekee has paid a Fee of 10 Stems since the 15th of September this
            year."
           9/19  Called by Peekee
           9/19  Blob makes emself ineligible
           9/20  Peekee bars Crito
           9/21  Taral makes emself ineligible

CFJ 1247  "t's Order dated Wed, 20 Sep 2000 22:50:26 +0300 was improperly
            executed."
           9/20  Called by Taral
           Circumstances:  t's first version of "Stable Oligarchy" lacked
             sufficient Power, due to an error in the Ruleset.  t re-submitted
             it with appropriate Power, and ordered (Rulekeepor and Promotor)
             Chuck to make it Distributable.

OTHER
-----

9/1   Auction begins for 7 Indulgences.

       Chuck returns from an approximately four-week absence (due to a
         combination of several external circumstances) and becomes Noisy.

       Rulekeepor Chuck admits Kelly's COE to the effect that Rule 1051
         (The Rulekeepor) still requires the weekly posting of the Short
         Logical Ruleset, and the monthly posting of the Full Logical
         Ruleset.

       Rulekeepor Chuck admits Taral's COEs on the Amendment Numbers of
         three Rules in the Full Logical Ruleset.

9/2   Peekee comes Off Hold.

9/4   Steve attempts to make the Zombies Silent.  This fails because
         they were Silent all along.

9/9   Wes goes On Hold.

9/12  Promotor Taral announces unofficial intent to Auction 9 or 11 Papyri.

9/14  Herald Elysion announces eir intent to remove Historical Significance

         Zeitgeist.

       Wes comes Off Hold.

9/15  Oerjan and Palnatoke object to the removal of Historical Significance.

9/16  Peekee transfers 10 Stems to the Bank for the purpose of "Paying a Fee
         of 10 Stems", then states sixty times "I would like to inform the
         relevant Offices that I wish to obtain 10 IATs".  It is generally
         agreed that each of these wishes creates a separate Fee, only one of
         which may be paid by the transfer.  (Rules 1941, 1912)  See CFJ 1246.

       Kelly retorts in a-d:
         "I would like to inform the relevant Officers that I have repealed the
          entire Ruleset.  New Rules will follow shortly."

       Wes replies:

TIPJAR CONCEPTS
---------------

Can be made 100% usable via e-mail.

TipJar would deem Currency to be created or destroyed in the possession
   of only one entity (call it the Sink).  Everything else is transfers;
   creation is a transfer from the Sink, destruction is a transfer to
   the Sink.

Liaison can be allowed to execute third-party transfers (e.g. Power of
   Attorney, Zombies).

Can produce transaction detail reports.

Must not allow any account to go negative.

Allows installation of new Liaison (by TipJar's operators) if old one
   disappears.

Should allow e-mail addresses to be changed.

Should allow multiple accounts per e-mail addresses (e.g. Organizations,
   Bank).  Workaround:  There are many ways to pick up an extra address.


ERRATA
------

Taral did not make any Zombies Quiet on 8/20, as they have all been Silent
   since becoming Zombies (and only a Noisy Player may become Quiet).
