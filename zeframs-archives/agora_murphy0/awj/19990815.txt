-------------------

CFJ 1150  "One, or both, of the following assertions are true, to wit, 
[TRUE]     firstly, that Elysion is guilty of Tardiness in not
Appealed   reporting to Steve regarding the ex-Player Morendil's
           Denaria holdings within one week of Steve being assigned as
           Trustee for Morendil, or secondly, that Steve is guilty of
           Tardiness in not posting to the Public Forum a Probate Plan
           for Morendil within one week of having received from all
           extant Recordkeepors reports regarding Morendil's holdings
           in the Currencies for which they were respectively
           Recordkeepors, the transmission of said reports being
           mandated by Steve's assignment as Trustee for Morendil."
          8/1    Called by Morendil
          8/3-9  Assigned to Michael, who Judges TRUE
          8/9    Appealed by Elysion, Michael, and Crito
          8/10   Appeal assigned to Chuck, Kolja A., and Wes

CFJ 1151  "R.1896 (c) (iii) implicitly designates a Player who is a 
[FALSE]    Legislator to temporarily be a Voting Entity after having 
           satisfied certain conditions (eg, transferring 6 Amoeba to 
           the Bank)."
          8/3     Called by harvel
          8/3-15  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1896 conflicts with Rules
            206 and 1889, both of which take precedence over it.

CFJ 1155  "Honourary Players of Agora are considered Registered Players
           of Agora by entities which exist entirely outside the Agora
           Nomic Rules."
          8/8   Called by The Colonel
          8/10  Assigned to Michael
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 869 should be interpreted
