OFFICES
-------

10/17  Notary Election:  Nominees are Murphy and Kolja A.  Voting begins.

       Speaker-Elect Election:  No Nominees.  New Election begins.

10/18  Registrar Election:  Murphy announces the result of the Election e
         initiated while Speaker, namely that Michael won it.  Whether
         effective or not, this announcement is probably moot, since Speaker
         Morendil has already initiated a new Election.
