CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1147  "It must always be possible to make arbitrary modifications
[TRUE]     to the ruleset by some combination of player actions, even
           if Rule 114 is repealed."
          7/31  Called by Palnatoke
          8/3   Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE
          8/3   Appealed by Blob
          Caller's argument (summary):  The premise of this statement
            is that "always" implies that Rule 114's requirement would
            survive its repeal.

CFJ 1148  "Midnight of a given day is the midnight at 00:00 hours of
[TRUE]     that day."
          7/31  Called by Palnatoke
          8/3   Assigned to harvel, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  The refutation of this
            statement is that midnight of a given day is 24:00 hours of
            that day.

CFJ 1149  "If entity X submits a Transfer Order satisfying a Payment
[TRUE]     Order naming another entity Y as payor, entity Y will commit
           the Crime of Contempt by Inaction if entity Y does not
           submit the Transfer Order specifically required by the
           Payment Order."
          7/31   Called by Elysion
          8/3-8  Assigned to Kolja A., who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1569 requires the payor of
            a PO to submit a TO.  If someone other than the payor
            satisfies the PO, the requirement on the payor remains.

CFJ 1150  "One, or both, of the following assertions are true, to wit, 
           firstly, that Elysion is guilty of Tardiness in not
           reporting to Steve regarding the ex-Player Morendil's
           Denaria holdings within one week of Steve being assigned as
           Trustee for Morendil, or secondly, that Steve is guilty of
           Tardiness in not posting to the Public Forum a Probate Plan
           for Morendil within one week of having received from all
           extant Recordkeepors reports regarding Morendil's holdings
           in the Currencies for which they were respectively
           Recordkeepors, the transmission of said reports being
           mandated by Steve's assignment as Trustee for Morendil."
          8/1   Called by Morendil
          8/3   Assigned to Michael

CFJ 1151  "R.1896 (c) (iii) implicitly designates a Player who is a 
           Legislator to temporarily be a Voting Entity after having 
           satisfied certain conditions (eg, transferring 6 Amoeba to 
           the Bank)."
          8/3   Called by harvel
          8/3   Assigned to Murphy

CFJ 1152  "If a Rule implicitly designates a Player who is a Legislator
[FALSE]    to temporarily be a Voting Entity, then such implicit
           designation is sufficient to allow that Player to vote."
          8/3   Called by harvel
          8/3   Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 206 states that a Voting
            Entity may lack authorization to vote.

CFJ 1153  "If the Rules implicitly designate a Player who is a
[FALSE]    Legislator to be a Voting Entity temporarily, and that
           Player is not otherwise denied voting privileges, then that
           Player may vote."
          8/3    Called by harvel
          8/3-5  Supposedly assigned to Peekee, who made emself
                   ineligible; assignment prevented by Rule 897
          8/6-7  Assigned to Annabel, who Judges FALSE

CFJ 1154  "A Player who is On Hold may not be assigned as a Trustee for
[FALSE]    an entity in Probate."
          8/1   Called by Morendil
          8/6   Assigned to Wes, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1584 prevents it.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Naming a Player as Trustee is
            not itself a requirement for that Player to perform or
            avoid any action.  Rule 1584 probably prevents the usual
            requirements of Rule 1738; those requirements are in terms
            of ASAP, and Rule 1023 (which defines ASAP) defers to Rules
            regarding the responsibilities of Players On Hold.

CFJ 1155? "Honourary Players of Agora are considered Registered Players
           of Agora by entities which exist entirely outside the Agora
           Nomic Rules."
          8/8   Called by The Colonel
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 869 should be interpreted
            so as to make this statement false.
