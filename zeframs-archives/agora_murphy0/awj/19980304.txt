PROBATE

OFFICES

All times are in GMT.

Recent Election winners:
  Accountor           - Crito, General Chaos; nominations close 3/6
  Archivist           - Steve (tie broken by Speaker Steve)
  Assessor            - General Chaos (re-Elected by Acclamation)
  Chancellor          - General Chaos (tie broken by Speaker Steve)
  Clerk of the Courts - elJefe (re-Elected)

It is notable that all but two of the contested Elections were won by
the Threat Nominee.

3/3  Sherlock calls for the Impeachment of ten Offices (plus the
       Speakership, which isn't an Office).  This begins a Referendum
       for each Office.  However, the Ruleset does not define any
       effect of being Impeached.


INTERNOMIC
----------

2/24  INP 360 is adopted.

      Agora will vote for INP 363.

3/2   INPs 361 and 362 are rejected.


OTHER
-----

2/23  Time Agent Rebels.

2/27  Jester COEs the Ruleset twice, on the grounds that two Proposals
        of the form "the following Rule changes do not occur" were
        rejected, therefore the Rule changes in question occur.  Both
        COEs are denied, on the grounds that rejected Proposals have
        Power=3D0 and thus cannot cause Rule changes.

3/3   Kolja A. and Harlequin Rebel.  Unless more Players register or a
        Rebel becomes Abiding, this will trigger another Revolt on
        March 13.
