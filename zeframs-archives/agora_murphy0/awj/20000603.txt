      THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
      VOLUME 46, ISSUE 18
      June 3, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Mistakes Happen 2" by Taral - Proposal 4012 adopted 6/1
   Misappropriation is a Class 15 (not 20) Crime, and only occurs when
     the Executor of a Bank Currency executes (not submits) an improper
     Transfer Order.

"New Terminology" by Wes - Proposal 4011 adopted 6/1
   "Fees" are defined.
   Any communication required to be made "publicly" shall be sent to the
     Public Forum.  However, "post" and "distribute" are no longer explicitly
     defined as PF-equivalent.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Kinder Blot Penalties" by Taral - Proposal 4013 rejected 6/1
   Players must have more than 10 (not 5) Blots to be Mute, and more than
     10 (not 3) Blots to be Denied.

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral - Proposal 4009 failed quorum 5/22
   The Speaker may Delegate Offices that e holds temporarily, without the
     usual two-week maximum on the period of Delegation.
   Delegated Offices are not actually held by the Delegating Player.

"Work for All" by Taral - Proposal 4010 failed quorum 5/22
   Players may Nominate for Office, regardless of eir Blots.

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Agoran Time" by t
   Agora uses GMT generally, with no daylight savings time.  Days, weeks,
     months, quarters, and years are generally defined, as are periodic
     requirements and relative periods of time.

"Appeal fix 2" by Taral
   The dismissal of a CFJ is explicitly allowed to be Appealed.

"Extreme Measures" by Taral
   A Legislator may, Without Objection and With 2 Senate Supporters,
     cause a Proposal in the Proposal Queue to be adopted.

"Fix Scores" by t
   Gaining a Patent Title no longer causes a Score increase.
   Passing a Disinterested Proposal no longer causes a Score increase.
   Passing an Interested Proposal used to cause a Score increase of
     (2 * number of AGAINST votes).  It now causes (2 * number of
     AGAINST votes) or (4 * number of AGAINST voters), whichever is
     greater; but any AGAINST votes cast by the submitter of the Proposal
     are ignored for this purpose.

"Fix Wins" by t
   An announcement of a Win must identify all Players eligible to Win
     at that time.

"More Fully Baked Oligarchy" by Kelly
   Any Oligarchy vacancies are Auctioned by the Speaker.  All such winners
     start out as Low Oligarchs.
   When selecting a new High Oligarch, the previous High Oligarch is
     ineligible.
   Selections occur immediately and automatically if there is only one
     candidate, or when a majority of selectors is established.
   Oligardiness is committed only by individuals who fail to make an
     individual recommendation.
   If the Speaker must make a selection, e has seven days to do so, or
     else e becomes Tainted.  If the Speakership changes before a
     selection is made, then the new Speaker has seven days to select.

"More Score balancing" by Taral
   Being the sole person to Vote either FOR or AGAINST someone else's
     Proposal causes a Score increase of 2 (not 10).

"Oh, what a tangled web..." by Kelly
   To grant or revoke PF status to a medium of communication, the Registrar
     must send eir announcement via a single medium that is a PF both before
     and after the change.  Sending it via one medium that is a PF before
     but not after, and another medium that is a PF after but not before,
     is no longer sufficient.
   The Registrar may, Without Objection, grant or revoke Discussion Forum
     status to a medium.  Any medium that becomes a PF ceases to be a DF.
   Sending a message to a DF is not sending it to the PF, even if each
     Active Player is reasonably certain to receive it via that DF; and
     is not sending it to a given Player, unless the Player explicitly or
     implicitly confirms receipt.

"Property and Democracy" by Kelly
   Property is a generalization of Currency.  Units of non-Currency
     Property are distinguishable.
   Transfer Orders are replaced with Notices of Transfer.
   Payment Orders are replaced with Debts.
   Debts may be satisfied or forgiven.
   If a Notice of Transfer claims to be for debt payment, but does not
     correspond to any current debt, then it shall either be retained
     as payment against future debt, or returned (voluntarily or on
     demand).
   One may Order the payment of a debt.  Then Persistent Indebtedness
     occurs every seven days till the debt is paid.  Such an Order shall
     be stayed if the debt is disputed (this can also be done by the CotC
     or a Judge), or vacated if the debt is satisfied by another entity
     (this can also be done by a Judge).
   Property owned by an Executor-less entity is Abandoned.  The Notary
     is a Limited Executor of such an entity, and may use its Property
     to pay its debts; forgive debts owed to it; and (Without Objection)
     transfer its Property to the Bank.
   The Bank is a single entity.  The Treasuror is Executor of the
     Bank.  Each Bank Currency's Recordkeepor is a Limited Executor of
     the Bank, and may access only that Currency.
   The Treasuror may forgive debts owed to the Bank when Ordered to do so,
     or Without Objection.
   Ideal Indulgence Circulation Level (IICL) = # Players + # Player Blots.
   Actual Indulgence Circulation Level (AICL) = # Indulgences not owned by
     Bank + # Indulgences auctioned but bids not yet paid.
   Monthly Indulgence Auction for (IICL - AiCL) Indulgences.
   Proposals are Democratic if distributed while there are less than
     three Oligarchs.
   Voting on Ordinary Proposals is free.
   A Player may vote on a Proposal once, plus once per Voting Entitlement
     (a new Currency), minus once per five Blots; minimum 0, maximum 5.
   A non-Player may vote on a Proposal once per Voting Entitlement,
     maximum 3.  However, the Bank may not vote on any Proposal.
   Ideal VE Circulation Level (IVECL) = # Players.
   Actual VE Circulation Level (AVECL) = # VEs not owned by Bank + # VEs
     auctioned but bids not yet paid.
   VE Auction for (IVECL - AVECL) VEs whenever this is positive.  Bids
     in VTs.
   A High Oligarch may retain no VEs, a Middle Oligarch one, and a Low
     Oligarch two.  Possessing more VEs than this for 5 days continuously
     causes loss of Oligarch position.

"Ratification" by Taral
   The most recent version of each of the Promotor's Reports is ratified.

"Say Something" by Taral
   When a Proposal's Voting Period ends, any Active Player who was
     eligible to Vote on it, but who didn't Vote or declare Presence
     on any Proposals in the past month, commits the Class 0.5
     Infraction of Failure to Vote.

"Speaker Delegation" by Taral
   The Speaker may Delegate Offices that e holds temporarily, without the
     usual two-week maximum on the period of Delegation.
   Delegated Offices are not actually held by the Delegating Player.

"Taral's Work for All, Again" by Elysion
   Players may Nominate for Office, regardless of eir Blots.

"Whitespace in Rules" by Kelly
   Certain types of change in whitespace are required/allowed without
     being a Rule Change.  All other types of change in whitespace are
     explicitly defined as Rule Changes.

"Work for All" by Taral
   Players may Nominate for Office, regardless of eir Blots.

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Das Kapital" by Elysion
   The Priest may Auction any number of Indulgences per month, up to the
     number e is currently required to Auction.
   After each Indulgence Auction, the Priest receives a percentage
     commission on the total IAT bill for winning bids.  This commission
     ranges from 0% to 20% (initially 5%), and is part of the Budget.
   The Priest may not bid in an Indulgence Auction.

"Definition of Noisy, Quiet, and Silent" by harvel
   Rule 1042 (Zombification Due to Silence) is re-Titled and streamlined.
   A Player is always exactly one of Noisy, Quiet, or Silent.

"Dependent Action tweaks" by Murphy
   An action performed Dependently is explicitly defined as a Dependent
     Action.
   A Dependent Action is explicitly allowed to require both non-Objection
     and Support.
   "Without N <condition> Objections" and "With N <condition> Supporters"
     allow shorthand restriction on whose Objection or Support is
     effective.  "<condition>" may be "Officer", "Oligarch", "Senator", etc.

"Dismissals May Be Appealed" by Murphy
   The dismissal of a CFJ is explicitly allowed to be Appealed.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1212 "Wes became the High Oligarch on Wed, 3 May 2000 12:48:35 +0300."
[TRUE]   5/4    Called by t
          5/4-7  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          5/7-8  Appealed by Steve, Taral, and Elysion
          5/9    Appeal assigned to lee, Blob, and harvel
          5/13   harvel and lee move to overturn and reassign
          5/18   Blob is replaced by Crito on the Board of Appeals
          5/19   Crito moves to overturn and assign
          5/20   Assigned to Elysion
          5/24   Elysion Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1937 (Filling Vacancies in the
            Oligarchy) specifies that the Low Oligarchs select a Middle
            Oligarch to become High Oligarch, but does not specify when the
            selection takes effect.  Reasonable possibilities are:
              #1) Wed, 3 May 2000 09:49:12 +0100 - Majority established
              #2) Wed, 3 May 2000 12:48:35 +0300 - All three votes cast
              #3) Thu, 4 May 2000 00:00:00 GMT   - Three-day deadline expires
          Judge Peekee's argument (summary):  #2 is correct.
          Judge Elysion's argument (summary):  #1 is incorrect; the selection
            is not done yet.  #2 is correct; in the absence of explicit
            specification, the most reasonable interpretation is that the
            selection causes the Middle Oligarch to become High Oligarch
            immediately after it is completed.

CFJ 1214 "If we post to a Public Forum a message in the form "If and only
[TRUE]    if we have not transferred VTs to t in the last 2 days, we
           transfer 10 VTs to t.", and we have indeed made no transfers to
           t in the 2 days previous to sending this message, and if there
           are no general conditions preventing any transfer of 10 VTs
           (such as a lack of funds), then 10 VTs are transferred from us
           to t. If, however, we had transferred VTs to t 4 hours before
           this message reached the Public Forum, then no VTs would be
           transferred as a direct result of this posting."
          5/14     Called by Wes
          5/15-19  Assigned to Taral, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A statement "Iff X, I do Y" is
            equivalent to exactly one of ("I do Y", "").  Which one
            depends on whether or not X is true.
          Judge's commentary (summary):  It is in the best interest of the
            game to allow conditions that can be fully resolved by consulting
            information publically available at the time the condition is
            stated.

CFJ 1215 "If we post to a Public Forum a message in the form "If and only
[FALSE]   if t is standing up at the time we wrote this message, we
           transfer 10 VTs to t.", and t is indeed standing up at the time
           we wrote the message, and if there are no general conditions
           preventing any transfer of 10 VTs (such as a lack of funds),
           then 10 VTs are transferred from us to t."
          5/14     Called by Wes
          5/15-19  Assigned to lee, who recuses emself
          5/27     Chuck Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  A statement "Iff X, I do Y" is
            equivalent to exactly one of ("I do Y", "").  Which one
            depends on whether or not X is true.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  This condition is practically
            impossible to decide, and it is thus in the best interests
            of the game to disallow the Gamestate from hinging on it.

CFJ 1216 "A Player who holds a wage-earning Office at the time Salaries
[FALSE]   are paid out is paid the Salary for that Office, regardless of
           the amount of time e has held that Office."
          5/16     Called by Taral
          5/17-18  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1940 requires each (periodic
            compensation required to be paid out) to be paid out by the
            appropriate Officer at the beginning of the month.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  If an Office was held by a Player
            for less than 12 days of the previous month, then that Office's
            salary - despite being a periodic compensation - is not required
            to be paid out.

CFJ 1217 "TYHJÄ is not an obvious synonym of one of FOR, AGAINST or
[DISMISS] ABSTAIN, as specified in Rule 683, and therefore is not a vote
           upon a Proposal."
          5/21  Kelly attempts to dismiss (but may fail; see CFJ 1219)
          Judge's argument (summary):  The truth of the statement depends
            on whether the Assessor understands TYHJÄ as an obvious synonym,
            which may change when the Assessorship changes.

CFJ 1218 "The insertion of a blank line in a Rule is a Rule change"
[FALSE]  5/18     Called by Palnatoke
          5/18-25  Assigned to t, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's argument (summary):  Rule changes must be written down,
            and changes in whitespace are necessarily different between
            handwritten and printed/electronic media, so it is game custom
            and in the best interests of the game that Rule 1339's view of
            whitespace be given general application.

CFJ 1219 "CFJ 1217 was not Dismissed."
[FALSE]  5/22     Called by Wes
Appealed 5/22     Assigned to Steve, who Judges FALSE
          5/23-24  Appealed by Wes and lee
          6/2      Appealed by Murphy
          6/2      Appeal assigned to Sherlock, Crito, and Peekee
          Caller's argument (summary):  Kelly attempted to dismiss CFJ 1217
            under Rule 1565 vi), but vi) is not actually true.  Rule 1565
            says that the dismissal is thus not legal, and does not occur
            (because the CotC was not notified of a legal dismissal).
          Why 1565 vi) is not true:  Kelly stated that the truth of CFJ 1217's
            statement changes over time, but Rule 451 gives import only to the
            truth at the time the CFJ was called.  A reasonable effort to
            determine this for CFJ 1217 would consist simply of getting the
            current Assessor's answer to "do you understand TYHJÄ as an
            obvious synonym for one of FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN?".
          Judge's refutation (summary):  A Judgement not in accordance with
            the Rules is still a Judgement.
          Counterargument:  Dismissal is not a Judgement.  Rule 1565 may
            place a technical requirement on dismissal that has no analogue
            applying to Judgements.  Does Kelly's belief in the truth of 1565
            vi) count toward dismissing it "for the reasons listed in this
            Rule [1565]"?

CFJ 1220 "Blob is currently eligible to Judge CFJs concerning conditional
           statements."
          5/22  Called by Palnatoke
          5/22  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's argument (summary):  Blob became ineligible to Judge *any*
            CFJs until further notice (via private message to CotC harvel)
            before this CFJ was called.

CFJ 1221 "There are no Payment Orders in Stems naming Peekee as the Payor"
[FALSE]  5/24  Called by Peekee
          5/28  Wes Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Payment Orders still exist, even if
            they are satisfied.  See CFJ 1226.

CFJ 1222 "The message sent to the Business List by Elysion containing the text
[FALSE]   'The Bank pays all its outstanding IAT POs' did not cause any 
Transfer
           Orders to be executed."
          5/24     Called by Kelly
          5/25-31  Assigned to Crito, who Judges FALSE
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Elysion's message unambiguously 
specified
            a set of Payment Orders, each of which e implicitly paid with a
            Transfer Order.  This set has been confirmed as non-empty.

CFJ 1223 "lee started eir current occupation of the Office of Notary prior to
[TRUE]    midnight GMT on May 23, 2000."
          5/25      Called by lee
          5/28-6/2  Assigned to Peekee, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Blob resigned as Notary on 5/15 without
            naming a successor.  This caused em to be removed from the Office
            and replaced by Speaker lee.

CFJ 1224 "Elysion's message of 11 April 2000, reading in part, 'The Bank pays
           all its outstanding IAT POs (50 to Michael and 75 to Chuck)', 
did not
           have the effect of executing a Transfer Order which would 
satisfy the
           Payment Order executed by lee in eir message dated 11 March 2000,
           reading in part, 'I order the Bank to pay Murphy 130 IATs.'"
          5/26  Called by Kelly
          5/29  Assigned to Sherlock
          Caller's argument (summary):  Due to a mail server glitch, lee's 
message
            was not generally distributed till May 23.  The falsity of this CFJ
            would imply that Elysion paid a Transfer Order without knowing that
            it existed.

CFJ 1225 "The Transfer Orders which Peekee issued in the email identified by
[TRUE]    Message-ID: <20000524113533.52162.qmail@hotmail.com> were improperly
           or invalidly executed."
          5/28  Called by Wes
          5/28     Wes submits a Motion to vacate any or all of the 
Transfer Orders
                     in question; see Rule 1809
          5/29-30  Assigned to Palnatoke, who Judges TRUE and grants the Motion
          6/2      Appealed by Peekee
          Judge's argument (summary):  The first and third of the Orders in
            question would result in Peekee possessing negative Currency, so
            their attempts to satisfy a Payment Order are unsuccessful, and
            Rule 1598 thus invalidates them.  The second of the Orders attempts
            to require the transfer of a negative number of entities.

CFJ 1226 "The Transfer Orders which Peekee issued in the email identified by
           Message-ID: <20000524113533.52162.qmail@hotmail.com> satisfied the
           Stem Payment Orders as mentioned in the same email."
          5/29  Called by Peekee.

CFJ 1227 "A Low Oligarch who is entitled to cast any vote at all upon a given
           Ordinary Proposal may cast a vote of ABSTAIN upon that Proposal."
          5/29  Called by Kelly
          5/30  Assigned to Murphy
