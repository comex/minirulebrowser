CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
[TRUE]    4/24       Called by Blob
          4/26-30    Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          4/30-5/12  Appealed by Steve and elJefe
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

CFJ 1126  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
Appealed   Crime of Misrepresentation by listing 'janet9981@yahoo.com'
           as the 'From:' address."
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/2  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          5/6-7     Appealed by Blob, Chuck, Michael, and Crito
          5/7       Appeal assigned to Crito, Blob, and Morendil
          Caller's argument (summary):  Steve believed the information
            in question to be incorrect, the criterion of Rule 1497.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  It is unclear that Rule 1497
            applies to message headers.  It is unclear that Steve sent
            the message in question.

CFJ 1127  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines
           12-13 of the body of the message,
           'If your website isn't located in the top-30 listings of
            these engines, chances are your site will never be seen.'"
          4/30  Called by Chuck
          4/30  Assigned to David
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1126.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Steve did not present this
            information as correct.

CFJ 1131  "The message sent to the Public Forum with headers which read
           in part:

Message-Id:<3.0.1.32.19990406101136.009bcec-@proxy.pn.beam.com.au>
            Date: Fri, 16 Apr 1999 10:11:36 +1000
            To: agora-busines-@gecko.serc.rmit.edu.au
            From: janet998-@yahoo.com
            Subject: Maximize your website's traffic!
           was sent by Steve."
          5/3  Called by Steve
          5/6  Assigned to Murphy
          Caller's argument (summary):  A preponderance of evidence
            (the criterion of Rule 1575) supports the statement.

CFJ 1132? "Chuck has violated Rule 1434 (Default Procedure for
           Referendum Voting) by failing to perform his duties as Vote
           Collector."
          5/12  Called by Steve
          Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck's Referendum to Impeach
            Steve as Clerk of the Courts failed automatically, because
            no results were announced within a week after the Voting
            Period ended.  Steve equates this with violation of Rule
            1434's requirement to announc results.
