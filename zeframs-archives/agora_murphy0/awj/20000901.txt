      THE AGORAN WEEKLY JOURNAL
      VOLUME 47, ISSUE 4
      September 1, 2000


ADOPTED PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Fix Rule 559" by harvel - Proposal 4057 adopted 8/27
   Remove a redundant requirement for the Registrar to report Active/
     Inactive status.

"Fix the Stupid Bug" by t - Proposal 4056 adopted 8/20
   Auctioned Papyri are paid out by the Promotor, not the Accountor.

"General budgets" by Oerjan - Proposal 4054 adopted 8/20
   Budgets are defined as a general class, with the Treasuror's Budget
     as one instance.

"Minor fix" by Peekee - Proposal 4058 adopted 8/27
   Correct a doubled "the" in Rule 1946 (Distribution of Voting
     Entitlements).

"The Grand Warden of the Oligarchy" by harvel - Proposal 4053 adopted 8/20
   The GWO tracks the status of the Oligarchy, and must also announce
     vacancies in the Oligarchy.

REJECTED PROPOSALS
------------------

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee - Proposal 4055 failed quorum 8/20
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.

"The CotC's Budget" by Oerjan - Proposal 4059 rejected 8/27
   The CotC's Budget determines the Class of all Crimes and Infractions.
   Once per 30 days, the CotC may amend eir Budget with 2 Supporters, but
     may not change any one Class by more than 1.  (However, e may add or
     remove a Crime or Infraction.)
   The Class of a Crime may be from 0 to 15, an Infraction from 0 to 5
     (except Dereliction of Duty, which is resolved as an Infraction but
     may be penalized as if it were a Crime).

PENDING PROPOSALS
-----------------

"Fix Rule 1614" by harvel - Proposal 4064
   Remove a spurious "either" from the Rule.

"Judicial Deregulation" by Elysion
   Repeal Rule 1871 (Turns for All).

"One-shot rule cleanup" by Taral - Proposal 4065
   Repeal Rules 1943 (Continuity of the Bank) and 1949 (Continuity of Debt),
     left over from the conversion from Payment Orders to Debts.

"Respect for the dead" by Peekee
   Wills are re-defined, and the Notary may carry them out as e sees fit
     when handling Abandoned Property.  However, before transferring a
     type of Property according to an entity's Will, all the entity's
     debts for that type of Property at the time of Abandoning must first
     be satisfied.

"Rule cleanup" by Taral - Proposal 4063
   Repeal Rule 1927 (Bank Currency Creation).

"The Court of Equity" by Taral
   Debts found invalid by CFJ are cancelled.
   Reporting a known-invalid debt is the Class 10 Crime of Extortion.
   Rule 1742 (Agreements Between Players) is updated from Payment Order
     style language to Debt style language.
   Fees are changed from up-front costs to debts.
   Private Orders are explicitly made valid unless specified otherwise,
     but are prohibited from requiring or restricting Property transfer
     except to satisfy debts of the entity being Ordered.

"What is Public?" by Wes - Proposal 4066
   Any communication sent to a PF is deemed to have been sent to all Players.
   Any communication sent to a DF (Discussion Forum) is deemed not to have
     been sent to all Players.
   Any communication sent to all Players is deemed to have been made Publicly.
   This collects all PF timing requirements into a single place.
   Throughout the rest of the Ruleset, requirements to send something to the
     PF are replaced with requirements to do them Publicly.
   Oh, and "ProSiRuP is Marvy" is hidden in the middle of the dreary part of
     the Proposal.  (Agora's first known instance of scam by obscurity occurred
     in early 1997:  "Murphy Wins" was embedded in a Proposal assigning names
     to then-nameless Crimes/Infractions, to avoid ambiguity of Double 
Jeopardy.)

PROTO-PROPOSALS
---------------

"Bluff Auctions" by Blob
   Bluff Auctions are conducted using normal poker rules.
   Maximum starting Bid is 20 times the MUQ of the Auction Currency.
   Bids may be raised from a non-winning value, but may not exceed the
     previously-top Bid by more than 20 times the MUQ.
   Upon the end of a Bluff Auction, all non-Winning Bids are billed to
     their Bidders.  Winning Bids are determined by Bid amount, with
     ties broken by poker hand rank.
   Anyone may conduct a re-deal Without Objection from Players holding at
     at least four Cards.

"Fee Stuff" by Taral
   Fees are debts defined as such, but may not be Ordered paid.

"Judicial Cleanup" by Peekee
   A CFJ may be Withdrawn by the CotC (thus ceasing to be a CFJ) if:
     * It contains no single clearly identifiable Statement.
     * The Caller requests it, and its outcome would be trivial.
     * It is an Excess CFJ.
   Executor-related restrictions are moved to Rule 698 (Always an
     Eligible Judge).
   The CotC may recuse a Judge:
     * If e goes On Hold.
     * With 2 Supporters.
     * If it is 7 days past the end of the Deliberation Period and e
         still has not delivered Judgement.
   The Board of Appeals is deemed to act once an unchangeable majority
     is attained.
   Redundant statements of the revocation of Judicial salaries are
     repealed.
   Clarifies that a Call for Appeal must be properly executed before it
     permits the stay of a Judicial Order.

"Silencing the People" by Andre
   Making someone Quiet who has posted to the PF during the past seven days
     is a Crime.

"The Dole" by Murphy
   Players on the Dole get one Blot expunged per month, but give up
     receiving eir Minimum Income to do so.


CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1234  "Kudos are Property."
[TRUE]    7/19     Called by Murphy
           7/20-27  Assigned to Kelly, who Judges TRUE
           7/27-28  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, and Peekee
                      (Blob attempts to appeal in a-d)
           7/29     Appeal assigned to lee (by mistake), Taral, and Wes
           7/30     lee, Taral, and Wes all move to sustain
           7/30     Speaker Chuck takes eir proper seat on the Board
           8/2      Murphy moves that Judge Kelly return half eir Judicial
                      Salary to the Bank
           8/3      Chuck moves to sustain
           8/7      Kelly alleges that e is no longer Judge of this CFJ,
                      as Rule 408 makes em ineligible after 7 days (even
                      though e delivered Judgement within that time)
           8/20     Wes claims that Kelly is guilty of Slow Motion
           8/20     Kelly recused; Motion reassigned to Taral, who denies it
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 1062 says that Players
             possess Kudos.  Rule 1942 defines any entity possessible
             by another Player as Property.

CFJ 1237  "The Order issued by Chuck on Sun, 23 Jul 2000 17:17:02 -0500
[FALSE]    was valid."
Appealed  7/25       Called by Taral
           7/26-27    Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
           7/30       Taral moves that Chuck be Ordered to pay the Bank 24
                        P-Notes, the amount that Chuck received as a result
                        of the Order in question.
           7/30       Oerjan grants the motion
           7/30-8/19  Appealed by Murphy, Chuck, Steve, and Oerjan
           8/20       Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Wes
           8/20       Taral (ineligible because e is the Caller) replaced
                        by Steve
           8/20       Wes moves to overturn and reassign
           8/21       Chuck (allegedly ineligible because e made emself
                        ineligible to Judge this CFJ on 8/1; see CFJ xxxx)
                        allegedly replaced by Murphy
           8/24       Steve moves to overturn and reverse
           8/24       Improperly reassigned to Elysion (Wes's and Steve's
                        motions were noted, but Taral's attempted motion
                        on 8/20 should have been ignored)
           8/30       Murphy recused and replaced by Kelly
           Caller's argument for FALSE (summary):  Chuck transferred some
             P-Notes for the purpose of paying a Fee.  The P-Note payment
             succeeded, but the Fee payment failed.  The Rules do not
             require that Players be reimbursed for failed Fee payments.
             Rule 1796 permits the validity of Chuck's Order to be proven
             by CFJ only if its execution is required by the Rules.
           Counterargument:  Rule 1796 also permits the validity of the
             Order to be proven by CFJ if its execution is "permitted in"
             the circumstances existing when it was executed; and the Rules
             do not prohibit or regulate the creation of a Private Order,
             thus such creation is permitted by Rule 101.
           Justice Steve's argument (summary):  Rule 101's permission is
             not turned off by the regulation of Orders generally.  It *is*
             turned off by the regulation of Private Orders specifically, by
             Rule 1808.  But the execution of Private Orders is permitted by
             Rules 1794 and 1808 directly, without involving Rule 101.
           Concurring opinion (summary):  Rule 1808 does not regulate any
             aspect of Private Orders, except to state that an attempt to
             execute one is ineffectual unless sent to the Player at whom
             the Order is directed.

CFJ 1240  "Kelly is not the Judge of CFJ 1234."
[FALSE]   8/8      Called by Kelly
Appealed  8/9-14   Assigned to t, who Judges FALSE
           8/14-17  Appealed by Steve, Palnatoke, Kelly, Taral, Wes, and Peekee
           8/15     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Wes
           8/18     Chuck makes emself ineligible
           8/20     Taral moves to overturn and reassign
           8/20     Wes moves to overturn and reassign
           8/30     Chuck recused and replaced by Blob
           8/30     Blob moves to overturn and reassign
           Caller's argument (summary):  Rule 408 says that Judge become
             ineligible seven days after the end of the Deliberation Period,
             and does not explicitly restrict that clause to cases in which
             the Judge fails to deliver Judgement by that time.
           Counterargument (summary):  But it may implicitly restrict that
             clause to such cases.

CFJ 1242  "Palnatoke is Off Hold."
[FALSE]   8/22     Called by Palnatoke
           8/22-23  Assigned to Andre, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  Palnatoke stated on July 31 that e
             would come Off Hold at midnight, August 12.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  Rule 1016 says that one may come
             Off Hold only as specified in the Rules, and is also the only
             Rule to specify how to come Off Hold.  No message stating that
             one comes Off Hold may be interpreted to take effect later, or
             else all such messages could be thus interpreted.

CFJ 1243  "Chuck is ineligible to serve as a Justice in the Appeal of CFJ
[TRUE]     1237."
Appealed  8/21     Called by Steve
           8/22-24  Assigned to Wes, who Judges TRUE
           8/25-26  Appealed by Andre, Crito, harvel, Oerjan, and Kelly
           8/25     Andre creates and signs an Application to Submit an
                      Opinion, to force the official recording of eir
                      Dissenting Opinion
           8/25     Crito signs Andre's Application
           8/27     harvel and Steve sign Andre's Application
           8/28     Andre submits and executes eir Application
           8/30     Appeal assigned to Chuck, Taral, and Andre
           Caller's argument (summary):  Chuck made emself ineligible to Judge
             CFJ 1237 on August 1.  When CFJ was called, Chuck was ineligible
             only due to Rule 1871, which does not affect the Board.  However,
             there may be some Rules that use "Judge" to include Justices too.
           Counterargument (summary):  No, there aren't.  The Rules restrict
             the correctness of Judges and Judgements; they restrict Justices
             only to decide whether the Judge did what e should have.
           Judge's concurring opinion (summary):  The object of "it" in Rule
             911's "when it was called" is "the Appeal".
           Counterargument (summary):  No, the object is "the CFJ".  The time
             that an Appeal is called is undefined anyway, though it would
             presumably be the earliest time at which there exist sufficient
             insistences on Appeal.  Rule 541 iii) and iv) use "the matter
             the Board is to consider" - a phrase similar to one in Rule 911
             - in apparently inconsistent ways, but this is resolved if the
             phrase is interpreted as "the Judicial process regarding a given
             CFJ".  Transferring that interpretation to the context of Rule
             911, the only sensible interpretation of "when a Judicial process
             was called" is "when the original CFJ was called".

CFJ 1244  "A given Rule's title is a substantive property of that Rule, and
[FALSE]    so may be changed as a Rule Change."
           8/23     Called by Peekee
           8/24-26  Assigned to Blob, who Judges FALSE
           Caller's argument (summary):  The Rules may refer to a Rule by 
title.
           Judge's refutation (summary):  The Rules do not currently do so, and
             until they do, Rule titles will be non-substantive.  Rule 1485
             explicitly states that Rule titles have no inherent effect on the
             meaning or application of the Rule.

CFJ 1245  "The Speaker has failed to initiate an Election for the Office of
            Grand Warden of the Oligarchy as required by the Rules."
           8/24  Called by Taral
           8/24  Assigned to Chuck
           Caller's argument (summary):  GWotO has no Electee, so the Rule "The
             Order of Temporary Succession" applies.


OFFICES/OLIGARCHS
-----------------

8/21  lee improperly announces an Election for Grand High Warden of the
         Oligarchy, and attempts to Nominate for same.
