CALLS FOR JUDGEMENT
-------------------

CFJ 1124  "Votes sent to the agora-discussion mailing list are neither
[TRUE]     'sent publically' nor 'sent privately', and so are not valid
           when voting is Unrestricted."
          4/20     Called by Blob
          4/20-25  Assigned to Elysion, who Judges TRUE
          Caller's argument (summary):  By defining the Public and
            Private modes of Voting, Rule 1764 defines "publically" and
            "privately".  Messages to a-d fit neither definition.

CFJ 1125  "Rule 1883 has not been repealed."
[TRUE]    4/24     Called by Blob
          4/26-30  Assigned to Crito, who Judges TRUE
          4/30     Appealed by Steve
          Caller's argument (summary):  "An Object Lesson" was embedded
            in a spam message, so did not give a "clear indication" of
            being a Proposal as required by Rule 1483.

CFJ 1126  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by listing 'janet9981@yahoo.com'
           as the 'From:' address."
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/2  Assigned to harvel, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  Steve believed the information
            in question to be incorrect, the criterion of Rule 1497.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  It is unclear that Rule 1497
            applies to message headers.  It is unclear that Steve sent
            the message in question.

CFJ 1127  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
           'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines
           12-13 of the body of the message,
           'If your website isn't located in the top-30 listings of
            these engines, chances are your site will never be seen.'"
          4/30  Called by Chuck
          4/30  Assigned to David
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1126.

CFJ 1128  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines
           138-155 of the body of the message,
           'Here's a sampling of some results we've acheived for
            previous clients. (These examples are for competitive
            keywords--not just obscure words on which no one is
            conducting searches.)
            <> 6 top-10 rankings on Infoseek for different relevant
            keywords
            <> 18 top-10 rankings across the major search engines
            <> 3 top-10 rankings on Alta Vista for one keyword
            <> 16 total *number one* rankings
            <> 40 top-30 rankings, spread across the different engines.
            <> 1 to 2 hits per week increased to 500 per day
            <> 45,000 hits per month grew to 108,000.'"
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/3  Assigned to Oerjan, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1126.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Steve did not present this
            information as correct.

CFJ 1129  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines
           188-189 of the body of the message,
           '<> Call us--we'll answer any questions you may have and
            provide a no-cost initial consultation.  (310) 859-4659'"
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/4  Assigned to Blob, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1126.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Steve did not necessarily
            present this information as correct, nor did e necessarily
            believe it was incorrect.

CFJ 1130  "In posting a message to agora-business with the subject
[FALSE]    'Maximize your website's traffic!', Steve committed the
           Crime of Misrepresentation by stating, on or around lines
           250-252 of the body of the message,
           'Search Engine Success Group - Call us at: (310) 859-4659'"
          4/30      Called by Chuck
          4/30-5/7  Assigned to Murphy, who Judges FALSE
          Caller's argument (summary):  See CFJ 1126.
          Judge's refutation (summary):  Steve did not believe this
            information was incorrect.  A reasonable interpretation of
            the quoted text is to equate 'us' with the organization
            that originally authored the spam; in that context, the
            quoted text is likely truthful.

CFJ 1131? "The message sent to the Public Forum with headers which read
           in part:

Message-Id:<3.0.1.32.19990406101136.009bcec-@proxy.pn.beam.com.au>
